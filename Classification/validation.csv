8604,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,"Early Access Review* Ok Played the first DD loved the Idea of tower setups etc.* This game would be exciting to finally be officialy released with controller support.From the Positive reviews on here this game looks like it has lots to offer.According to the DEVS Sony is reponisible for controller support for this game, and so far it has not been implemented yet.I would like to see CONTROLLER SUPPORT implemented soon, so I can play this game finally. I hope this isn't an early acess for too long, I dont use KB _mouse setup with this game it is too difficult to play, as I never Use KB_mouse for most steam games.I can't wait to play this game with controller support!!!!!!!!!!!Please enable it soon!!! Like with DD1.",1
20407,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewSomeone randomly gave me this and I was like ""this looks dumb"" but then I tried it and immediately played it for an hour straight cause it's pretty fun.  It's like if in magic the gathering you could actually watch all the monsters fight each other.  Figuring out how to deal with all the insanity that the opponent is throwing at you feels good.",1
636,Magic Duels,2018.0,"Game is extremely unfun to play unless you want to spend money to get cards and go straight to multiplayer.The campaign are rigged to the extreme. You must use decks inferior to and countered by your opponents.The AI cheats to the extreme, always getting perfect starting hands and exactly what cards it needs to stop you.If you want to play magic and don't care about dropping real money to get cards then go for it.If you want a fair and relatively balanced game then don't even think about it.You only get small amounts of cards by completeing the campaigns anyway and you will redo the same duels over and over before finally getting cards in your hand that it is possible to win with. I played all the past magic games so I am used to the AI cheating but this was on a whole new level where they make your deck custome designed to be♥♥♥♥♥♥against your opponent.",0
10217,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis used to be an amazing game that i was more then happy to support. with every patch they get further from the quircky diferences that made RObocraft one of my favorite into somthing generic with a few gimics. if you played this in the past and liked it, avoid it. for new players you may like it.",0
9564,Realm of the Mad God,2014.0,"With stunning visuals, an immersive storyline, and more innovation than Counter Strike, I would glady give up my entire life to watch other people play this game on the lowest-spec PC's they could find.If you have autism, than this game is for you.",1
5743,PlanetSide 2,2018.0,"Don't trust the Steam playercharts!The reason this game seems to do so badly in terms of playernumbers, is because the vast majority of all players use the developers launcher instead of Steam to play this game. Naturally, they do not get tracked and that's exactly why there seem to be much less people online than there actually are. Not to mention, the large PS4 community doesn't get factored in aswell.After all these years no game managed to replace Planetside 2. It had some slip ups here end there, but over time, the playerbase and the dev team have grown.I can fully recommend this game. The first few hours can prove though to some, but once you get a grip and learn how to play, you will not want to go back to Battlefield or CoD (or whatever FPS you're into).Try it, it's free after all.",1
232,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is the first time i feel like writing a review for a game. This game is AWESOME, any hearthstone player will get into this pretty quickly, but its way deeper and has some nice and fresh mechanics. Has several fun single and multiplayer game modes, no restriction of farming ingame money like HS, in general a way more generous free to play model, tons of cards and its just in Beta. Just play it!",1
19697,School of Dragons,2016.0,"I was very thrilled to play this game after watching the films and series, but this game is very disappointing, Most of the new dragons that have been introduced in the series, are only for members only. They say that ""Nothing is for FREE these days""  Yet when I used to play games nothing was that hard to get, but these days its cash cash cash, Its very disapointing, but let me shed some light on this game before I get to the huge down fall, This game is going to be mostly recommneded to the fans of the 'How to Train Your Dragon' This games style and design looks a lot like the style of the series that is currently on Netflix, The characters of the main cast are in it and help you along the way, You even get to meet their dragons as well.The area of the game changes to the current season which is nice and you can recognize a lot of the areas. You get to raise your dragon from a baby to its adult form, very cute and you get to choose the colours, But you can't fly for a very long time. Reminded me of Istaria The animation mechanics are ok a little buggy but not bad Now here are the Down fallsSometimes when exiting the area, the loading screen will come up, it will nag you to get a membership, it will take a while to get to the next area, once it does, it will appear again before you can move on and do your quests or tasks around the area, Sadly sometimes when you say no to the membership the game will crash.I struggled to get out of this on wide screen, so if any of you have a PC that struggles to run these types of games, please keep it on window just incase it decides to crash on you.After the crash I decided to check the reviews, sadly all the negatives were right you take a few steps and it already crashes on you, exit an area to another it will crash, go fishing, it will lag so much as well as when you chop down trees for wood, it will lag so bad that your game will crash and freeze your pc.Another reason to keep it on window.Unfortunatly I had to get rid of the game due to the graphics and lagging on the game, it crashed 3 times.Loading it back up is more quicker than getting around the areas.Don't play this game if you dont want your pc to suffer from crashes and freezesPlay this game on window just to be safeBut overall I highly recommended you to not play this game, its needs much more work because it still looks like its in testing, it looks very much like the old graphics from a very old console, lets say ps1 sort of style, yes I know that sounds very harsh but its true. It also needs more free stuff than just membership stuff. The lag makes it very frustrating to play because you can hardly go anywhere. I am very disappointed in this game, but if your little ones would like to play it, make sure your pc can run alright on it, and keep it on window just be on the safe side, but don't be surprised if it crashes on window screens as well.

7317,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Product received for freeDo not play this game. It is a lag fest with tons of bugs (one is that you get back to the server selection after you choose your character) and even tho its 2016, there are MANY bots spamming in cities without control (you can't even mute them).If you wanna enjoy a game, go play something else.",0
913,Robocraft,2017.0,"An absolute shadow if its past.Gutted and butchered to shove in horrible microtransactions. Imbalanced matches where you will fight bots 3-4x more powerful than yours in every match.

2359,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"If you have an inkling of interest in games like the Battlefield series, but wish that the scale was bigger, that the game was entirely persistent, and that you as an individual, as a squad, or even as an entire team had an impact on the game as a whole, then Planetside 2 is for you.As an MMO, Planetside 2 delivers an experience that is as social and long-lasting as some of the bigger names in the MMO market, like World of Warcraft, Eve Online, and Final Fantasy XIV Online. As an FPS, Planetside 2 draws the most well-loved mechanics from heavy-hitting genre-changers like Battlefield, Halo, and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. This game is absolutely unique when it comes to the gaming landscape, only truly comparable to the original Planetside and the PS3 exclusive MAG, both of which were far smaller and less feature-rich than Planetside 2.Over the past two years, Planetside 2 has seen numerous updates. These range from new weapons, vehicles, and gear to entirely new continents, reworkings of existing continents, and mechanics which change the very foundation of how the game works, such as the lattice update and the larger-scale continental lattice. The game has even been optimized to run much better than it did in the alpha and beta stages of development, through the ""Operation: Make Faster Game"" or OMFG series of patches.Sony Online Entertainment, Planetside 2's developers, have always had an open ear toward the community, accepting feedback and tweaking the game according to the majority opinion, as well as implementing player-made items through the in-game store. SOE even displays the game's official ""roadmap"" on their website, allowing players to view the game's update schedule, as well as voting individual updates up and down and giving feedback on said updates, thus giving the developers an idea of what the community wants to see in the game.I mentioned an in-game store. This may lead you to believe that this game is slanted in favor of paying players. This is mostly untrue. Every player has access to every game-changing piece of gear in the game. The only things that are exclusive to customers who use the game's premium currency, Station Cash (SC), are cosmetic items (camoflauge, decals, vehicle horns, etc.) and consumables which increase the player's multiplier at which they earn experience. Players can also elect to subscribe to the game's subscription model, earning themselves a persistent experience boost which lasts until the subscription ends, 500 SC per every month subscribed, and priority in the queue to warp to an already-full continent once a slot is available. Fortunately, the game is entirely enjoyable without any premium benefits, and most players are perfectly happy having not spent a single cent in the in-game store. In the end, all you would be paying for is minor convenience, rather than game-breaking premium exclusives.Planetside 2 has quickly become one of the best games I've ever played, and I encourage anyone who has even a slight interest in the concept of an MMOFPS to give it a shot.",1
12898,War Thunder,2016.0,"The russian bias in this game for ground forces is so over the top its almost comedy. I dare you to play for a while, and watch what happens.1. The team with russian tanks drives to your spawn. your team kills a couple, but they invariably manage to get there as 1 shotting a russian tank isnt as common, but them one shotting everything else is.2. they camp your spawn and proceed to♥♥♥♥♥♥the map.3. the russian side wins.This game is about as far from a simulation as you can get if you go by WW2 statistics for russian losses.",0
1794,Champions Online,2012.0,"A superhero MMO best experienced with friends.Even in the free-to-play portion (also known as Silver members), the costume system has the greatest degree of customization that I've ever seen in an MMO (and you can unlock a number of pieces through certain events - let me state that content the F2P crowd can unlock is a GREAT idea that every MMO should have).  The game's item shop (the C-store) has a little bonus content, but most of the shop items are quality-of-life benefits.That being said, the archetype system is a little confining (and allegedly more thematic than functional, according to at least a few Gold members I've talked to) and the true freeform development is only available to those who pay a monthly fee (the Gold members).I'd say plunk down a few bucks for a hideout and more inventory space and don't worry about any monthly subscription unless you're planning on this being the only game you play.Even then, be aware that Cryptic is unlikely to fix any further bugs with this game, even the ones that have been around for several years.  I'd argue this one is dying.",1
7318,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Wandered through about 10 rooms without seeing anything.

8293,War Thunder,2015.0,a great game if your in to this type of thing one negative is that you must really grind to unlock high level planes and tanks  and is easier with premium but is a great game overall        Would definitly recommend GREAT JOB DEVELOPERS,1
18392,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015.0,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.",1
5764,Path of Exile,2015.0,"POE is like no other dungeon crawler I've ever played. The passive tree and skill gems are such unique character building mechanics that they became my favorite part of the game. The currency system has been excellently designed too; each unit of value is not only  valuable because it is money but because currency itself is expendable for varying magical effects on your items, transportation etc. The graphics are beautiful and controls are easy to pick up/remappable.  Some monsters, especially dungeon bosses can be very challenging (not to mention on higher difficulties - Cruel, Merciless) and take multiple tries to beat. The game lets you spawn back into the dungeon with damage you've already dealt persisting on the bosses so eventually you can brute force it if that's what you want to do, unless you are on Hardcore, in which case - Permadeath. Home building is mainly a neat distraction and hub for the Masters you can use to more easily craft powerful gear. My only complaint is that progressing through the whole life of a character to the end game requires that you do the same quest/storyline several times in a sort of new game plus style. The storyline is not bad by any means, in fact the world lore and theme is pretty cool but it can start to get repetitive. One of the best things about it, I've never spent a single dime and I get the same gameplay that anyone else who spends money on it does, because the majority of purchases available, other than more stash room (not necessary they give you plenty) are cosmetic only.Highly highly recommend to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers, and to anyone who hasn't tried one before, why not give it a shot? Free-2-Play after all.",1
360,theHunter Classic,2016.0,i love this game i think how its so simple and so complex at the same time makes it so cool and its just fun to rome around for ages at a time its just an all round cool game i dont know how people dont like unless they dont like the fact about hunter which is undersandable but still i love this game and you should play it if you like the fact about hunting.go off and play it :),1
2701,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2018.0,"I'm not too sure what all the fuss is about with the new client. I actually like the graphical overhaul. I will bare in mind that I did take a break from this game and probably missed when it was a mess, but I do like the new look. Proper game, as well; beats Hearthstone and any other game similar to it by a high percentage.",1
13867,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2014.0,"As a simracing beginner I have to say that I like this title. The feeling of the car is very good and the sound is just awesome. I can not describe how good and realistic it is. The apex hunt feature has helped me as a beginner to reduce my lap times and learn the tracks and breaking points. Ok there are some negative points aswell, such as missing night/day features, weather and multiplayer. Another negative point is that if you want all of the content such as tracks, cars and liveries, you better start saving up some money because it is very expensive. The overall image is good I think but not perfect. It is a developing product so it is improved with every update and the fact that it is more or less free to play ( you can drive 2 cars on one track and participate in challenges) should encourage everyone to at least try it out. I would highly suggest it for those who are simracing beginners or for those who want to see if they like simracing or not.",1
18331,Elsword,2015.0,"-insert animu fanboy gushing here- It's a good game. I like the RPG elements, the item systems, the multiplayer capabilities, and the overall designs in the game. I reccommend this to anyone who wants to play a good MMO RPG.",1
1029,Brawlhalla,2016.0,Early Access ReviewIt's smash but on pc and you have to buy the champs you want. That can get annoying when a champ you like a lot you can't play at the start but that makes it so you can really say you've played every champ.,1
20342,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"  I have around 80 hours in the game. Not nearly as many as others, but I figured I'd give the POV of someone that has never played the first Planetside, and was intrigued in playing the second.  First off, the developer of the game is superb, they care about their playerbase, they listen to feedback, and they improve/balance things on a biweekly basis. They recently had a huge optimization patch, and I can say that I noticed significant improvements to the game.  Gameplay is apart of the game that I'm not TOO particularly fond of, but it can be fun if you find a group of people to play with. Solo play in a massive shooter like this won't be very rewarding unless you find a sweet spawn camping spot, or somewhere that people aren't hawking over to every 10 seconds. I've found that with a group, I have a more enjoyable time because I can get revived by friends, and they can cover my back. While playing alone, I have to watch my own back, and sometimes random players that are playing as a Combat Medic won't revive you for some reason.  User Interface is always something I have to touch on, as I'm a UI Designer myself. For Planetside 2, I feel they've done a great job refining the UI from what it was around beta/release. The attachment and certification system is much better than the original implementation, and you can easily navigate through the UI to find what you're looking for. Each of the icons on the bottom of the menu screen are precise in what they do so you're never fiddling around to figure out how to look at your weapons, or view character progression, or check out the Station Store.  Each faction have different weapons that can be fully customized, and have completely different high quality sounds. The weapons between each faction have different balances such as faster firing rate, but less power, or more power and less ammunition. Faction vehicles are also vastly different, attributes that come into effect like speed, firing rate, rocket types, etc. All weapons and vehicles also have different camoflage colors you can apply. Unique sounds for all weapons and vehicles in the game really adds to the immersion of being apart of the faction. If you're Vanu Soverign, your weapon is going to shoot little awesome laser beams, that's for sure.   One thing that I feel is really lacking in the game is the sense of community. Unless you're in a HUGE zerg squad, you don't hear much communication over the VOIP, and not many people talk in the chat. (Mattherson Server - NC) The community seems to really stick to their clans, and doesn't really venture out to new players. If you have questions, you might have to check the forums - and even then if you post a question that was already answered, you're in for some deep♥♥♥♥♥♥   There are a lot of other aspects of the game that are great such as weapon & vehicle customizations, instant action deployment, resource system, etc.Scores----------------Gunplay: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Monetization: 6/10User Interface: 9/10Customization: 9/10Sound Design: 10/10Community: 5/10 ",1
7325,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewLoved this game for years. Recent updates have made it unplayable. What's the point of a game that touts the ideals of building creatively when you have to grind or literally gamble to build in the first place? The Epic Loot update has made this game lose any chance of myself spending any more money, let alone any more time on this crap. I feel there's nothing left to say. My hundreds of hours of playtime, along with many other with as much if not more leaving similar reviews tells the story enough.",0

6061,Champions Online,2013.0,"Sit on a cactus. You feel that? Believe it or not what you just did is more fun (and less painful) than playing Champions Online.After my beloved City of Heroes got shut down I decided to try this thing. Played it for a solid month and got bored before that month was up. It has the most tedious combat of any MMO I have ever played. All attacks auto hit, no real strategy to speak of. Just stand and button mash. In CoH you could strategize by enhancing powers with damage, accuracy, range etc. There was the chance attacks would miss. You had to be careful what to use and when. Here it's just pew, pew, pew mindlessly.I wanted a telekinetic character. It's bloody annoying to throw one single object. Click the object, click to lift, click on target, click to throw! Click, click, click, click for one attack that won't even one shot an even level trash mob! The mechanics of this game are boring and a chore.Most content is stuck behind the pay wall. Problem is that unlike DC Universe Online (where a sub can be worth it) you'd just be paying for a boring game rather than playing a boring game for free. I've no idea what the Marvel MMO is like but if you want to be a hero play DC Universe Online or simply mourn COX's demise.The only one tiny good thing about this game is the sheer choice of travel powers. Not worth it. Sod the cactus, stick a fork in your eye. Still less painful than Champions Online.",0

Aura Kingdom gameplay is even better than tis and that game had bad game mechanics. Comparing it to true action MMO's like Tera and Black Dessert, Bless Online can't hold a candle against those.Like Guildwars 2 downgraded and re-skinned with uglier graphics for a 2018 game (Tis game still runs on dx9). The optimization issues are not that bad, neglible at most And the log-in issues had been somewhat fixed to a degree that you won't be bothered too much. Do yourself a favour.

8492,Fishing Planet,2018.0,"This game overall is actually really fuqing fun. The game is surprisingly realistic, graphics are pretty good for a free to play game and for what it is, it's pretty impressive they got this from the unity engine. Great game overall to play by yourself with friends or online. You can also play in tournaments and get prizes. Fishing wise it's almost all here.  The biggest downside is the shop it's absurdly expensive and also to travel to different lakes and areas is also extremely expensive. I personally think it should just be a one-time purchase and you can now go to that area unlimited amount of times. I get the developers have to make money, but honestly the online shop is still way to damn expansive.  Overall even if you don’t like fishing this game is worth a try.

1743,WARMODE,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWhat a great game, but I feel as if it is incomplete. Us fans were told about hurricane gameplay and several modes. All we get in the end is a 6-map, linear shooter with a limited user interface. It seems as if mid-development, the creators of the game said, ""Nah, it's good enough."" and left. Which sucks because it a really fun and addicting game. I would say it's a 6/10 rating, but only if you can get past the limited graphics, and limited user interface. Great game, but can be improved.",1

I personally don't mind it.Overall, I would definitely recommend this game (especially to people who like old school mmorpgs). It has its negatives, but it's a hell of a lot better than most other new mmos out there.",1

342,WARMODE,2017.0,"Early Access Review  Title WARMODE   Developer WARTEAM   Publisher WARTEAM  Release 25 August 2015  Graphics 3D   Genre FPS  Price Free-to-play  Rating 5/10 The game.WARMODE is a FPS about the confrontation of two sides, represented by the government military and the armed hirelings.Gameplay.An interesting game, still in early-alpha. Can be more than this or just stagnant here. Personally, I don't believe that can be more than this. There are some aspects that make the game be banal, like as weapon balance, some (or maybe the majority) weapons don't have no recoil, and the damage taken or induced is very weird. Btw, I played in a map much imitated of the Dust 2 of the Counter-Strike. I don't know the name but the map have very similar details. I don't like imitations.One more thing, if you have any first-person-shooter game experience, you'll literally be the best player on here and there is a great possibility of being called a hacker. One ranked as gold in CS GO can be a global here in just 20 minutes (lol). I got that feeling. Or in WARMODE just have low skill players.The game isn't bad but there are really betters on Steam. Some aspects like lag need to be fixed, servers are unstable. And please, don't compare CS GO to WARMODE, it only reveals ignorance. Counter-Strike has many years, already suffered so many changes and for sure is better, incomparable, WARMODE is an early-alpha game. The game is free, soft and with a simple interface, you need to consider these aspects too before give a negative review just because yes. I'll give a chance and I'll come back later.Positive points. (+)Free-to-play.Simple and fun interface.The devs read the reviews.Negative points. (-)Majority of the weapons don't have no recoil.The damage taken or induced is very weird.Could have more mods and maps.Need to fix some servers with lag. ",1
18079,War Thunder,2017.0,"Good game.Yeah, for some points it IS historical, even if some vehicles characteristics got slightly changed to make it more playable.I personally think that the so called ""Russian Bias"" is actually not so much intense.There are a lot of tacticts to master (BnZ, Turnfight, Energry Fight etch..) and vehicles to unlock.It is NOT pay2win as the ""Premium Vehicles"" are simply special ones that give you more XP and money, but are still easy to kill as every other of the game.On Steam i played it 949 hours, but since i also played it before they put it on Steam, i think that my hours ingame are a thing like 1500+, it never tiered me if not for small periods of time like a week max.I ABSOLUTELY reccomend this title.The Graphic is good, the only critique i can move is that the game heavily suffer of aliasing.The engien is very optimized, so even a broken toaster could run the game at the low settings with a really decent framerate.Another small critique i can do is that usually the ingame events are really, really hard, so many good unlockables are basically impossible to obtain.But apart that, it's a really good title worth to be tried at least once.

19707,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"Been playing this game since 2010, i've met some interesting and awsome people on this FPS game on some community servers. The 9 classes are psychotic mercs but in a good way and have some interesting stories to them from SFM videos and the TF2 comics. The many different weapons makes for good changes in pace and strats, and, of course, cosmetics. It gives you many different loadouts and play styles. You could even add mods for more playability. There are micro transactions but you only need to buy from the mann co store if you need to be premium otherwise you can save up metal and stock refined metal to trade or buy items at a cheaper price on the Steam Community market.But I enjoy the community servers and different game modes Payload, Payload Race, SD Doomsday, Pass time, Versus Saxton hale, Randomizer, x10, CTF, koth, Control Point, mann vs machine, surf, trade servers, mann power, Halloween mode maps, and much more. And don't forget now there is competitive and casual play as well, if your interested.There is a skill ceiling in this game that keeps you practicing on specific classes you play as and has a steep learning curb with teqniques like stair stabs, surfing, and rocket/sticky/sentry jumping.Although many people say this game is dead or down right terrible I disagree. Sure it has some problems but it has a very good Community with big events like Tip of the Hats. As i said before the TF2 characters are more interesting and have a very crazy but also lovable personality and they interact with each other in game.",1
16007,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"Tried the game, seems to be at least as good as other Hearthstone clones.Like comon $19.99 for adventure and huge disparity between spenders and f2p players due to the amount of stuff you get from ""special offers"" if you buy them. Stay away from this game if you don't want to spend money. Business model seems less greedy if you compare it with HS, MtG, or YGO, but who cares about them when there is a much more generous ccg on the market.If you are willing to invest like $50 then this game would be good, but I bet they'll get more greedy in the future once the game gets bigger, just like HS all over again. I admit that it is very tempting to spend on starter pack, but that itself, is why I would stay away from this game.I'd rather play Shadowverse, which has 10x better business model than this typical money sucking card game. I spend $0 and have completed every single meta deck in every meta cycle over there. That's my expectation for any free card game right now, the ability to play every good meta decks without spending a single cent while only playing nothing more than daily quest everyday (no grinding).tl;dr;- more p2w than SV- more RNG dependant than SV (prophecy rng wtf)- less players than SV- too much paying player advantage- single player content that needs to be bought, ala HS- much better game than Hearthstone in every aspect, but far less players",0

4375,SMITE®,2015.0,"I have never really written a review for any game on steam, but this game breaks that mold, in fact it breaks lots of molds in the MOBA genre in all. Its a MOBA game that uses a third person camera at all times, while this may seem like a quirky gimmic that makes the game uninteresting in a few moments of gameplay it does not. It always keeps my attention and I waste hours playing this game without even realising it and thats the thing. Whenever I try to play any other MOBA game (Dota 2/League of Legends) I get bored quickly because I feel like the action just isnt there. This game on the contrary is always filled with excitment and im always on my toes when I play this game. All of the Basic attacks are whats called ""skill shots"" meaning you have to aim in order to kill anyone in this game. Unlike other MOBA games you do not click on the ground to move, instead you move with the WASD keys and you have to option to re bind them to something else. Currently the game has about 69 Gods to play as from different pantheons. Gods are essentially your character that you can choose to play as or a ""Champion"" if you will and they all look and sound Great! Hell the entire game looks amazing even when everything was turned down on low! The game modes vary from conquest (5V5) to Joust (3V3) and if that isnt enough you have a MOTD or a ""mode of the day"" which should add a little something to your life if you ever get bored of Classic 5V5. A MOTD is a random mode with the rules changed whether it be Extra money or all one character or a mode where everyone is already to the max level. In the end I could keep going about how amazing this game is ( I have played this for like a gazillion hours before it even came to steam) Or I could just end on saying, if you want to try a MOBA game thats a little diffrent but still fun Smite is your game!",1

No more having to kill my phone battery to hours-on-end grinding up the ladder in ranked! Now.. if I could just get that damn UR I need out of the box.For real, though. This is a really good mobile port and they made great use of the space available. This game is quite addictive and I recommend it to any Yu-Gi-Oh! fan on steam. You can buy ""packs"" with real cash if you very well wish to, however, it is completely optional and it's very easy to acquire the in-game currency to buy said packs without putting any money into this game!",1
2399,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewBetter version of PUBG, and also ""free"". There are obviously microtransactions, some of which are a little intrusive. For example, there are weekly challenges that give you an EXP bonus if you complete 4 out of 7. The catch is that only 3 of them are available unless you buy the Adventurer Pass (about $13CAD)That aside, the traversal is pretty cool, being able to choose from a glider, snowboard and a climbing pack (which is terribly slow for climbing, but is the only loadout that allows you to use the ziplines). Everyone starts with a gun, a pistol for glider and snowboard, and a double-barrel shotgun for the climber. The games are usually only around 60 players at the start, and combine that with the abundance of loot, the game moves a lot faster than other BR's.If you even slightly enjoy Battle Royale games, I would strongly suggest this one. I personally like it more than any other I've played.",1

9620,Creativerse,2017.0,"If you are a fan of Minecraft and all the features that make it good, this game will disappoint you.The major issues with this game are:1) The developers have an ego, they don't actually listen to the community (despite the lies that PR spouts), and are patronizing to the community, while claiming to listen to them.2) There are no option for texture packs, mods, single player, or creative mode (the most demanded features by the community || see #1) . None of the features would be hard to do and keep it ""Free"" either.3) It's very sub-par on the survival side of things. It's generally too easy to get to top tier equipment, and there's not very much equipment to get in the first place. Farming is slow and awful. This is where modding would help, but Playful treats the topic like it's heresy.4) The exploration is very underwhelming. After about an hour, it becomes a recurring theme of ""Oh, Iv'e seen this before"". There are no villages, no dungeons, no monuments, no random buildings, limited biome variety, limited mob variety etc.5) It's a bit expensive. ""Oh, but it's free to play"" according to PR. Well technically yes, but like it or not, the game has achieved pay-to-win status. Sure, none of the core features are locked behind a pay wall, but literally ALL additional textures, and the coolest equipment absolutely IS locked behind a pay wall. Heck, there have been ENTIRE updates that had most of the content locked behind a pay wall. Want the good stuff? Expect to pay $70 for this game.6) It deserves to be repeated, the devs DO NOT care about the community. When they claim to ""listen"", what they mean is that they cherry pick the request they like and implement them, then giving themselves glorious fanfare on blogs and social media to the tune of ""look how much we listen!""",0
4084,theHunter Classic,2015.0,"Love this game, the only reason so m any people hate it is because it says free to play and it isn't. I would urge the makers of the game to remove its free to play status and just be honest. It is limited for free to play and it's mostly a pay to play game. With that being said, I'll continue with why I love the game.It is an EXCELLENT pay to play game and literally the only online game I have subscribed to aside from World Of Warcraft when I was younger. Me, my buddy and my girlfreind spend hours at a time stalking and killing Elk with the amazing tracking system and the detailed injury system, allowing you to see exactly what organs you've hit on the animal after you collect the kill. This helps you to make a more precise and fast kill the next time, eventually leading you from shooting wildly at the animal and tracking it forever, to shooting the animal exactly where it's vital organs are, killing it in one swift killshot. This get's even better when you use weapons that are silent like bows or crossbows, enabling you to kil animals quick and silently without alerting others in the heard they are travelling with. I've taken doiwn 4 or 5 animals in one silent swipe with my buddy before, making tandem kills and picking the off animals lagging behind the rest of the heard.I also enjoy that there are many different ways to earn the in game real money currency ""em$"". Aside from spending your cash on it, you can also earn it by completing competitions, which with a free memebrship can be very difficult, but with just the basic package, it allows you to kill nearly all the animals (with the exception of a few that require specific equipment) and take part in most competition with at least some chance to achieve victory if you are really dedicated enough. You can also earn ""em$"" by completeing simple tasks such as filling out surveys, downloading apps onto your phone (tha can be immediatly removed) or registering to a website and confirming an E-mail. I've earned well ove 10,000 em$ through this process and although I have spent real money on the game, if I really wanted to, I could just keep completeing these tasks to earn whatever guns or equipment I wanted.Finally I'll talk about the dev team. With regular updates, bug fixes and new features being added to the game, it really feels like you're paying into the development of the game. New areas, new animals to hunt and just recently the addition of hunting dogs, really lets you know that the dev team is working hard to bring you new and exciting features for the game.Many people are turned off by the amount of money that can be dropped on the game, and I can see where the concern comes from, but this is one of the best hunting games I've ever played and although I hope they change their pricing model some day, I'm willing to pay for the amazing features in this game right now, given the quality of it.Edit: Also I should mention that the price of being able to hunt all animals is very low (in my opinion anyway). The first 3 month will cost you $5.66 a month and give you a pump shotgun which will allow you to hunt literallly every animal in the game. If you feel like doing missions until you can buy the single shot shotgun with the unpaid currency (Gm$) than you could pay for a 3 month membership for $3.66 a month and be able to hunt every single animal in the game. Since it gives you unlimited ammo you can hunt as much as you want during that time and it wont be a problem. Keep in mind that you can win competitions to get the paid currency, but they can be quite difficult to rank in. Also, people seem to have a problem with the amount of game hours I have in the game so I'll explain why I have so many. If you leave the initial ""thehunter"" browser open, steam counts you as in game and thus you get a billion hours in a week if you leave it open. I leave my browser open nearly all the time since me my buddies and my gf play so often, and so I can get the latest news they have updated the game with. So if you think it's sketchy that I have so many hours in the game, it's literallyn just because I leave the main browser open.",1
883,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAlthough this would be a very cool game, do not play it because the amount of pay to play is ridiculous. You literally cannot progress without paying. it's also an extremely expensive pay to play at that. 2/10 do not play",0

1350,Paladins®,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewA game truly with a lot of potential.  I've put a decent amount of hours into the game and was able to see just how competitive the game can be when played at a higher elo. A lot of people are unhappy with the newest version changing the card system.  I can agree that this change is bad, but not nearly the worst part about this game.  If you like being screamed, having a teamate go afk, or called every name you can think of as soon as a game starts if someoone doesn't like your champion choice or as soon as something goes wrong this is the game for you.  There are a lot of good people in the community, but the amount of toxic players puts games like overwatch (who has gotten a lot of media attention lately about its toxic community) to shame.  This brings me to my next point that this is not an overwatch clone as a lot would point out.  The gameplay is so much different that the two can't even be compared in my opinion.  It's a game that has potential and could be really great, but until they start dealing with the community behavior there's other places worth spending your time.",0
15815,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is an enjoyable CCG that combines the best card playing elements of Magic: The Gathering with the online automation of Hearthstone. It has just enough differences to be refreshing in its own right. The artwork assets are very good, but not quite up to Blizzard levels. However, most of the artwork, animation and sound is very cool and effective. There are more single player activities than in Hearthstone. The makers of the game supply a generous amount of card packs and coins for playing parts of the game like daily quests, puzzles and tutorials. At the moment, you get a free pre-made deck to keep every 3 days, with a daily quest to accompany it. Multiplayer is standard fare, mostly comparable to Hearthstone. Crafting cards is comparable to Hearthstone also. The game mat is updated with totems on the sides relating mostly to the color of the power sigils used. The micro-transactions are not really necessary if you play the game a lot. Your gameplay activity is synced between your PC/Mac, tablet and smartphone. This is a very fun game that will appeal to online CCG fans.",1
10263,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"I've played this game for a couple years now, and have stuck by it's side through thick and thin. I've seen multiple update rages, many update praises, and so much more. That doesn't even begin to explain the time I've had playing the game though. TF2 has so many amazing things you can do and even specialize in. You can pick from 9 classes, and several different weapon combinations within those classes to perfect your own playstyle. Technically speaking, the game isn't limited to 9 classes either. Slap a sword and shield on your Demoman and you get a Demoknight, a completely different playstyle from the bomb lobbing drunk scottish man. Slap a gunslinger and a few good weapons on the Engineer and you get the Combat Engineer, a more aggressive member of the team who (when played right) can actually help more than you think. There's so much more to the game than just a simple shooter, with community servers running custom gamemodes that you wouldn't even expect to be in a game like this. While not all are fun, give them a try, you may like them. The community has its ups and downs, but most communities have those. Occasionally you will find a really toxic player, which can ruin the moods of many people, or someone really salty, or a troll, but don't let them get to you. Try to be the good in the community, and maybe things will change. Me? I'll admit, I can be quite toxic and salty A LOT of the time, but I try to be good where it counts. You've got hundreds, even thousands of game groups all specializing in certain things in TF2, whether it be your favorite gamemode or a group dedicated to Rocket Jumping, there's almost everything you could want from it.Updates: a very controversial subject (especially recently with the Meet Your Match update) I will admit when MYM first came out, I was part of the angry torch toting crowd bent on destroying Valve, but they very quickly noticed that the community was not taking too kindly to the update, and made some announcements and changes. Valve doesn't always listen, but when they do, they do a good job of it. They've tried at least a LITTLE to fix the problem, atleast give them credit for that. Give them time, I'm sure we'll all come back to it eventually, and Valve will get stuff fixed up.There's A LOT and I really do mean A LOT of things I haven't explained here in TF2, you just gotta play it and find them for yourself. Whether or not you enjoy the game isn't up to me, and I wouldn't feel any different if you hated it, I'm not going to shove it down your throat (Okay... Maybe a little.)Edit : The Pyro Update/Jungle Inferno changed the game up quite a bit, which unsurprisingly sparked quite a bit of anger from people in the community. I was angry with the update at first but as things started to calm down a bit it started to feel like normal again. Even if an update is good or bad, give it some time and think rationally about the changes that are happening. Change is something people dislike so it comes as no surprise that when change happened people got mad. Give the game some time and focus more on the core of it all and I'm sure it will stay enjoyable.Edit 2 : Updates are few and far between, so don't expect many to happen. They DO happen, just not often. The community (Atleast most of it I think) has come to terms with the lack of updates and is kind of use to it at this point. An update is more a nice surprise than it is a cool new feature or something at this point.TL;DRPlay the game, don't get mad, lots of features, don't be toxic, more than displayed.Try to enjoy games, no matter what situation you are in. People can be crappy, just get through it and don't and fuel to the flames.",1

Then shadow towers got introduced to the game and it was fun to battle to Titan bosses. I would always be one of the last players standing with my end-game Dracolyte.Then it all changed, the game I once knew and loved vanished. It became a grinding game where the P2W players would most of the time have the upper hand.

9217,War Thunder,2018.0,"War Thunder was a game I enjoyed for many years, I made many friends playing this game and had great times. But these past couple years the game has been deteriorating rapidly, Gaijin has been neglecting what the community wants and needs. They have been implementing more and more premium vehicles into the game (which I am not necessarily against) but by doing so they have been letting new players get to the higher tiers, they have gone against their old saying of not letting people buy in to tier 5 instead of earning it. Worst of all, Gaijin has recently mocked their own community with the FPE & Parts debacle. Gaijin has consistently failed to mend damage with the community, and instead are seeking profits rather than a healthy game. While I do understand that the whole business is to make money, it is sad to see a game that the company once seemed they loved and had passion for is now another money making sham. If you want to play this game, go ahead, I imagine you will enjoy tier 1 and 2 but it is not worth putting your money in to, it is not worth putting a lot of energy and love in to.",0

3246,Robocraft,2015.0,"This is my first negative review for a game ever, and it hurts me to do so on this game but the dissapointment is too much - FREEJAM... What a shame - PLEASE fix your terrible new tiering system out, you completely killed robocraft with it. Until then, I have very little motivation to play. I have played with friends since first release, LOVED IT. Got over T10+, stopped for a while and we said to each other that ""we can't wait to play it in a while and see it grow and mature""... 1 year later, we try it again updated, excited to show additional friends too... but wait, it's not Robocraft anymore - it's truly Robocrap. The spirit of classically, easily and understandably levelling up (to all types of end-users) has died... you could even say this pretty much isn't even a proper objective-based level-up game anymore, now it's just some weird kind of open-world-free-for-all-matchmaking-CHAOS that is really frustrating and just doesn't make sense.Robocraft is now literally a sinking ship - soon on it's way to 'Mixed' reviews on Steam. This game could have been a timeless classic, and it still can be. Would love to delete this review and leave a recommended one, make it happen. I'll be watching carefully, and honestly if it's not fixed soon I'll be very sad to see this once-a-great-game be uninstalled from my library.*EDIT/UPDATE 1* - For people who say I'm hating, I'm not, I still love the game and I'm actually still playing it, if you haven't played the game since it's initial release you won't understand. Trust me, if you played the pre-updated versions you would say, “why did they ever change it?!” ... I just cannot recommend Robocraft anymore - yes it WAS a fantastic game, but anyone can make any robot now and the matchmaking will 90% of the time put you in an extremely unfair game - the tiering system is completely messed up making the whole aim of the game pointless... the achingly painful feeling of spending hours on building an awesome robot only to find it is put into games with MUCH more powerful robots is depressing, confusing and just pure torture :(*EDIT/UPDATE 2* (29/09/2015) - I was just playing Robocraft all last night, woke up this morning and wow... just WOW - FREEJAM what are you guys even doing?! A few days ago I made this review and it made it to the steam store page and I hoped maybe you guys would feel my outrage, but nope, you go and add even more ridiculous updates. In the last update you made it so that only high level robots can do TDM, a week later, without any word of warning again, without letting the community know what your doing you switch the whole thing around for a week? and your excuse is, ""so we can make more games available for everyone""... :| :| :| LOL HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?! At least come up with better excuses. Seriously, let us know more about what your doing and working on, you should be serving your consumers, making votes and poll's, making us feel part of the development, instead you don't listen to suggestions and complaints and you act like Gods who use their consumers as lab rats. I'm not even playing this week because of today's update. You know, I didn't even know who you guys were until your over-tampering with the game, your presence in the game makes me feel nauseous and I had to find out who was causing it, how sad is that? I should be searching you guys up because of how awesome you guys are as developers, and yes you guys were good initally, but your test of integrity failed badly. How can you not see your ruining the game? It's like you guys sweat on your monitors so much that you can't see your screens anymore. Take a break, have a shower and clean it all up.Sorry if I seem harsh xD I'm just ranting on, BUT STILL, the truth is always harsh. :) Anyway just remember I'm willing to forgive and forget and venerate you guys as one of the best indie game developers ever for making the awesome game that is Robocraft if you just sort out all these unnecessary updates, kthnxbye :D (Y)*EDIT/UPDATE 2* (02/04/2018) - I just realised I predicted years ago that Robocraft would go down to ""Mixed reviews"" status on Steam and I checked back today and it is a solid Mixed. I installed the game again to see if there were any improvements and oh... my.... there are no words to desribe how bad and messed up the game has become. I've never seen any other game become this ruined before! I would predict that this game would go to ""Mostly negative"" however all the current players probably never played the original Robocraft.

2493,Robocraft,2018.0,"This game plain and simple betrayed my trust. What do i mean by that? I picked up robocraft a while ago, back in the days before there were walking mechs, when there was a tech tree and i coudl feel myself progressing in the game. I spent real money to gain access to a part i wanted to use, and gain access to one of the premium robos that came with that purchase, again this was way back in the day, When it was all about building and protecting your captains chair, making something unique that worked, I had made myself a hovering ship in the same style as the floating ships in a mario game. THEN The Devs had an update. Not only did the update remove all of my progress thusfar, it removed my robos and my premium ship that i paid real money to have and have access to, I lost everythign when it updated but i decided to give it another chance and rebuild from the ground up. This was the begining of a slippery slope of removal of progress, updates that drastically altered the game. and finally, the death of what i thought was a unique and wonderful experience. I played world of tanks for a long time, about two years total before i picked up robocraft, and the game felt more rewarding and interesting than both World of Tanks and Warthunder, despite being in the same genre of game. Now the game is a husk of the creativity and interesting gameplay. If you wanted to pick up robocraft now. I couldn't reccomend it if you payed me. It doesn't feel like you are making progress. It doesn't feel like you can be successful with your own creation. ANd worst of all. It doesn't feel fun.If the devs ever decide to make a seperate game that is more of the classic robocraft I would love to play it, even pay for the experience of that again. This game isn't gonna go out with a bang, or with a graceful defeat in the likes of paragon. The game will wither. and that is a crime",0
1007,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI only downloaded this game because it was a BR with 'classes' - it added flavor to, imo, a very bland genre. Well, the classes have been removed and replaced with 'runes'. So instead of trying to balance the classes they decided to just make OP RNG based. Good job HI-REZ. You killed this just like you killed 'Hand of the Gods'.",0
12032,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"Frankly, you'd have to be in a coma to not want to try the game, seeing as it's totally free of charge. Regardless of your first impressions from reviews, give it a whirl!As you probably already know, Planetside 2 is all about fighting in huge battles with dozens (or hundreds) of players simultaneously in a persistent world composed of three/four 'continents' which are roughly 8 x 8 KM large; Indar (Semiarid desert), Esamir (Frozen tundra) Amerish (Lush mountain range) and in the coming summer, Hossin (Overgrown swamp). You can take control of a soldier from the totalitarian Terran Republic (TR), who rely heavily on conventional weapons with high rates of fire and quick vehicles covered with a red/black color scheme. In addition, there are the New Conglomerate (NC) freedom fighters who rely on high-recoil gauss weapons and slower-moving gameplay, all saturated with blue/gold paint. Then there is the Vanu Sovereignty (VS), who have purple and teal alien energy weapons and a variety of special traits over the other two. The battles the three factions fight across the continents are a ton of fun, with the largest battles claiming the lives of dozens of players in a few seconds, with the battles themselves lasting hours or, rarely, days. The game's lighting (which is UNBELIEVABLY good; take a look at the night sky when players are shooting flak at aircraft) makes the fights visually spectactular, with huge explosions and tracer rounds making even smaller fights hard to miss. The sounds are also extremely good, with the thundering of war and explosions, with the 'whirr' of bullets flying past your head providing unmatched immersion in an FPS.The game has five basic infantry classes; the Combat Medic, who does what you think he does. The Engineer, who sets up turrets, supplies ammo and repairs things. Infiltrators, who can hack enemy terminals and equipment, lay mines, and cloak. Heavy Assaults, who blow up fortifications and vehicles with HMG's and rocket launchers and have resist shields. Finally, there is the Light Assault, who has a jetpack and annoys people. In addition to the above, there is also a set of powered battle armour called the 'MAX' suit that players can equip that enables them to trash enemies of all kinds... for a price.Those infantry can use a large selection of cross-faction and faction-specific vehicles, like the air superiority fighters, main battle tanks and IFV's, which keep the battles mobile and dangerous. They're also a lot of fun to use, for obvious reasons (Ever run over a 20-strong platoon of soldiers in a tank? I have)Not everything is peachy, however, though nothing is 'bad':The size of the game and other technical hurdles leaves it unable to support higher-quality textures on-par with today's gold-standard, with its graphics being roughly equivalent to 2011's 'best', although the art style offsets this somewhat.The game's historically poor performance and optimization has been more-or-less fixed, but the game is still somewhat taxing on older computers. If your rig is older than, say, three years, you'll have to fiddle with some settings.There are some balancing issues with faction-specific vehicles and weapons, but most are relatively minor and the few that aren't (weren't) have been patched.The current 'metagame' (i.e. a sense of accomplishment and permanence to your actions) is rather lacking at the moment, with the continents swinging wildly from 90% VS control, to 80% NC, to 70% TR... Very little territory in the game stays with your faction for more than a few days. This should be fixed when Hossin is released, when they will release 'continent lattices' which will enable teams to totally conquer the game world.'Certifications', the in-game currency you earn by getting experience points, are somewhat slow to accumulate, so if you're planning on getting good gear several hours of gameplay is the minimum requirement. You also cannot purchase in-game cosmetic items with certs, you must buy them with real money.Other, even more minor things are present, but none, not even the ones I described, are really a hinderance by any stretch. The game is an absolute joy to play, even if you don't put any money into it, and it offers an expeience you can't get anywhere else. I award this game a great 8/10; a definite download for fans of the FPS genre.:D ",1
11301,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2017.0,"It's a pretty good game/program, but the pay-to-play business model sucks. It's free to download now, but I coughed up some actual currency months ago and have very little access to the content. You can spend days and days of your time unlocking the guns you actually want to see, or you can give them more money. I wouldn't pay more than 10 bucks for a fully unlocked game. Personally, I would prefer to pay the 10 bucks and then progress through an unlocking system that's much more friendly, and not intended to annoy you in to paying more money.",0

4462,SMITE®,2017.0,"Free to play game and not pay to win! I grinded to unlock all gods without spending money. If you want to test out a god's abilities, you can try any god in jungle practice. You can normally play any god you want even as a new player through renting with favor, a currency earned simply by playing the game. You can rent a god for 24 hours with 300 favor, which really is not much. The only thing you can really pay for other than gods is cosmetics. I find the game very enjoyable most of the time, but there are several issues with it.Matchmaking is bad. The ranked divisions are Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, and Grandmaster. I am a Grandmaster 1v1 player (top 25) and it is not uncommon to face players in the Platinum division, which is 3 divisions below me. On top of this, for some reason the game will reward me more Tribute Points (earning TP increases your rank) for beating lower ranked players than higher ranked players. I also lose less TP for losing to lower ranked players, and more for losing to higher ranked players. This is the opposite of what it is supposed to happen.Playerbase seems very toxic. Every 1v1 match I play, I enter Do Not Disturb and mute my opponent so they cannot interact with me in any way. The amount of toxic people playing the game is hard to believe and kind of upsetting. It does not matter if you are playing the lowest level or the highest level. Even most streamers BM their teammates. In casual matches it is not uncommon for me to mute 2-3 teammates, while I almost always have to mute at least 1. Chances are if someone is not BMing, they aren't saying much of anything or you are winning and they are not dying. Just remember there is a mute button, and if you find someone that seems cool, try to add them and play with them. If they turn out to be toxic, don't feel like you can't delete them.Balance is okayish. Gods are often overpowered on release or, with Ullr recently, buffed far too much when they have a big expensive skin coming out. I think the balance team often makes questionable decisions but nothing that makes the game unplayable to me.These are the main issues I can think of with the game, but it is not nearly enough to stop me from playing it. I've met some great people playing Smite, including my SO, The gameplay is very enjoyable, especially some of the challenges I face in 1v1s. I don't think bugs are as big of an issue or as common as some people may make them out to be. Give it a try! We need more players. Just remember the mute button and don't get discouraged if bad MM puts you against someone with 1000+ hours lol.",1

1256,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWriting reviews isn't really my thing, but I will make an exception for Eternal. Most people will look at it and think Hearthstone, but it's closest kin is really Magic the Gathering. I say that, but there's some major design changes from the MTG format - often things that will take advantage of the digital format, such as permanently altering the stats and abilities of cards even when they change zones (Battlefield to graveyard, etc.Regardless, what most of you will want to know is how hard is it to get into the game? Well let me just say it's about the most generous card game I've played. You earn at least one pack every day, you earn gold fairly quickly every day (enough to grind out a draft), draft modes let you keep every card you pick, the game gives away packs like hotcakes early on, and finally you can always get free drops (cards, packs, draft tickets) from watching streams (which happens to be a great way to learn!). If you want a good newbie friendly streamer to watch, check out LocoPojo or KaelosTheReckoning.Last but not least, there's a decent single player experience to be had as well, including several campaigns, puzzles, and a hearthstone-style draft mode vs an AI.",1

672,DCS World Steam Edition,2018.0,"I'll start with requirements. Forget requirements in description, those are for OLD client. Right now you need high-end gaming equipment to play this game smooth and nice or you'll need to run in potato mode. Somebody mentioned it earlier - multiplayer is laggy. Worst part is when you're in the middle of opperation or just taking off from airport and somebody connects to server. Allready dozen times happened that crash happened because so much lags. I don't mind AI, it's pretty decent. If you want to learn and practice use lower setting, if you're up to more challenge make the AI level higher and if you're hardcore just join some PvP multiplayer. The simulation level is marvellous. You can actually fly modern military aircraft which is mostly impossible to ever fly for most people on the earth. Lack of finish on most recently released models can be frustrating but it's a better learning curve for newbies (you don't have whole plane to learn but in part by part).

16056,War Thunder,2016.0,"Simply put: I don't have such love/hate relationship with any other game than I have with War Thunder. Also no other game has made me more salty than War Thunder.That said I'll list some pros and cons.Pros:-Different levels of realism from shooty-tooty arcade to much slower paced simulator battles-Lots of tanks and airplanes to unlock and new ones are constantly added-Very nice graphics-Free to play but not win to pay-Does actually require some skill, especially later in gameCons:-Realism is sometimes more like ""realism"", tanks ricocheting rounds in very weird way OR taking damage when they really shouldn't etc-There are lots of stuff to unlock but sometimes you'll notice that vehicles are very similiar. For example when unlocking american tanks you'll spend ages grinding through three different Shermans that aren't actually that different from each other after all. (Slight changes to armour thickness etc, don't really mean anything) And that's just one example.-Technically it's still pay to win, War Thunder has this premium system that gives you different kind of boosters to use and also provides you with a selection of premium vehicles. Not all of them are that special but some of them are seriously unbalanced and overpowered.-Does require skill but still most of the time it seems that it's not enough. Game suffers from serious balancing problems and therefore some matches end in minutes no matter how good of an player you are.Some other things that need to be noted:Game has this Battle rating system or BR in short. This means that every vehicle has a rating, for example 3.7. Game then searches for players with same BR. Thing is that usually you have more than just one vehicle. Lets say you have three tanks with BR of 3.7. Things are good and you're having pretty evenly balanced games. Then you get a tank with BR of 4.3 Suddenly you're facing tanks that have BR of 5 or even higher. This leads to greatly unbalanced game.Also because of this game doesn't always feel rewarding. For example I grinded for some time to get legendary Tiger and Panther tanks but after I got them I really didn't feel like playing with them because I was fighting more advanced (prototype or post-WW2 era tanks) most of the time. That also takes away some realism.Spawncamping. Yes, I do it sometimes myself too but still. Too often I see games where one team steamrolls to other teams spawn and kills everyone. Some maps even make it very easy by having the spawn points on open ground and easily seen from across the map. Already unbalnaced games become even more unbalnced because of this.Lack of teamwork. It's extremely rare to see some real teamwork in WT unless you're playing with friends or are part of some clan. There are lots of russian players even on EU servers and they don't usually speak english and even less usually they give a ♥♥♥♥ about other players. Not saying that they all are like that, just like 80% of them...Game modes don't really force you to be a team player. Okay maybe it's bit wrong to rant about this but I still want to point it out. With tanks game modes usually require player to capture and hold some point on the map. Even though you do get a reward for capturing a point and you do get more points and currency if you win a match it doesn't force you to play the objective or be a team player. WT would be a lot more fun with new game modes etc, maybe there will be some in the future.All in all, War Thunder is somewhat hooking even though sometimes it makes you really salty. You might like it or not or perhaps you'll be like me and feel both ways. I chose not to recommend this game because right now it feels unbalanced and broken, maybe I'll change my mind after a while. Or maybe not.  ",0
6527,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2017.0,"I love taking things apart to see how they work so for me this game has been amazing. The models are highly detailed, the controls are smooth and easy to grasp, and the range of guns to choose from keeps growing by the day. This is a fun little time-waster,  the kind of game which you log in to for maybe a few minutes each day to fiddle around in. I'm having a blast so far and would highly recommend this game",1
3335,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2018.0,"This game is one of the best i have ever played. I started playing because of nostalgia from my youth and i must say, that this game complements the old memories i have of playing ""Yu-Gi-Oh"" as a child. If you are worried that the gameplay is stale or neutered in order to balance the game between opponents, dont worry the game is exactly like it used to be but with some new and welcome amendments. If we were to discuss the graphical aspects of the game, they are insane. The idea of this game is almost 15 years old, and the developers have managed to retouch the game with new graphics without ruining the nostalgic feeling of playing. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to take a trip back in time and go back to playing games without hidden messages, DLC's or other corperate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.",1

18054,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"I came into this game knowing what it would be like since I have played it on mobile. This game is well polished. It has great sounds, animations and art. Why am I not recommending this game? It is perfect for mobile, but on the PC it just doesn't fit. This is a game that is built to check at different time intervals throughout the day. It is not something that can be actively played. I'm not able to sit down in a 1 hour session and get anything useful done since most things have immense time limits.My advice to the developers is to curate more content for the PC version. Instead of Free to Play, slap a price on it. I won't be buying in game packs simply because it's not worth it. I'll be playing other games. This is just a cash grab on the desktop.",0
2950,AdventureQuest 3D,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is the working beta of the first Unity-based Artix Entertainment game. Bright, colorful, cartoonish 3D graphics with quirky, goofball dialogue are the trademarks of this small Development Team out of Lakeland, Florida.The game is in a constant cycle of development, patches, and updates. As previously stated, this is an open beta. New content is added on a monthly basis, generally speaking. The newest update, Dragons of Ashfall, added new beasts, new dungeons, NPC characters, the beginning of a new chapter, as well as an increase in the level cap. There are several dozen hours worth of quests to experience, with more being added on a regular release schedule.The game is a straightforward MMORPG with a twist; the full game can be played on a laptop, tablet, or phone on the same servers! A friend playing on a laptop can instantly join in with a friend playing on his tablet as they fight in the same dungeons. If two players have a gap in level, the lower-level player can ""sidekick"" up to the higher level to gain experience and rewards as they fight on an even playing field. Trades, Weapon Fusion, PVP, and more features are being developed to continuously add to the full game.Goblins, Dragons, and Undead skeletons await! Battle on!",1
9731,Champions Online,2017.0,"Wow, there's some harsh critisizm hanging around from people who didn't even give the game the time of day.I've played a great many MMOs in my time and Champions is the only one I always come back to. Nothing beats the feeling of just swinging/running/flying through the city beating up bad guys and saving civillians.I orginally got into this came when I was looking for a replacement to fill the Freedom Force shaped hole in my heart and I've been playing on and off ever since.  I even survived the buyout from PWE.  The game has gone through a lot of changes and not all of them are positive, but there's still plenty of reasons to play.Some good points:>Walking through the door, you have access to create your hero's every physical aspect.  Rather than choosing between one of 8 premade faces and skin tones, you have hundreds of options available to you (And yes you have more if you choose to buy them).  On top of that you have thirty odd sliders to change the size, shape, and detail of every choice you've made.>Also walking through the door, your hero can already fly.  Or have super speed, or teleport.  You don't have to wait until you hit X level before you can get a mount.> You feel like a super hero.  You can fly, when you punch guys you can send them flying, You can have lazer eyes or breathe ice. You can be indestructable or set yourself on fire.>You can make just about any hero you can dream up. They have some set archatypes that function as pre-built 'classes' that give you a few choices but have a solid theme or power set, but the real joy is in going freeform and making your very own hero drawing from any power set you want.  You want to make a Speedster that weilds a sword and uses his friction to throw fire? Done. Do you want to be a robot ninja with a shotgun? Done. Psychic Dinosaur from Outer Space? Got you covered. Even the sky isn't the limit.>The story is very comic booky and has a self-aware sense of humor.>They are frequently releasing new comic book stories, events, costume parts, and even power sets.>The player base is friendly and supportive.  More so than any other online game I've played.  Other players are actually happy to help you or tell you how to get the cool thing they have or to talk characters.A few Bad things:>Yes, the game is F2P.  That means you 'can' play without giving them money.  No, you will not have access to all the bits and bobs and cool things as some of the other players do. However,  If you are willing to devote time to the game, you can in fact get everything that paying players can by selling in-game currencies for real money.>The graphics are a little behind what would be considered the norm at the moment. This being said, it dose make it easier to run on older computers.>The amount of front-loaded personalization can seem intimadating when starting out.  Just jump in, you'll figure it out.  And dont' be afraid to make a mess.In closing, if you don't like the Super-Hero genre, this game probably isn't for you. If makeing choices or customizing your own character sounds like too much work for you, you'd probably be happier elsewhere.  But if you do love Comic Books and are the creative sort, and spending hours on end designing, redesigning, and playing your very own superheroes sounds like your kind of a fun time, this could be one of the best games you'll ever buy... or not-buy.",1

Great graphics, some fun times, but horribly designed maps and matchmaking.Masters of the Sea update has made upteir matchmaking worse and spawncamping more prevalant.

10949,Fishing Planet,2017.0,"First off... It's a great fishing sim.  However, the currency system in the game right now makes no sense and tries at every turn to make you purchase premium.  Otherwise if you don't own DLC as I do you will probably find yourself getting frustrated.  For example I racked up 150 hours when this game first came out and made what I thought was a lot of money, just over 30k.  Come back recently and that amount of money was gone in 2 trips to florida fishing bass...  Even with a 220lb net you barely make enough to cover expenses, Can't recommend this game to new players in its current state.",0
14673,Fishing Planet,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter a day of strressful work (or stressful gaming) this an incredibly satisfying, yet relaxing casual fishing simulator.  I have not played too many fishing sims but I have played enough to find this one far more enjoyable.If you are highly competitive even in your casual gaming you will probably not find this appealing at the moment.  Multiplayer exists and the community is really great -- but there are no tournaments and you're left with a leader board for each fishing location but nothing super special.And of course if you are super competitive you will be frustrated by the DLC and micro transactions.  When approached from the perspective of a casual game, I find the micro transactions to be distateful but much less bothersome.As with most fishing sims, you are of course rewarded more for catching the ""popular kids"" of the sport fishing world (Bass, Salmon, Pike ect ect) but you are still able to progress/level with trout, catfish and panfish.  They are actually how I grabbed some decent ingame cash early on though they fade in importance over time.The graphics are enjoyable but at the moment the software is certainly not optimized.  I regularly have minor (read: non-game breaking) graphical errors.  The sound track is peaceful and enjoyable as well.  In short, if you want to actually feel like you're really fishing with complicated sporting gear in the actual environment...you need to purchase a fishing license and go out side.  But if you're interested in casually gaming and like fishing this is not a bad option and honestly one of the best currently availabe (though that says so little). ",1
7969,Shadowverse CCG,2018.0,"Highly recommended if you have ever played and liked either Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering. As a friend of mine put it, this game is essentially magic packed inside of a hearthstone shell.From my own experience, this game is the polar opposite of what can often feel a long and brutal F2P grind contained in Hearthstone. You get an INSANE amount of starting cards and you can very quickly earn a large amount of starting gold and arena runs to get you going.There is literally no reason to not try this game if you are mildly interested in CCGs. The competitive scene is funded and active.",1
8459,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"This game is a big joke.I litteraly got tears rolling down my cheeks.There is no trade system between players, the only way to give an item to someone is to use the auction... But your item takes 30 minutes to 2 hours to show up...You have to pay WHEN you store item in your bank, and WHEN you withdraw items from it (it's not much money, but still...).You got to buy your teleport scrolls (which is normal), and then you got to pay to USE them...The servers are not up to the task, it keeps lagging, it didn't even actually have been released (only founders can play it for now, and I don't think it's a big part of the upcoming population).The most of my time playing this game, I was waiting for it to load... When I got my class level 15 as a magician I had the possibility to ""evolve"", and I decided to become a pyroman. So I had to teleport to a house (LOADING), take the quest, get out of the house (LOADING), get in another house (LOADING) and kill two monsters, teleport back to the first house (LOADING) to finish the quest, and then get out of the house (LOADING) to teleport at the sanctuary (LOADING) and finally get in action (but I wasn't able to teleport to the right level of the dungeon and had to walk deeper which means MORE LOADING).And it's not even like the loadings are fast, no, they often took more than 1 minute to complete (I don't have the best computer, but I was expecting this game to have a well optimization given the look of it).There is so much more to say... Freezes, game crashing without any reason...So, I would rate this game 4/10 at most. I really wouldn't recommend you buying it. If you really want to try it, you should wait for it to release free to play next month.EDIT= I would like to apologize to my friend who will recognize himself. I shouldn't have let you offer me this game.",0

14002,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewCame with no expectations, and was still disappointed.My friends and I aren't the type of people who followed this game for months on end. We had no idea how the game was going to be like. We just wanted to play the game. Yet, even that was not possible.Most of us experienced issues such as:- Unplayable FPS (<10 FPS even in non-crowded areas), even despite applying recommended configuration adjustment.- Not being able to make it past the loading/title/splash screen.- Game failed to install all needed dependencies, and won't even run.- Waited for hours in a 2000 people queue, only to disconnect because of server crash/maintenance.- Unable to play together due to server lock preventing new character creation.Steam says I have 7.4 hours. Guess what? All 7.4 hours were stuck waiting in queue. In 7.4 hours, I haven't even created a character.We don't even have any complaints like combat, translation, censorship or whatnot. Those didn't matter, because the very basic requirement of an MMORPG - the ability to play together with friends, wasn't even met.It isn't so much that we don't want to play Bless. Rather, Bless doesn't want us to play.The game is quite literally unplayable.Would not recommend.",0

15660,Fishing Planet,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWell I have been fishing in this game for quite a wile, and I have to say of all the fishing games I have ever played this one is hands down the funnest.  I really wanted to pass the joy of catching monster onto others, and so I started making tutorial vids about each of the fish for my youtube chan. Mostly to help other fisherman enjoy the game as much as I do, but with out all the hours and hours I have put into catching each fish, on all the baits they will bite on. I have basically fished exclusively for every fish I have made a tutorial for 6+ hours, and I have to say the amount of coding and though gone into making the fishs AIs, and making all of them so different in the ways they act and react to baits/lures is quite impressive. I hope to see this game develop more and become the awesomeness it strives to be. If anyone is having probably catching any fish, please check out my youtube chan,  get some sound advice, and give it another try, before you give this game a negative comment, https://www.youtube.com/c/cid1313Edit: after the last update/s i can not recomend this game anymore, it is broken in far to many ways for me to type out here, needless to say if you want to know how i feel about  this game now, just check my last few videos of this game that i made, right before i rage uninstalled.... maybe, and i truely hope it does happen, maybe someday it will be back to its former glory and be a game im proud to play and make videos for, but untill then i just cant recomend anyone even try this game. sry",0

256,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewAt the moment the best and worse thing I saw in the game is the same thing: Gems(Real money)-Cosmetic items.Yeah, they're just cosmetic items that's why it's the best thing after all those P2W dlc's in DD1 that broke the game.Also are the worse because you are paying for a game 15$ (or more) and you don't get EVERYTHING ingame.Anyways here the interesting points:+Smooth Gameplay (alpha, remember, it's really good)+Original 4 characters (pleases, not more overpowered character dlc's, thanks)+Great maps, original and cool environment. Also great interaction on every map (water, gas, machines, etc.)+For sake god, thanks for the CAMERA ZOOM, really appreciated.-Perma-Online gameplay. You need Yes-Yes net conection to play, this isn't Diablo 3 you know..-Online taverns. Yeah you can create a private tavern and play with friends or alone, but the first time you play or even connect you'llbe on a online tavern. What does that mean? LAG, people spamming abilities and towers. Just set private taverns as default and it'll be great.-Need a better options customization, yeah, aren't bad at all but even F2P games have more options to play with. (Also FullScreen Windowed doesn't work at all, works, but after some attempts to put it on.In my opinion DD2 will be a good game if they don't bother with so much dlc's like DD1.

5070,Fractured Space,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewWhile I didn't play for very long, it was like a complication due to the manner in which I was playing (over a verizon dsl network, streaming from a windows 7 pc to a windows 8 laptop). The main problems I encountered were a slow network connection (from the router, not the game), fuzzy graphics that did not want to play nice and display properly on my laptop (likely a result of not configuring them properly on my desktop first, or even having to do with the router again), and dropping from games in the middle of a fight (Which I can blame on verizon, once more, but it may have had to do with the game itself).Overall, I would recommend this game. The gameplay I did experience had a focus on teamwork, on strategic maneuvering to enable you to appropriately apply the force you had at your disposal from flying a capital ship, and, well, 3 dimensional movement in space combat is always nice. This game is for you if: You have the patience to play a moderately paced game, are willing to work with your team mates (even if they are strangers), and have been looking for something that focuses on large ship space combat. This game will not scratch your itch if: you are looking for a game like tie fighter vs x wing. You will not by flying small, fast, fightercraft and engaging in dogfights. And that's okay. There are other games that do that, some in space, some not so much. War Thunder (last I played) did a very good job in giving you planes to fly around and dogfight in. Overall, it looks like a game with a good amount of potential that has already lived up to a fair bit of it. It's an early access game, so expect bugs, but the features that are already in (from what I've seen) lay out the foundation for a solid game.",1
14091,Elsword,2014.0,"i've read that the communities of this game and grand chase arguning because they look similar. Because both characters have red headed swordsman, female elf archers, and purplehaired mages they have an excuse to scream at each other. but where the difference ends. STORY: The story is that a stone called the ""El"" were stolen by bandits and its up to the el search party to get it back. The story moves on to each village to move the story. The ""El stone"" story ends at altera when you finish the quest ""Tunring everything back to normal."" Then story goes to Feita with an demon invasion. The story ark reminds me of certain anime like fairy tail or naruto. 9.75/10CHARACTERS: There are currently 9 characters on both versions. what suprises me about them are that 3/9 characters included demons. Chung, Ara Haan, and Elesis. The character are Elsword, Rena, Aisha, Raven, Eve, Cung, Ara Haan, Elesis, and the insane Add. I like Add the most because of his backstory, gameplay, and personality (reminds me of lasercorm from smosh games). I feel mad for raven, chung, ara, and add. raven betrayed by his fellow soldiers, his fiance and friends died saving him and became a cyborg in the aftermath who u can fight in the first dungeon in altera. Chung's dad got possesed and almost died from severe injuries. ara family got slaughtered by demons and her brother became a demon (Final boss of hamel) and add family got killed (not by demons), sold in slavery and driven insane by isolation. The backstories suprises me with any way. (thank u south korea) 9.80/10GAMEPLAY: By comboing your enimies to oblivion through special/actives skills. When u reach level 15 you'll be able to choose multiple paths. 3 for elsword, rena, aisha, raven, eve, and chung. 2 for ara and elesis and currently 1 for add at the time. You will have to go through a quest line before advancing to the next class or you can spend 200 K-ching and you'll be able use new combos with the chosen class then advance to the 2nd job at level 35. either quest line or pay 400 K-ching you're pick. what i really love about elsword is he final dungeons. The final dungeons supply you EXP for you to level up and a challengin boss. There's a dungeon called henir's time and space which actually a boss rush mode. I've seen videos of player beating it with they're best time. There are also secret dungeons when u get to the level cap (70). However there is a stamina system which is spent on dungeons and hunting in the fields. when all of the stamina runs you can't dungeon untill 3:30 A.M. 9.5/10PVP: The match making..... is absolutley broken. my level 42 elsword is set with a max level elesis. you start playing PVP at level 10 its fine at that lower levels then gone to hell later. 0.01/10COMMUNITY: The only was chatting with other players is either in a guild or in the sparring rooms. 7.89/10CASH SHOP: i can't get enough with the cash shop. costumes. check. quick slot extensions. check. pet adn mounts. check. Inventory expansion. CHECK! 10/10FINAL VERDICT: I love this gams with a passion. I have over 500 hours in to this game and my highest level is a add. combo monsters to oblivion. The gamplay is good. Pvp is below average. The stamina can get annoying but who cares. 9.99/10",1

For new players i would advice NOT to go for meta-builds and guides in the beginning. There is so much in this game when trying new things yourself. Challenging on how far you can go on your own. With meta-builds, you skip the originality and learning, trading it with already optimized, cookie-cutter performance. Also, very soon the only challenge is the end-game grind.

19325,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"The game has very little to offer beyond longevity. There's no sense of community in the game. There's no zone-wide chat to cooperate with others, there's only global chat (which takes a consumable item to use) or party/guild chat.As an MMO, it's a failure. The game doesn't rely on healers or tanks for dungeons and missions. Bosses simply get zerged while they mindlessly walk towards their aggro target and use AoE attacks. Healers sometimes can save you when potions are on cooldown, but generally they're unnecessary. Class balance is AWFUL and the AI is really bad, so if you play a pet class be ready for frustration.Leveling goes up to 280 or so with stat points, skill points, and class progression that you cannot undo (some can be undone with microtransactions, but others cannot). Core gameplay consists of:Questing - standard uninteresting MMO fair with minimal rewards.Exploring - small reward for discovering 100% of a zone's map. Very difficult with the base UI, but mods make it less confusing.Combat - hit a few cooldown with 15-60 second cooldowns. Then procede to auto attack a bunch, even if you're a mage or priest. Then use a mana and/or health potion to continue. There's no challenge to be found at all.Dungeons/Missions - kill a bunch of trash and then fight several bosses. This gives MUCH more Exp for the time invested than anything else you can do, yet it has a daily limit of 2/3 for each. Basically this is your ""daily quest.""The game is full of bots spamming their websites in town or in the global channel. Completing quests and grinding Exp can involve more waiting than killing between sitting at a bonfire for SP if you choose to and waiting for monsters to very slowly respawn. There's also the option to camp world bosses that spawn every ~4 hours, what fun!The UI is clunky, and while there are 3 control modes (gamepad, keyboard, mouse), none works 100% correctly. The servers have awful performance despite a very small playerbase, and the game itself cannot maintain even 10fps on a GTX 970. I've routinely seen my FPS go above 120 and below 10 in a very short time period.If you want to try the game and not pay anything, feel free I don't think that's a bad idea. Focus on doing all quests (you need to talk to NPCs, they don't have an exclamation over their head) and exploring all zones. Don't use Exp cards until you are desperate to level up.If you wanted to spend money on this game, please don't. It's in a horrible state and probably won't improve anytime soon.",0

We took a few years off until the game showed up on steam, then we re-envested our time into making our own guild on a new server.

3502,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2014.0,"I like this franchise a lot, and I like this game too. It does open a lot if you pay to play mind you! I find that with this game once you get to Mines Of Moria thing's start to get a lot more interesting, for instance to enter the mines, they give you a Legendary weapon. Also, the areas in the expansion packs look very pretty, the Vanilla game does too, but the expansions even more so. I think the zones are very big as well, sometimes too big, but then again they are pretty acurate to the books. I think my favorate questing area has to be the Hobbit area as that place is the most cheerful and colourful too. For anyone thinking of playing this game, do yourself a favor and get a Subscription, even if it's only for one month, as it opens up four bags, and removes the gold cap, and gives you 500 Turbine Points to do as you please with, plus any character you make in that month will be able to learn to do their riding traits for free which will stay with that character even when you un-subscribe. Overall, if you read the books and liked them, you will propably love this game. If you only watched the movies, then this game may still appeal to you, but one thing to note this game is based on the books not the movies. A good effort by Turbine in my opinion and nice to see they didn't shut it down!",1
16840,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2015.0,"An idle game with a new setting.. but does that mean better?Not for me, but perhaps for the fans of the genre... The progress is very slow mostly because of important upgrade prices and minibosses (each 5 levels) requiring grind.Waiting is long - as an example, being AFK for a day or two won't take you further than 5-10 levels. This kind of shows in the achievement ratios: 16% of players have achieved a ""reset"", 8% have completed area 100 and rest of the achievements are done by very few.I wouldn't recommend right now.",0

17273,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewTLDR : depth of MtG + digital smoothness of HS = muy buenoBackground : I've been playing this game in closed beta since May 2016. I had over 3000 games played until the wipe and open beta. in 2015 I was a die hard Duelyst fan, but have since completely switched over, and I don't see myself moving anytime soon.Eternal is a thinking man's CCG for the digital age, and it's the real deal. It may not necessarily be for everyone, but :- If you enjoy card game but get frustrated at HS, Duelyst, Shadowverse and consorts for their shallowness and RNG cards, this is definitely something you want to look into. - From the other end of the spectrum, if you enjoy MtG but (rightfully) hate MODO and pretty much every digital iteration of the ancestral TCG, this is absolutely for you too.Eternal is a Johnny's dream come true. The deckbuilding possibilities are endless. It's also fantastic to Spikes, I hear, what with the great balance and very low level of card RNG (yes this game has mana screw RNG, which will make you rage a lot if you come over from the HS/Duelyst/etc side, but with how low the RNG levels are through the rest of the game, skill-winrate correlation is still higher here than in any other card game I'm familiar with).Make sure to join the Discord server when you get started !

I have only played 77 mins, just the first couple of tutorials and I am in love. The amount of content you get for a free game is amazing and puts other payed sims to shame. I am already looking at buying the F14 and A10 DLC.

888,Realm of the Mad God,2016.0,"I really do need to play this game more to really explore whether or not I reccomend it. I'd feel bad leading people on that this is somehow a great game if it was only mediocre.One complaint I'd like to get out before I praise it, is the bureaucratic mess that is unlockable content. I am unsure how one earns those playable classes that remain behind a sealed window, and that's what turned me off to playing further than the 30 minutes o the first adventure I did. It wasn't that it was not fun, but I don't like being treated like a lab rat with prizes dangled in front of me I have to pay for. I'm paying enough investing time and effort. These games are hardly ever a breeze and more of a chore to ""get good"" at.But that's Realm of The Mad God's saving grace... is it doesn't really matter if you ""get good"". In the end I don't think those unlockable classes would make much difference in game, as if you die, you die permanently. Much like some of the first ever PC games that were dungeon crawls, and it gives it an 8-bit aesthetic that is both appealing, but also a little cumbersome at times to makeout where exactly the enemy is coming from. It isn't like my squinty Filipino eyes were made for 5000fps bits of fireball spam.What the game does right, and few other games do is reward cooperation and ignoring competitiveness completely. There is no competition, you can't even make it so by player-killing, and I like that a lot. Players are free to go their own way and die quicker if they so choose, but the real strategy is to stick together and make the most out of every player's utility.It is free, and because it's not some cut-throat PvP you should give it a try and decide for yourself since my gameplay amount is rather limited. But I might go back to it if I feel like I could get 100% of the experience at some point. Again, my only real distancing came from the fact I felt like I was being scolded for being a ""Freebie"" and couldn't have access to certain classes.",1

Critical mistranslations everywhere oh well. Actually, I saw that coming when I was a part of Tree of Savior English translation project team on Github for a short amount of time and I didn't need another day to figure out that translations are having tons of troubles. Most of them didn't match the original description because most of the translations were done via Korean -> Japanese(machine) -> English. Pretty possible that Kor->Jpn machine translation wrecked everything up, idk. After I've noticed such problems I suggested the team to do a whole review on everything, I've even told an IMC employee who came to our discord chatroom that things are going completely wrong and they need to hire a professional translator to get things right but he just laughed and did nothing. That was the reason why I left the team. I'm not going to insult my former teammates but sorry guys, I value your enthusiasm but your works were meaningless. Please don't b**ch those guys, they are also victims. They just loved the game and have dedicated their time, efforts, skills to make the game readable to every English player.

The gameplay is fun so far, some good voice acting from the AI and the sound design is pretty spot on thus far.

1929,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst off, this game is HEAVILY pay to win!With that said, the gameplay is fun, the controls are responsive and the assault team / generals system works well. That's about all the good stuff I have to say about this game.Everything that can be bought in game (and I mean EVERYTHING) is absurdly expensive, most of the maps are god awful, the battles are majorly unbalanced and I have noticed the odd issue with net code (almost as bad as it is in Battlefield 4, but not quite). So, imagine this. You join a battle, but the enemy team has tanks. Well you can just get your own tank right? Nope, once unlocking that it costs over 20k credits to get the basic tank, and that doesn't even have a cannon. So, just give your soldier an AT weapon? Nope, again, it costs a ridiculous amount of credits.So quite often you end up going against heavy armour and cant do anything else about it. Sure you get the odd AT weapon that spawns on the map, but they spawn in the most stupid places, like out in the open for example.Most of the maps are so open it's not even funny. They all seem to favour either snipers or vehicles, which you'll be grinding for hours and hours before you get either one of them, oh my bad, you can always pay REAL MONEY to get them early. So if you can get past the crappy maps and the unbalanced teams, there's the people who have actually paid into the game. You then have to deal with people with one shot kill weapons, better vehicles and a certain badge that gives you more HP. There's probably a lot more stuff you can buy to **** over people who aren't dim-witted enough to give this piece of trash they call a game any money, but honestly I gave up at that point.Conclusion:Don't bother with this unless you like unbalanced games and having to pay real money to get anywhere or having to pay to have fun. Like BrazillianSoldier said in his review (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brazilian_Soldier/recommended/227940/), buy Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2. It's very similar to this, only you pay for it once and you have the whole game, no having to deal with and damn pay to win crap.",0

Quests also suffer from constant bugs one way or another, sometimes even progress stopping bugs.Graphics wise it's outdated, which is not entirely a bad thing, but is paired with terrible acting and direction in cinematics, giving it some below amateur feeling that you can't wash off.And last but not least, the user interface is more of a bother than a help. Things like huge symbols in minimap that simply wont let you see what you are suposed to see, to everything looking pretty much the same and thus making it harder to even understand them, or weird design choices like not giving a more direct approach to equiping kit abilities, having to realize on your own that you are suposed to try random keys until you get P and see a selection of avaliable skills.Basically, if you can skip this entirely you won't regret it, it doesn't get any better as you progress, it only gets worse.",0

6448,DCS World Steam Edition,2018.0,"Bear Trap campaign for F-15C seems broken after last patch.  Mission 2 you run SEAD for a DEAD attack on ground targets and the F-16s fly below 9000 feet and get shot down by SAMs.  I'm sure a lot of the missions for other aircraft are fine, but I bought the F-15 module, and after latest patch, where they claim to have ""fixed"" all F-15 missions, I have had nothing but issues.  I don't have my HOTAS out to see about the A-10C or anything, as I am using my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, so I don't have to swap my racing pedals for my rudder pedals, as I am doing some racing sims and stuff at the moment too, but my logitech has twist, and F-15C isn't overly complex.  I have had issues with Missions as well, with one of the couple of missions that exist, loads multiple F-15s at the same location as my aircraft, causing all of them to explode.  I'll buy the F-18, when an actual campaign comes out for it, providing the campaign isn't buggy, but I don't like the fact that I can't use a favorite aircraft of mine that I just want to have fun with.  One of the instant start missions begins at night for the F-15, however, the F-15 doesn't allow night vision.  I don't want to lose the ability to use aircraft from the past, because new aircraft and maps are introduced that take priority over the older aircraft.  The F-18 doesn't have a campaign that I am aware of atm or I'd yank out my wallet and swap my racing pedals and put down my rudder pedals, in a heartbeat, if the campaign didn't have similar bugs or something.  I love DCS World in many ways, but this is really frustrating.

(but that doesn't mean 2 is bad)Dungeon Defenders 2 went through many changes in it's development and it shows based on the quality of the finished product.This game is free to play, unlike Dungeon Defenders 1 was, and since it is f2p that means you have to grind to unlock any new heroes or outfits. The game also overall lacks the polish DD1 had since the game first came out in Early Access and instead of refining and polishing the games art style or animations, they decided to push out a cash shop for new hero outfits and new grind heavy or $10 paid unlockable heros.In my opinion Dungeon Defenders 1 is a much more enjoyable game and is worth it's price instead of playing F2P DD2 and grinding to get any new heros, loot, or gear at a much slower rate.If you are just looking for a tower defense game and you don't have money to spare DD2 is still a good game and is better than the competition (OMDU), but it is just lackluster compared to the original game which it was trying to improve upon.",0

14118,War Thunder,2016.0,"I pretty much exclusively play the Tanks now, but you'll probably see in many other reviews a common theme: Russian bias. The dev's are so offended by the fact that their technology was far inferior in WWII they feel the need to buff the s h i t out of them to make it ""fair"". Don't you think it's great when you shoot at something with 45mm of armor, only for your shot to bounce (even though it's rated to penetrate over 100mm)? sure you could argue ""sloping armor"", but sloping armor only applies when im SHOOTING THEM FROM A POINT WHERE IT ISN'T PERPENDICULAR TO MY SHELL'S TRAJECTORY. It's utter bulls hit, everytime you survive a russian shot, you should put a penny in a jar, that way, in 10 years, you will have 1 penny in a jar. The bias is ridiculous to the extent where the german captured KV-1 (a god d amn russian tank), where the ONLY change the germans made was putting a SUPERIOR GUN on it, will lose in a head-to-head fight with a regular, inferior, russian KV-1. The stats they show on the tanks when you hover your mouse over them may surely well be accurate, but that's just what they SAY the tank's stats are. For russian tanks, you can pretty much reduce the chance of fire to zero, double the armor, increase the penetration, all while nerfing the f uck out of all the other, far better tanks, and then you'll get a taste of that good old War Thunder ""Realism"".

(the ranger class can dodge, with a cool down of 35 seconds!)  Beyond the combat: Bless online offers nothing entertaining as far as questing goes. You mosey from area to area and kills hordes of the same mobs with the same linear boring combos for hours. You kill things, you collect things, then you auto walk them back to turn them in, rinse and repeat a thousand times until your next boring lingear dungeon. Also, all the story quests are instanced and there's no way to do them with friends. Similarly, the first two dungeons are soloable. So, Bless does a terrible job of enticing you with fun content later by giving you a taste of what is to come early in the game. Also, as I'm sure you've heard, the translations are quite confusing on the skill tooltips for. This creates a feeling of just button smashing at first because you're not really sure what the debuffs are or even what your skills are doing. eventually you figure them out by trial and error. People in the game are saying that's part of what makes a game fun is figuring out what works, but that's not what is happening here. This challenge is based on a failure to translate the game into understandable english...if this is your type of challenge, play a different MMO in a language you don't understand.  Gear:  Initially (for the first 30 levels, as far as I was willing to play) you do not find armor save for in dungeons, and even then, you rarely get drops that are for your class. Basically you get new gear by just buying it from each new dungeon merchant. Which takes the fun out of exploring and defeating mobs for a chance of better stuff. Normal mobs have a chance to drop a weapon that is class specific and you will find yourself getting a lot of weapons that aren't for you. And if you happen to be questing with your friends and they aren't close enough to bid on the item, there is no way to give it to them because there is no trading. (maybe they will add trading later, but this is just a minor annoyance anyway) Easily the worst MMO I've ever played. Most people are refunding or quitting because of the technical issues, but there are core game mechanics that are just unfixable without a complete redesign, these (listed above) suck the fun out of the game and create an experience that can be found, without having to spend 40 dollars, by rubbing fine grit sand paper all over your body until you have no skin left.

And after all this time of playing (even though I often took a break of a few weeks) I still enjoy playing Path of Exile very much. So many options, so much unique content, such a nice community where there's always somebody willing to help you with your questions, so many content-adding updates with new expansions, unlimited replayability. I played this for 1500 hours, and will most likely play it for another 1500 hours. Especially if GGG keeps releasing those awesome updates with new leagues, new items, new maps and perhaps new acts. The game might be a little difficult to understand for new players, but the tutorial the game offers explains the most basic mechanics and things you have to know to get started. For a detailed guide to Path of Exile, I recommend ZiggyD's Path of Exile Guide 2.0 if you'd like to know every detail about the game.

20084,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewLike many others, I came to Eternal from the RNG fiesta that is Hearthstone currently. This game is truly a breath of fresh air in today's digital CCG landscape.PROS:1. Although there are microtransactions, this game is truly F2P thanks to the generous rewards system. For example, in Draft Mode (like Arena in Hearthstone) you get to keep ALL 48 cards that you choose, on top of the usual rewards for winning. There are also free random cards and gold for ranked wins.2. Minimal RNG. However, because of the way the mana system works (similar to lands in MTG) you can get mana screwed but proper deck building should mitigate this,3. Interactive combat system. This is similar to MTG where you can take some actions (e.g. Fast Spells) on your opponent's turn, such as when he attacks you. Again, I compare this to Hearthstone where you pretty much can't do anything on your opponent's turn.4. Complex strategy. The cards in the first set are varied and allow for many different deck types. There are 5 factions and you can have all 5 in your deck (albeit risk getting mana screwed). 5. Complex tactics. Here I'm talking about the skill you need to assess the board state and make plays. Each player can have up to 14(?) units on the board and this can lead to deliciously challenging decisions - which units do I attack with and when? which  of my opponent's units do I block and with what units?CONS:1. Clunky UI. This is a minor gripe as it's already in a decent state, just needs a few tweaks.2. Small player base. This game isnt hugely popular now and there aren't alot of web resources (no net decks :(). Hopefully with the steam release this game will pick up in numbers.Overall this game is one of the better CCGs out there. And it's F2P, so there's really no reason not to install it and give it a go.",1

10936,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"I have played just about every online TCG ranging from the most popular to the obscure. I have many years experience as an MTG player and have a wide range of knowledge on card game mechanics. I have been playing Eternal since closed beta, before their was an online store and you had to grind if you wanted a tier one decklist. This is one of the best teams I've seen on an indy game, many of them being MTG Hall of Famers. The game is relatively free to play and has many different formats to support different skill levels of players. With proper collection management, you should be able to craft a tier one decklist within your first few months of playing (I say months because I assume you are ambitious enough to attempt to craft a control deck.) Also, the integration between twitch and eternal is phenomenal, if you link your account and watch streams you will get a lot of free stuff. Now lets talk about gameplay. If you are transitioning from either HS or MTG, you will find the phases a bit odd at first. HS players won't be accustomed to interacting on the opponents turn and MTG players will be upset they don't get priority after every single action like MTG allows. But given a bit of time, you will find that the gameplay is really smooth and fair. The power level of the cards is a bit higher than MTG imo so that can take a bit to get used to as well.Their is a lot to say about this game but the wine is starting to kick in so I'm gonna leave it at this is the best CCG online. You won't find one better. I've tried. Give it a chance and I promise you will not be disappointed.",1
1604,Magic Duels,2016.0,"The first tutorial works fine, and everything was good. But then the 2nd mission of the 1st story, the game cannot even track where my mouse is. I can hover the mouse over the Island card in my hand, but the game decides that it is adaquate to target literally every other card in a random order instead of the Island. The answer to the tutorial was to just play the Island, then the other card, but I cannot even play the Island. And when I do somehow play the Island, the game decides I'm not allowed to play more, and moves into the attack phase instantly. Then It automatically attacks and you lose because of this. For a digital version of one the worlds biggest trading card games, it's very disappointing. If you want to play MTG on your computer, you should go try MTG Online (Official). But don't expect anything great, even MTGO's UI is very awful, but at least you can play on that.It's ridiculous that Magic Duels can even get positive reviews when the game cannot function properly. This game is a pass.EDIT: As of September 29th, I haven't had any technical difficulties as of late. Now that I've actually got to play the game, I can make some comments in how they decide to do instants and abilities. The pause feature is interesting, but I really don't like it. Especially for new players, the pause feature lasts only 1-2 seconds, and is very quick. By the time you see what the card they played is, the time to pause is almost over.Outside of that, the game is fine. Packs are 150 gold each, and only give 6 cards, unlike real packs that give 15 cards. I'm kind of sad there doesn't seem to be a draft mode like MTG Online does. I guess it comes with a pack being only 6 cards, but that's one of my favourite parts about Magic. The game itself is very much playable, if you don't have any technical problems. It will teach you enough about the game so that you can play MTGO or in person MTG. I find it weird that they kind of offer 2 online Magic games (MTGO and Magic Duels). One being a freemium (Magic Duels), and the other straight up requiring money to play (MTGO). They should try to combine the two, and increase the player base for their game, although that has it's own problems.At the end of the day, the game is fine (without technical difficulties), but there are still some issues I have with playing it. Oh, it also tells you about the story, which is pretty cool.",1

1418,Dota 2,2018.0,"Here is my problem with the recent addition of DotA Plus: Valve openly condemned the use of similar programs in the past, programs like DOTABUFF Plus and a similar program on OverWolf, and I believe they have threatened to or have given temporary bans for people caught using such programs (don't quote me on that last line, only heard rumors about the bans). This was a few months ago, they vocalized this in one of their newsletters. And now, all of a sudden, they want to ride the hype train by offering a paid version of what players can already get for free (with the addition of accesories to try and justify the price). There is nothing intrinsically wrong with DotA Plus in such a way that it offers an unfair advantage - it doesn't increase your damage or anything, it just gives (rarely) useful insight into hero drafting, and that's it. If people feel inclined that they spend money for a computer to tell them how to draft their heroes, jokes on them because again, they are free versions available. In fact, you don't even need a program - what these programs do is basically give you a small, fast windowed version from websitess like DOTABUFF that carry all the statistics such as winrates between heroes and common hero laning. Theoretically you can just alt-tab to the website and type in everything, it's just inconvenient because it takes longer to switch windows and type in a timely manner during the drafting phase. These programs eliminate the inconveniences of alt-tabbing and typing, it automates the search-up of heroes and pops up the results in a wondow. That's it. People have gotten punished for using these draft helpers not long ago (again, only rumored that people got temp-bans) and now Valve decides to turn a blind eye on what they have been doing and make us pay for the same type of program because they added some cosmetics.In other words, Valve banned people who used these free programs because it was 'cheating' (not really), and then come out with the same program but in order to use it, you need to pay by monthly subscription (with hero accessories). Scam if I ever heard one. Not supporting this behavior, too many games get ruined because of actions like this, World of Tanks for one example.",0

15341,Path of Exile,2017.0," Single-handedly redefining a genre is an amazing feat. Especially as a F2P game I have played Path of Exile on and off since it first launched on steam. I always could see it's greatness, but there were things putting me off, like the horrible netcode and desyncs. After starting again with Patch 3.0, I could not resist recommending this game. To make it brief: It is epic. Imagine Diablo 2, but amplified in every way with dozens of systems and mechanics to keep you motivated, while the combat feels as responsive and impactful as diablo 3  Story Path of Exile takes place in a very unique fantasy setting. You as the player get stranded as an exile on the magical realm of wraeclast, which is kinda the game-worlds way of sentencing you to death. But you are no ""normal"" exile and soon discover, that you are capable of great power by using mystical gemstones. I don't want to go into too much detail, but for an action RPG, especially a F2P-ARPG, the background is amazingly detailed. The story-telling is somewhat Souls-esque, with NPCs, item descriptions and randomly spawning audiologs giving information to the player which has to be puzzled together to get a comprehensive picture of the history of the world. Atmosphere & Setting Building on the mystical background-story the developers have created a dark and grim world for the players to explore. Objectively, there is a huge variation between zones and acts. While you start on the rough coast of Wraeclast, you soon move into muddy swamps, through dark caverns, fight through jungles, discover old overrun cities and fight in pompous palaces. The variety is excellent and some areas, which lead up to certain bosses, are very rich in atmosphere. On the Downside, I feel that the variation, which is definetely there, feels not as distinctive as it could since almost all areas are somewhat dark and gloomy. I get that this is an artistic choice to reenact the style of world that Diablo 2 was building, but sometimes I catch myself being bored with the sorroundings although they are, again objectively speaking, mastefully crafted. Gameplay On the surface, the Gameplay of Path of Exile is cookie-cutter ARPG: Run through areas, click monsters to death and get sucked into the addiction of finding better loot until you hit maximum level and grind the s*it out of randomly generated endgame-content. Below this surface, there is an unprecedented level of complex systems to keep you occupied. For starters: At the start of your journey, you choose between 7 different classes, but despite genre-convention, your class choice doesn't really lock you into skills and playstyles. Since the active skills aren't learnable on a skilltree, like most other ARPGs do, you could potentially use every skill the game has to offer with every class you choose at the start. Every active skill can be dropped in the form of Gems which then have to be socketed in your equipment to be used and also can be leveled to increase their power.So no skill tree you ask? Oh boy, there is one, and when it comes to skilltrees, it is the mother of all skilltrees. It is enormous, complex and challenges the player in ways, that no other ARPG has challenged you before. Mostly offering passive bonuses and playstyle defining key-abilities, you have to carefully think about investing your skillpoints. But there is always a way for you to switch passives, if you feel like you have missplaced some points, which I feel is an excellent compromise between forcing the player to make smart choices, but also giving you the opportunity to correct mistakes, you may have made.Currency is also a biiiig part of the game and works different to almost any other ARPG: Instead of gold, you can sell items for different Orbs, that you will need for crafting and improving your equipment. These orbs are not only currency between you and the NPCs but can also be used to trade with other players. Player-Trading is vital and the community is very active, so you can always spend your time trading with others to get the gear you desire.What has to be said though is this: Path of Exile is hard. Not only is it hard when it comes to the challenge of beating it's content (and believe me, that in itself is a tremendous challenge), but it also has a steep learning curve for new players. The tutorials they implemented work, but they're in form of texts  and the player has to actively read all of the tutorials to understand the mechanics and systems. Luckily the community is helpful and there are excellent video guides on youtube to get you started. Controls The controls feel tight & responsive in most cases, which is elementary for ARPGs. In the past, I always had my problems with POE since I felt that the netcode was bad, that the game had too many lags and desyncs to be thoroughly enjoyed. I am happy to report that things have improved a lot. Most of the time, the game feels as direct, impactful and responsive as Diablo 3, which is king in this regard. Sometimes, there are lags, but nothing to worry about in the long run. Presentation Technically, Path of Exile is good. Most Textures are crisp, detailed and the animations are fluid and well made. Some of the later areas can even be breathtakingly beautiful. But subjectively, I personally don't like the artstyle of the game. It feels to generic, sometimes it even seems to clean, while the envoirements are too static for my taste. I am bored by the constant darkness and the dim lighting. But all of this is subjective and I cannot critize the game for my personal taste. Afaik, most people really like the look of the game.When it comes to sound & music, I found Path of Exile to be surprisingly good. Most sound effects are distinct and impactful, while the music plays along nicely, especially in the NPC-Hubs. Replayability & Content To sum it up: The content is massive. You have 7 characters, each can be leveled up to 100, which takes weeks of time to reach. You also can play every character several times with different builds and those builds will have unique playstyles. There are tons and tons of loot, skill-gems, materials and other drops to look for. The Path of Exile team is also very busy, when it comes to seasons: Every new season features a new mechanic, which gets implemented into the game. Most new mechanics, that have been implemented in a season, stay in the game to expand the things you encounter. Right now, the Game offers 10 story-acts, split into two halves, while the second half revisits a lot of the older maps, while also changing a lot and offering up new boss fights. Aside from the story you have a S*itload of stuff you can do, so don't worry about content.When it comes to the F2P-Part of this game, don't worry: It is fair: You don't have to pay for anything. You can play any part of the game, for as much as you want for free. The only thing you can pay for are cosmetics and some improvements to your stash, making collecting and sortings items easier for you. While I find the prices for the skins, pets and stash improvements to be quite steep, I applaud the developers for this system, which is so fair, that I spent money on their shop just to show gratitude. TL;DR PROSTight, responsive controls......giving a visceral and satisfying combat feelingMassive content with potentially hundreds of hours of fun to be hadIncredibly complexExcellent F2P-SystemCONSSUBJECTIVELY dreary visuals, while technically soundSteep learning curve for new playersHardcore can be frustrating, since damage can spike out of nowhere and kill you in an instant. Recommendation? If you like ARPGs and are willing to dive into a very complex game, you will have hundreds, if not thousands of hours of fun with this one  ",1
1829,WARMODE,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has elightened me. I wrote this song to express my feelings for this game:    Amazing grace, How sweet the sound    That saved a wretch like me!

9796,PlanetSide 2,2018.0,"A review shouldn't really be needed as the game is Free2Play and you are free to try out yourself, yet I'll still leave one for anyone interessted.I really want to give this game a thumbs up, but various factors have given me a more negative outlook on it than a positive.I have played this game since BETA long before I got Steam and it used to look absoulutely beautiful. The large battles of the time was clearly ahead of its time. A few bugs here and there, but nothing too gamebreaking. The biggest problem of the time was performance, as many people weren't able to play the game without having massive lag spikes or FPS drops. The performance have improved since then, but thats about all that has improved, imo. The graphics now are drastically worse compared to how they used to be. Ultra settings is now High. So much atmosphere and beauty has been taken out. Details, lighting, colours ... all stripped away and replaced by some depressing excuse for graphics. Before each F2P faction vehicle looked unique to the faction, but as of now, if you are a F2P, your vehicles looks gray and boring. No details or anything. Just a gray box you're driving. Before they used to have so much details. Players say its because it created performance issues, but I can't get myself to believe that when they continue to add crazy glowing decals, overdetailed camoflague and purple, sparkling burning skulls. I think its more about forcing F2P's to pay for the game. It also ruins immersion for the P2P seeing such sad looking vehicles compared to before. Here is an example: https://imgur.com/a/jrR0HQyThe other part is the community. I have met some silly and cool people trough my years of Planetside 2, but the community, contrary to what they will try and make you believe, are mostly filled with salty burnt out veterans that still lives in their moms basement and gave up college for this game. Its a community that is unaccepting to new ideas, unaccepting to having a different opinion. All they do is constantly suck Daybreakgames♥♥♥♥♥♥and attack anyone who point out a flaw with the game like hawks. They are completely intolerant to any negativity towards the game in its current state, and many are toxic ingame. And thats my experience with it. The community used to be filled with all sorts of interessting people. Now there are only salty veterans left. That and a few unlucky new players who are getting farmed over and over again nonstop to nonend. Mechanics like KDR is present in many games, but not everyone will have it displayed on your profile without your consent. Anyone will be free to watch your K/D ratio at any time, wich promote bad playstyles. Many people say you shouldn't care about K/D. That it doesn't matter. And altough I agree with them that you shouldn't care, that doesn't stop it from leaving a negative impact. You see, altough you don't care about your K/D, most of the current playerbase does, and it promotes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ playstyles like camping. Few people are pushing or playing the objective as the stats gained from doing so usually doesn't show well on your profile. Before people used to fight each other in huge epic battles, yet now everything feels empty and boring as most people stick back and only care about farming kills, and nothing more. I think this greatly damages the gameplay and will without a doubt burn people off this game alot quicker. Altough many say you start out with the ''best'' weapons, people paying for the game gets things like implants, wich will give you bonuses in battles. They are possible to achieve without paying, but it is a massive grind. This means that the game as of current is offering paying players an unfair advantage over players who are not paying, wich isn't okay in my book. The fact that you start with the best weapons isn't entierly true either. Many weapons that force you to either pay or invest massive time into the game is better than the starter weapons in most situations. New players get a sniper rifle that requires two shots to the head for a kill. Veterans gets snipers that require 1 shot and are much easier to use. Doesn't seem fair to me.Trough the years, this game has gotten worse and worse. The playerbase has dropped, the community turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥ the gameplay turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥and the graphic turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Perhaps this will be an eyeopener for Daybreak. Maybe they will change things more to how they were before and expand on that, rather than ♥♥♥♥ing up everything that was good about this game. Either that, or the community will attack me and tear me to shreds for as much as mentioning this, calling it all lies. I don't hate this game, but its going down a bad path and I don't like it. If they don't change their methods soon, this game will soon be dead. Constantly adding hats and cosmetic items won't save the game. Focus for once on fixing already existing problems holding it down will.But the game is F2P, so feel free to check it out. Maybe you enjoy it. But don't let this be your one and only impression on the game. If it burns you out, check on it later. It might have improved since then. And you won't regret it.",0

There's no need for me to re-hash it here, since the other thousands of negative reviews will do a far better job of that, but it SUCKS to play out a 15 minute game and earn next to nothing, regardless of your performance in the battle.   You'll have to grind literally about 100 15-minute games to earn a single high end module, which you'll need to do several times in order to build one decent high-end robot.  This game is absolutely not worth your time.",0
10852,theHunter Classic,2015.0,"OverviewIm sorry theHunter, I played this game after playing the amazing theHunter: Primal, and the second I loaded up the game I was dissappointed. The UI looks crappy and movement seems to be much, much slower. If you think Im comparing it too much to Primal, then look at it this way. Movement is fairly slow in Primal, so in this one it feels like you are tip-toeing through the grass, even when you are running. Its also harmed by quite possibly the worst free 2 play business model I have ever seen. I just couldn't bring myself to play much of this game. However, I will say that when creating a profile with theHunter it is quite nice to pick an avatar for your character.Positive+ Character customisationNegative- Character Movement- Crappy looking UI- Hunting Licenses (Business Model)ConclusionI feel quite sad for having had to leave this review, quite simply because I love theHunter: Primal so much, it makes me feel grateful that it turned out so good, even in early access. You should definitley not download this game, it hardly even counts as f2p.",0

Now with the change to the looting system they added and in the prosses destoyed the abillity to get the parts you want (robitts are a joke from RP).

206,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"I have to compare it with hearthstone because it's very similar and we all know that hearthstone is at the top right now. I will break into parts while reviewing.Pay-To-Win VS Not So Pay To Winish As Far As I Played..We are all aware that hearthstone is p2w, because without packs you can't have cards, without cards you can't make a decent deck without a deck you are enforced to lose. earning packs is not that easy or fun and when those hard-earned packs give you only 1 rare card it gets really annoying. Lets not forget that they bring a new expansion each 3-4 months or so you have limited time to get the cards you want. you can always pay though.. In this game as far as i have seen it is easier to earn and drop legendary and epic cards. I got like 5 legendaries in my 5 hour playtime. each pack gives you 12 cards. you have more chance and you get what you deserve. P.S hearthstones pack rates made me a fckn psycho.. 1 legendary in 30 packs.Gameplay1-This game has so many card types that i can't even remember while playing. I think a majority them make no sense. charge,poison,stun,spells i can understand every card game has them but there are many others that i can't even remember their name. Hearthstone is easier to understand for these aspects (IDK in what condition it is right now). 2-So you can't attack minions in this game directly with other minions. you select your minions to attack, if the other player chooses to block with one of his minions, you attack the minion instead of the hero. It's a little different and i didn't like it. It gets so confusing with other aspects of the cards. While playing i was like "" how the f did he attack me and i couldn't? "" or ""I just blocked you how can you attack my hero?"" I simply don't like it.3-your mana does not increase on its own. you deck consists of 75 cards, 30 of them are by default mana cards that when used you gain 1 mana and can be used 1 each round. this made the deck creation process more hardcore. You can decide on this yourself but sometimes i was drawing like no mana cards and stuck at 4 mana while my oponent was at 11 manas.Events-Singleplayer etcI only played the tutorial singleplayer mode and it felt normal like hearthstone would have. Also the same modes do exist like creating a deck and playing with other players until you loose a certain times for a prize.I think that is all. I was really hoping to like it but i did not. maybe i still have a love for hearthstone deep in(I don't play anymore). or maybe it's just bad and confusing like i said.",0
1675,Fishing Planet,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is a waste odf your time.  The developers don't support the game.  They address major issues like ""Shiners which cost coins to buy"" are constantly being eaten or lost and never caught.  This was over a week ago and it's still not fixed.  The in game currency you have to spend is a joke.  The catch rate is decent for anywhere besides Texas.  If you run out of money you're forced to grind AWFUL fishing for pennies in texas in torder to travel anywhere.  I highly recommend you not wasting your time or money on this game until they fix all the issues.  Not to mention the community has completely died.  You see the same 5 people on every day.  I'd be suprised if more that 50 people play this game anymore.",0

394,Magic Duels,2017.0,"Don't get me wrong, I love Magic The Gathering, and even though this is a good gateway into the game overall, this simply has too many technical issues to provide a good experience.

2885,SMITE®,2015.0," Intro! Hello! Some know me as Hell, some as Claptrap, but most know me through school, but this review is for all of you!I've been playing smite since Cupid release (about 2 and a half years ago). However, and unfortunate event happened and my account was stolen, so I made the account that I play on to this day. The company backing this game at that time refunded me my gems and limited skins, as well as deleting my old account. General Info!    Smite is a MOBA that pits you as one of many gods against other gods in modes with objectives such as (towers, pheonixes, titans, etc.) Also, all of the characters in game, are based on REAL MYTHOLOGY, such as the norse, egyptians, romans, greeks, and mayans. Smite is also third-person, which is what makes MOBA players from all over gather and play this mix of third-person and MOBA. My only tip for you is that this game will make you love it, and it'll also make you want to destroy it. No matter what, even when you tell yourself you're bad, stick with it. This game, unlike most others gets better over time. Recommendations!  GOD PACK <3Its a great deal, although I'd at least wait until you're level 30 and are positive that you'll completely want it. It is a worthy investment at any price. You get all the gods that are out, and those that'll come out, all for 30$ I got it when there were only around 25 gods I think? I've never looked back.I recommend downloading Curse Voice to chat with friends, and to meet new people! I'd also recommmend to start out in arena and learn the basics of each god. Theres also this neat feature inside the game called VGS, its basically call outs that you'd make in chat rooms such as: [VVGH] Hi! [VSAA] I'll attack! and so forth. My personal favorite god is Hel (look at my name), she is the goddess of the underworld! Each character, like other games has jokes, and taunts. One of her ""jokes"" includes:(light side) ""I know! We should make cookies!""(dark side) ""COOKIES!? WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH YOU!?Now of course, not every god talks about making cookies and beating the living ""hell"" out of each other. But please. without further ado, go out, and slam your own cookies in the battleground of the god, we're all waiting for you!If you want to sign up for an account for the game, please use my refferal link below! Referral link for smite <3[account.hirezstudios.com]This can also be found on my profile, and feel free to ask to add me in game :) I'd party with anyone.[VVGL] & [VVGF]",1
8225,School of Dragons,2015.0,"Free to Pay, and I mean pay, because with all the bugs you sure won't actually be PLAYING it.Took 15 minutes to break the game so thoroughly that I was running off the map edges and played the tutorial twice. Somehow managed to unscrew it with a relog, proceeded to coax it to work for a few more hours (and many relogs) until I ran into a bug I couldn't circumvent. Went to report on the forums and joined a morass of mired users with ZERO support or answers to the various and exciting ways that their game, too, was unplayable.Impressively awful.",0
7924,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI believe that this game has a tooooon of potential, especially to outweigh some of the other competition. The fact that this is on Steam, where many people heavily rely upon to play the majority of their games, the chances of someone trying out the game increase tremendously. In addition, it'll be much easier for the developers to get purchases of Battle Passes and whatever else they may add, due to the fact that the Steam Wallet is much more flexible, as people are more likely to have leftover money after purchasing other games or items on Steam.This is my list of pros and cons during  Early Access, specifically Alpha.  Pros  Gameplay PROS  Clean UI, easy to understand symbols Balanced Classes (for the most part, and also from what I can tell) Marked points on the Minimap show up as transparent pillars in the map, very useful at all stages of the game A different style of dropping, no parachuting which is a nice touch for the pace of the game Dispersion of chests/loot is nice, as you won't find things too close or too far away from each other Variety of weapon choices Class Specific Weapons & Abilities (If you kill another player, you will not be able to use their stuff if it is class specific) Tiers of weapons/armor (Common, Uncommon, Rare, etc.) Forging is very unique, allows for gameplay to be more in-depth Toggleable mount/""vehicle"" for longer distance travel (I like how it disables when you go indoors, as well as the cooldown) Damage Indicators Pretty good hit-registration for its first week of play Map PROS  Very detailed map, with different biomes, like an ice one, forest, desert, etc. in the four corners Graphics are pretty nice for a free game Topography is shown, which is super cool (lets you know how elevated a surface is, so you can know if one spot is a mountain or not, etc.) Labels for places in the map, as well as specifics (where every Forge in the map is, and block coordinates [A1, A2, B1, B2, etc.]) Other PROS  Region Selection for matchmaking Not Pay-To-Win Party Finder for those who do not just want to ""Fill Lobby"" Customizable options for crosshair reticles, audio, video, etc. Controller Support for those who would like a challenge I guess haha Player Rating (does not affect Matchmaking queue as of now, however I would like there to be a list of ranks so we know how we're ""rated"") Report feature Voice Chat (I personally haven't used it that much, but it seems fine) The horse is very buff and the chicken is awesome :D Cons  Gameplay CONS  Limited Inventory to two weapons, (the three max abilities is entirely fine)  No indication of weapon statistics AFTER picking up (when opening your inventory, the only option is to swap its slot from one or two) Is now in the game! No indication of the flight path before dropping No manually reviving teammates (the chicken mechanic is nice, but not always ideal) Sound cues are not always accurate or loud enough, this goes for me as well as a couple of my other friends who all have different headsets (Turtle Beach, Logitech, Razer, etc.)  When opening chests, potions and other items may appear ""stuck"" inside of it, which makes it tricky to find an angle that lets you pick it up.  Auto pickup when running over it now!  Unable to drop potions  You can drop them with ease now Only third person (50/50, sometimes these royales are better or worse with only TP, I am personally fine with both) Choppily moving zone, however that's expected from an Alpha game Map CONS  Minor bugs with the landscape, I've run into a couple floating bushes or things didn't render properly (uncommon though, also note that I have the highest graphics settings) No current zoom mechanic on Minimap Other CONS   No current ""Q&A"", or common questions people may have regarding mechanics, may lead to confusion or people to believe something that is false (such as the chicken thing, and disenchanting)  Q&A/basics as well as patch notes in-game, good stuff.  Model stiffness, sometimes the animations just stop and the character goes into the GMod ""T-Pose""  Fixed now No Colorblind mode yet, which would be extremely helpful for people like me who have difficulties differentiating the colored tiers of items Tabbing out can take some time, occasionally crashing the game, not sure how often this will occurTaking all of this into consideration, the game seems to be going in a pretty good direction. I hope that the Developers are very responsive throughout development, and later in the game's progress. I personally am not a huge fan of Battle Royales, I tend to play them more casually, however, I expect this game to be pulling in some more of my hours.Overall, this game is a 9/10, and you should definietely consider trying it out, especially since it is free!

14522,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has such potenital, add a little more movement options and maps, but I understand that this is early access so I excuse them for not having everything worked out.But what makes me not recommend this game is that its a pay-to-win game. You can but upgrades with gold and instantly rise in ranks and get better weapons/addons. And the tanks that you get in higher ranks ruin the game, they are overpowered and nearly impossible to destroy.I wish they would have made you pay for the game and then have a system with fixed loadouts that cant be change with different classes.",0

1277,Brawlhalla,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you haven't played this game yet go find a way to download it now. It takes what I love of super smash bros and gives it a unique twist. It's a great party game, but it's as much fun climbing through the ladders in ranked. This is a smash esque game where you actually want to have items on! The lore is very well written. I can really see this game being a big hit once it's open to everyone! I would go into further detail describing all these points, but I'm sure many people have already done this in their reviews.A couple suggestions though. - Make the weapon pick up predictable. There have been many times where I desperately wanted my hammer and I got an axe 2 - 3 times in a row. I think changing it so everytime you pick up a weapon it's guarnteed you'll get the other weapon next time you pick up a weapon. So, essentially the weapons are on a rotation and you get that certain weapon every other time.- More gamemodes in FFA. I'd love playing brawlball, stock, and bombsketball with strangers! I don't know how the matchmaking would work though.. Maybe once the game is bigger the less desirable modes wouldn't have that bad of a wait.- Stances should be allowed in matchmaking. I haven't seen all of the stances, so idk if some are ridiculously op are not, but form what I've seen they are balanced out. I'm pretty sure there are really good reasons why they aren't in ranked and what not, but I think it would add an extra element to ranked.- More of the daily missions. I'm sure you guys are going to add more missions, but I just wanted to point out that I can't wait till that happens. As a very casual player (You could probably tell by my review thus far) I like having goals to complete. I'd like them to be more advanced too. Idk what it'll be, but playing as a certain character for 2 games in 1 day doesn't feel advanced enough. Maybe getting a double kill as a certain character? - More things to buy with coins. Don't get me wrong. I don't want you to change any of the mammoth coin costing items into coin costing items. I just want to be able to buy stuff with coins that aren't characters. Buying stuff with coins is a goal I work towards in games that keeps me going. As somebody that is considering buying the legends pack I'm worried that I won't have anything to work up towards with coins. Maybe like profile pictures or maybe you can unlock extra lore?I don't need any of these suggestions in the game. I was just brainstorming. I would especially like for the weapon pick up not to be random though. Ever since Pax I've been in love with this game and I can't wait to see what happens with it in the future. Thanks for reading :D I hope this was helpful in any way  ",1
10930,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2015.0,"Don't bother. Developer is a nutless piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that obviously doesn't know how to run a DB. The game's back-end is a complete mess. Expect to have your recent activity wiped at any time because of ""server issues"" (This has happened several times in the last few weeks) and then be completely ignored while asking for help in the forum (unless maybe you've actually made use of the microtransactions or DLC? I guess free players don't ever translate into paying players?). You can also EXPECT TO HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT DELETED IN IT'S ENTIRETY if you are inactive for 6 months, which in my opinion is only proof of the cluster♥♥♥♥ they call a back-end.Personally I lost IN EXCESS of 10,000XP I was saving to unlock the next gun, when their servers crapped it a few weeks ago. Despite their forum post explaining and asking people who have lost progress to reply, several weeks have passed while I personally have been COMPLETELY ignored. And I have screenshots! They seem unable or unwilling to trace my account activity to verify my claim and re-instate my lost earnings (that cannot be earned again because in-game achivements are still registered as complete). Their preferred method of explaining that they can't or won't help is to literally just completely ignore me.The game itself is fine. It's functional and does exactly what it says on the tin, but the database is strung together with spiderwebs and old coathangers. There's not much more to say about the game itself - It's fine. It has few bugs. It works. It's exactly what you'd expect and no more. In-game progress can be frustrating as the entire web of possible guns is not shown, with only the next 2 guns in any particular branch having visible icons and only the immediate next actually being named. If you want to unlock a specific or favourite gun, good luck trying to find out how to get to it!English is not the first language of the developer, which is obvious from reading the forum posts from them. That in itself is fine as they do an adequate job of communicating (when they decide your comments or questions are worth responding to at all - despite their claims of how ""active"" they are in their community; re: not actually active at all), but anyone who has been gaming for long enough should know that Russian devs are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at what they do. This trend continues here. Also, thanks to one of the in-game achievments, do not be surprised if you have randoms requesting steam friend accepts just for the achievment. You can also expect to see cheaters on the high scores board every day, plus the high scores are broken, almost always with your faster time being displayed and ranked BELOW someone with a slower time.If all this sounds like fun to you, then have at it! This player, however, has had enough.",0
11592,theHunter Classic,2014.0,"I'm sorry, but if I wanted to buy a hunting tag to go hunting, I would buy a real one. And take my real gun, track and shoot a real deer and eat it.The concept is great. I have no issues with the technical side of the game. However the execution is terrible.I downloaded the game, installed, launched it, was a little miffed by the ""Launcher"", I sifted through the game list and found 2 servers I was ""Allowed"" to join. Seriously, there was some kind of restriction on %90 of the servers. Finally got in one server after 3 tries spent a good amount of time tracking a nice White-Tail buck.Aimed, fired.... POP-UP said something like ""Hey, we noticed you tried to kill a white-tail dear, you need a white-tail tag."" I'm like, alright. That's cool you need tags. Then I saw the prices in their weird currency. And the rates at which you buy them with real money. Yeah... ""Free-to-Play"" I see.Then I saw the missions and tutorials and thought, Cool, at least there is a way to EARN in-game currency to buy a tag to shoot a deer in the face. WRONG, the tutorials do not count toward the missions. What? Really? So you have to BUY tags with real money, basically, then use those to complete missions which reward you with a fraction of the cost of the tag... Right.This has to be some kind of scam right?

8443,Fractured Space,2016.0,"An excellent variety of ships with different playstyles. I don't play a lot of space combat games, but the tutorial leads you through nicely and the space comabt met my expectations of what space combat should feel like; great hulking ships with a massive array of beam and laser canons and smaller, more mobile, ships with cloak functions and other tricks. On a free to play level, it doesn't take much grinding to get whatever ship you want, and the ships are relatively balanced. However, I have experienced a few games populated by toxic players that trashtalk other players, even those that are obviously new to the game, but there is an option to report such players.",1
292,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewBless had a really rough start. There were loading issues, fps drops, lags etc. A lot of people left and started creating hate videos on youtube. But devs really stepped up and fixed all of those issues in matter of two days. Loading issue is gone, FPS improved, lags are gone and there are more servers now. They even compensated us with a lot of ingame currency and events.Just remember how other games were at launch, even those published by huuuge companies. D3 was unplayable for 2 weeks (constant disconnects), BDO had FPS issues, lags and overcrowding resulting in being impossible to Quest and so on...About the game, it's a good one. Combat system is very interactive thanks to combos etc., it's more skillbased than just mashing buttons. Devs are working on balancing the combat, so it's more about skill and the fight is a bit longer. Graphics are not bad, textures of anything about characters (face, armors, weapons) are pretty good, the world is as in any other MMO, not bad, not amazing (but scenery is cool). There is end game content missing, but some of it is being released today and rest is coming during next two weeks.Overall, devs are working on it, trying to fix the issues and they work fast.

10513,SMITE®,2016.0,"Third person view behind the character with direct controls instead of mouse clicking for movement is a nice change from other MOBA's. The view and Controls are similar to Super Monday Night Combat which I loved.  Has five basic classes with Gardian, Hunter, Assasin, Mage, Warrior. Each has enough variation within to not get bored.Sometimes can be frustrating other times you can feel godlike somewhat depending on your teamates. Thats what makes it fun everygame is different and you keep coming back to catch the games your team is all in sync.I'm more casual and stick to Assault mode, Arena, and the newer clash modes.

There is a huge variety of ships and playstyles, similar to Smite but with more customizability for powers and weapons. The unlock pace of new ships and abilities for a free-to-play game is very fair. I recommend this game to anyone who likes spaceship combat games and to anyone who enjoys MOBAs. The feeling of commanding a giant capital ship, along with its crew, fighter/bomber sqaudrons, nukes, cannons, turrets, etc is so fun.",1
11605,War Thunder,2013.0,"DO NOT BUY, DO NOT TRY.  I spent almost $300 on this game thus far and the developers have cynically and deliberately ruined the experience for paying customers and made it even worse for non-paying ones.After a fair experience in previous patches, which while they had their ups and downs, the pricing system was equitable and a player would get a fair reward for his time (if free-to-play) or his money, the latest patch has completely ruined the experience.First and foremost is the greed of the developers, evident in the pricing structure.  The latest patch promised easier research of individual lines of aircraft, as opposed to unlocking whole tiers at a time.  That's out the window.  Starting halfway through tier 3, any individual aircraft takes longer to unlock than one of the old tiers would.  The developers think to disguise this by changing the tier system from 20 levels to 5.  Moreover, the rewards for having a premium account or for spending in-game money have been severely reduced, as well.  Given my $270 investment into the game thus far, I am not amused by this blatant attempt at ripping people off.I came into War Thunder hoping that the developers would learn from World of Tanks and not drive their fanbase away with increasingly absurd timesinks and financial costs.  Patch 1.35 was a great experience and patch 1.37 is worse than anything I went through in World of Tanks.As far as gameplay, the gameplay developments in 1.37 are also generally decidedly negative.  Whether it's the selective application of flight model realism, like overheating and compression, to some aircraft but not others (essentially nerfing most German and many British aircraft), or ridiculous changes like increasing the starting altitude of all aircraft in the Arcade Battles difficulty (where you get to respawn). which basically permits people who just died to come in with a significant speed or altitude advantage... the developers clearly don't know what they're doing.  Worse, they often hide behind the ""working as intended"" line for weeks, until they suddenly fix an issue and pretend it never happened.",0
3,Dota 2,2016.0,"I really love this game, and if you like moba then you should try it, the gameplay should not be hard to understand, a big map divided into three routes (Top, Mid and Bot), two teams of 5 players (5vs5), many heroes with different ability and tasks (support, carry, tank), the goal of the teams is to reach the enemy base by destroying enemy tower and minions, there are lots of mechanical and things to learn but it'svery simple if you take time to read a guide or/and play the tutorial. one suggestion is to not get depressed by elitist person who will tell you things like: F**k you, your dad, F***ing SS! etc. because there are lot of people like that.however, in my opinion what makes dota different from other moba is the tactics / strategies usable, well balanced (recently I've some doubt xD), based heavily on skills, a lot of heroes to choose to play and have fun with, totally free and frequently updated.one of the biggest problems I found is communication, for example when you select EU server and English language, the game start and is most of time like..Me: Hello guys ^^Team:привет другTeam:merhaba arkadaşımTeam:Hola amigaTeam:朋友你好",1

6119,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"It's a ""free"" game, so we cannot expect a lot. After almost 10 hours played, I feel like it doesn't have much left, that's why I recommend the game, but with some cons.A short opinon: ""free and entertaining for a few hours (highly recommendable), very limited and grinding after that"". In more detail, my main three points are:- game mechanics very good, easy to learn and play.- it's free: if you don't want to, there is no need to pay anything. You can get a lot of card by free, mostly completing story mode, but after that, the game has a very limited options. For all the Arenas or you pay some coing (an amount that takes several days* to obtain) or then you have to pay real money.- there are some daily quests, but they can be achieve only in the Arena (and maybe in ""play""), but not in practice. As this i the main way to gain coin, makes it harder to enter the Arena, and so fulfilling the quests, and so getting money, and so entering the arena... see where I'm going?So, I would rather pay 5 for the game (and then no entry fee for the Arena) than having this limited options. They can still earn a lot of money from store (people who wants more and better cards), from the expansions and so.Just my opinon, hope it helps someone",1

Overall I feel like the game has improved, it lacking a lot of things the first game had at the moment but it is still in alpha. I am jsut glad i dont have to deal with all those crazy hacks and mods i feel like were rampant on the first game.  For those not familiar with Dungeon Defenders, you chose your hero and battle waves of enemy's in tower defense gameplay with up to four friends. Dungeon Defenders has a good deal of classes to chose, but so far in Dungeon Defenders 2 we only have the 4 original to chose from, those being the Huntress, squire, monk, and apprentice. Really I am hoping that Dungeon Defenders 2 ends up better than the first game. Its supposed to be going free to play after launch so I am really hoping it  gets popular. its a fun tower defense game, especially if you play with friends.   ",1

I mean, you have to frigg'n be ONLINE just to play this thing... WTH?EVERY time you want o ""play""/ disassemble/Assemble a gun, the game has to REDOWNLOAD the model... WHY?? SUppose you live where the internet conenction is bad, or your camping and want to goof off after a long days hike on your laptop. NOOOOOO....Even the shooting ranges are limited, cause it's only for one kind fo gun. You can pick the kindof shooting range you want, choose whatever gun you want and start popping off shots. NO. It's whatever they want to give you, and only a SMALL fraction of guns get to be used in the shooting range.The game is constanly telling you how much more EXP you could have earned by buying a booster pack, and even forking out $40 doesn't unlock every item (good thing I only got the free version.)Disassembly is dumbed down too. Oh sure, some models require you to remove every screw, but, ONLY for that region. Even then most guns assemble+disassemble as an assembly, meaning a group of parts com apart at the simple click of a button. I really don't feel like you learn much.Textures range from realisic, to flat out lazy. The AK and 1911 are very pretty, but guns like the Tech 9 sport few convincing textures (especially the barrel assembly.) The game goes so far as to tell you you can unlock any gun at any time... IF YOU PAY MONEY....While the multiple X-Ray modes, attchments are cool, there's really nothing redeeming about this at all. If I were to actually get a copy that didn't require the internet to even use and still required money to buy, I'd might consider it. But inthe end, it's really a Modern-day corrupt app. And I don't are if the Devs say: ""Well, we want to preven piracy."" To heck with that noise, this exact philosophy is what made sooooooooooo many gamers ticked off about the original features of the X-Box 1. So... Why bother with games like that at all.

Fishing Planet is on Early Access (and free to play), and certainly has its own problems, much like theHunter, but is far more accessible even though there are a plethora of DLC. I wish Fishing Planet would pick up this game and overhaul it.The issue with theHunter is not that the gameplay isn't good. The gameplay is actually great. Tracking animals works like it should, animals get spooked properly, the shooting is nice, and surroundings are, while not visually brilliant, immersive.The issue is that the game is EXTREMELY gated behind paid subscriptions, which inevitably end up in you spending 100s of dollars.

The game WAS fantastic. As of its latest patch, OB64, the game is a watered down buggy mess. The development team has made questionable decisions in the past but most were forgivable.

Killing mobs but not like a stupid berserker no like a smart tacticians. Not every map is made for grinding, some are and on those maps spawn is quick on others they aren't for a reason.Second , Grinding, smart grinding. You dont get exp from quest you get card, you are the one to choice WHEN you exp. Are you on a grinding map ? Then no need of those cards. Stay a level or two there. Also to mention : There are gabs of exp need to level. I guess most of people who aren't use to grind a lot will be block on the second gab zone. Lv 85 to 86 Exp needed = 474,895. To get from 86 to 87 you only need 20,757. See ? Know when to use cards, know when to grind. SmartGrinding. This sh!t is korean don't forget.Now that this problem is resolute : LAGS , Yes. Like they said (and this isn't the only time) the last sale day it got really quick. They din't count on that even if they have should. But let them time to cover it up. About the P2W people are talking about : Dont forget this game is F2P. No money no game. Secondo : In my serv (Orcha) for 500K you can buy a token on market = 1 mounth patrone. Easy. Not easy if you play 2hours/day and if so don't play this game. Next to this the first idea was to avoid bots who is a total faill. If you are a bit infomated about what they do with the community you should know they changed there early access for the community. If community ask at long term i'm sure those things will be no problem. They had to start with something , no ? About the dungeons : They are caped because you win Talt , Talt is some sh!t you use for guild (i dint have a guild yet so im not sure about what it does) and next to that those are really good grinding zones. Going in a duo (if you can) is a nice place for some easy lvling (exept the lv90 no good exp if i remember good) Voilà most of topics i saw god a honest long player view.

Fine, if we say this newly released MiG for 44,99£ that's acceptable for my part.But when this 3 year old airplane cost as much, just no. Put down the price a little Plz. Maybe put down the price on one jet would be fine so those that is new to this and can actually put in maybe 25£ or even 30£ to give this Simualtor a try out for something different would be really nice. If they really enjoy it, I don't doupt they will buy the rest after. I will get the Huey later that's for sure when I can already see how wonderfull this simulator is with details, but that's me, don't be so sure if other will think the same. I think that could help.  Other thing I hope will happen, but it doesn't bother me, but could be a nice thing:-See my body in the airplane and he stretch his arm to press or switch (and i'm talking about an option you can turn on and off to have this) (PS. I just found that it's a thing, don't know how I missed that)-The ground people and my pilot when he bail out to have some proper animations when they walk, I mean, the animation is really awkward. -when I turn the camera when I see from the pilot view when I bail out that he to move his head, I don't think that should be much of a problem to fix, by the thought of how many other things they done. -It could be fun if the aircraft didn't just turn into a pile of nothing when it crash hard, it could just be fun for the enjoyment to be in the big crash when the aircraft flips around and slide over the ground when you make that enormous crash to the ground. Specially if I fly a jet in high speed and slowly get the belly of the plane closer and closer to the ground, and then just BOOM! I turn into nothing on the ground but smoke. -Maybe the things that is stationed on the ground could have some physics to? First time I tried to start from the ground, my right wing hit the stationed Helicopter, and that Heli was hard as a mountain. I don't ask for something super advanced, just that it maybe could move or something. I have some more, but eeh, getting to long now, those are the most ""important"" if I can name it so when it comes to those details. It might see as nitpicking, but it could make this simulator more immersive if you know what I mean.Other then that, it's free for god sake, you get a nice propeller plane free to mess around in. And a Su-25T if I remeber correct now, but in the Su-25T you can only fly it, not press any buttons and so in the cockpit. But you can do that with the other plane. So if you looking for a nice simulator, look no further.",1

E.g. www.hoagold.com offers 100,000 Silver for $0.70.2. Repeated ElementsIt's the same creatures every map. The only difference lies in their reskinning. There is usually a large creature, a medium creature with a stick, a tiny ball-shaped creature and a flying one. They are just reskins.3. Combat SystemSucks. You need to charge and wait for a cooldown for all your skills. E.g. Elemental Bolt requires you to charge your attack and fire 3 bolts. After 3 bolts are fired, you have to wait for >10 seconds for it cooldown.4. TokensYou want more experience? Pay cash to get tokens. 9 tokens gets you a tome of exp. Pay To Win.5.

It's a Point and click style online Action RPG right up there with Diablo - and unlike Diablo III it isn't a sell out: no pay to win.It has the largest (and yet very well balenced) skill tree you're likely to ever see and is generally quite flashed out.It takes many interesting new approaches to alot of things that are generally kept unchanged across the genre - like a deep barter system instead of the usual coin and flasks that refill as you kill mobs instead of having to craete new potions every few minutes.The makers are a ""small independent team of hardcore gamers based in New Zealand"" and they ""created Path of Exile as the game that we'd want to play ourselves.""And it really does play like that - a game a gamer would want to play, and not one that some AAA company decides that they should.I can only say: give it a try, you'll be hooked - it's free anyways.9.5/10",1

1869,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"The game devs awkwardly try to balance realism with an arcade-style shooter, and the result is a game which while fun initially has increasingly strayed from anything that could be considered enjoyable. This is not helped by the fact that most of their design decisions seem to be based around making as much money as possible, a not uncommon reality with free to play games. Rather than fix bugs or ridiculous game mechanics (like people being able to jump off of speeding motorcycles and accurately shoot a bazooka within the span of two seconds, or the ability to teleport into and out of vehicles, dodging bullets in the process) they simply try to add more customization, more guns, more ribbons - fluff that adds no value to the game but lines their pockets with cash. That, and making the amount of time it takes to grind to get good weapons ever longer, an effort to encourage people to spend money on ribbon boosters and veteran membership.This game's simply becoming their cash cow. If you want to find a fun World War II shooter it's best to look elsewhere, rather than braving the months it would take to grind up to a reasonable level to be competitive in this one.",0

5527,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game, has potential. This can be a fun game. And I HOPE, that this game is fun when it is finished. But, the beta lacks balance. In the game, you will start as a regular soldier with a basic semi-automatic rifle. That is fine in all, except when you are in any mid-range or closer fighting. Anyone with a smg, sub-machine gun, will easliy murder you, inless you get a headshot, which is very unlikely. Some may say,""Oh, why don't you use grenades or a melee weapon."" I would respond with, you don't start with either of those weapons. The first two german grenades don't do good damage unless the explosion is close. To hit someone with a melee weapon basically requires you to be so close that it is only effective from behind. Besides, if they have a machine gun, you will be dead long before then.      I haven't mentioned sniping yet and that is because there is no incentive. Most of the maps, I've seen, aren't suited very well for sniping. Killing doesn't give you that much xp, experience. Only five to be exact. However, you can get over a hundred points for capturing an objective.     The lack of progress is irratating. Because at first you don't realize that smgs are important, you will spend all your money upgrading your rifle, assuming that it will help. After about six hours of gameplay, you spend all of your starting money on buying the first grenades, melee weapon, and upgrades. You then realize that you should've saved it for the overpowered smgs. Plus, the first American smg is significantly better than the German counterpart because of its lack of recoil.     After almost twelve hours pf gameplay, I still can't afford the smg, I'm reduced to endlessly grinding for money, and I'm frankly at wits end. I will say that at first it was fun, but now I find myself getting annoyed. I am only rank four, out of twenty two and feel like I haven't made any progress. I think that this game could be fun, but there is some massive issues with balance. If you are really into fps, than you could have fun with knowledge going in. But their is a massive amount of grinding needed to actually get anywhere in the game.",0

14598,Governor of Poker 3,2018.0,"Not a BAD poker game.  The fact that chips actually take a little work, money, or patience to get keeps the insane players out somewhat (ie. go all-in every time no matter what) although they are still here.It is definetly a money grab, although if you have any discipline or self control you can just earn your way to the top by winning hands or just waiting for a free chips event, which seem to happen every 24 hours or so.  Im not that great of a poker palyer and I got to be a ""high roller"" in about a week.I wish the game had something besides no-limit games.  Like a limit or pot limit game somewhere (keeps the aforementioned insane players away).  I also wish there was a way to see a detailed hand history so you can evaluate your play.  it would also be cool to have more options and an easier interface for chatting with other players (it supposed to be fun right?).I will echo the warnings of other reviewers.  STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM BLACKJACK!  I obviously don't know how the game is coded, or anything, but the game seems to nearly ALWAYS get just the right card to beat you in blackjack.

8845,Magic Duels,2016.0,"This game seems to get a lot of hate from hardcore MTG people, but I find it to be fun but flawed. Pros:- Fun strategy/tactics of MTG on your computer!- Free! It is truly possible to earn all the coins in game and get all the cards, though it will probably take you a while.- You can build many decks from the cards you have collected. (No limit as far as I know)Cons:- I generally preferred playing against the AI in Magic 2014, but with Magic Duels every AI opponent feels the same.- I also like playing Two-Headed Giant in Magic 2014, where you can have fun with a friend and earn a card for you deck with each victory. Unfortunately, you get no coins playing Two-Headed Giant in Magic Duels. This makes you feel like you have a choice: do what you like to do but waste time, or do what's not quite as much fun to make progress gathering cards.- The method of accessing your created decks discourages experimentation. If you create 50 decks, you have to scroll through them. This makes it difficult to choose the one you want.Ways to improve:- Improve deck organization- Add coin rewards for Two-Headed Giant- Add more variety to the AI decksOverall Impression:I enjoy the game and continue to play it.

So, I gotta ask;- `Are they now employing chimps to code parts of the game?`.Thats $600+ of gear wasted on this trash.Life`s too short for this dogshyite.There is also not enough communicaiton/instruction as to how to proceed to get any of it functioning.Its also probably why NVidia refuse to have this game in ""GeForce Experience"", its so bad (as of Nov 2016).This gaming rig should kill this title...

11313,Trove,2017.0,"If you got a friend go for it.  Should only take up a few hours if you're bored.If you want to try more classes, make separate accounts. (Although crafting new classes isn't hard you just need to get a special item from a certain uncommon loot box.)Resources you pick up are shared with everyone else nearby so there's no fighting over loot.The progression kind of hits a massive bump in the road at about level 10-12.  Found myself searching endlessly and never receiving much needed upgrades to progress to the next zone, leveling up had to do it and once upon reaching the new zone, worse loot than previous was dropping, completely halting my progression.  The progression is what kept me into it for the few hours but it's just dead now.  Why is lv12 zone dropping level 8 loot, where lv7 worlds dropped lv10 loot?At the start, enemies die pretty quickly as usual and you're pretty much invincible.  A little ways in you might have some risk of death but otherwise enemies just takea bit longer to kill.  Then you'll be at the point where every enemy is just a pure damage-sponge that kills you in 1-3 hits and it's just rediculous.Quite a bit of the game is locked behind premium currency, of which is quite expensive.  And some of it behind a massive grind that would make warframe jealous.  Spending money gets you massive boosts that people yell P2W over.The game does a poor job of explaining things.  You get these tutorial quests that are pretty easy to do then it wants you to craft things using materials it never tought you to harvest so I had to check the wiki on how to progress.  Most of it was go here do this, complete dungeons on the map then move to next map.  And that's actually all the game is, doing random worthless dungeons for the slimmest chance that something decent might pop out.The server lag is among some of the worst I've seen.  Say you jump and glide but then you teleport to the ground because the server didn't register your inputs.  There's countless rubberbanding here and there which massively interferes with combat, causing hits to not register.  Even stuff you can collect sometimes doesn't work.   You'll miss maybe 1% overall because while it looks like you collected it, you didn't.  It's invisible, and once you leave and reload the area, you can now see all the plants and stuff you missed that apparently didn't register.  You and the server often see two completely different things before they try to sync up in the most horrible way possible.There's also a challenge you can take part of at the top of every hour but it's so poorly programmed that if you get in there just before the timer runs out you're just wasting your time you can't get the reward even if you ace the challenge.  Despite being eligible to enter at the time, you are no longer eligible for the rewards because you cannot re-enter the challenge.  It'd be like giving a 25 minute race on a 20 minute timer, they may complete the race but you won't give them the rewards.Essentially the more I play, the more I see horribly wrong with it with nothing good to say.",0

You can also get a match making error that pops up when you try to leave a party. So...yes. You get a connection issues for leaving the server host? ha. When you are in a game and change characters it has a random occurance to kick you out and tell you your login session expired and you have to restart the game to play. It will also do this on other occurances that tell you someone else is logged into your account. Sometimes your spheres won't equip and the network inconsistency makes it so you have to try and try until it works. When you switch characters some of the previous models will be stuck inside the other characters.There are a million problems with this game yet content is being released over the absolute nonexistence of server stability. For a game on unreal you would expect it to run better, but no. No it doesn't. Needless to say there is alot of content to observe! This is the kind of roller coaster of a game where it's so fun you go again even though the sick guy in the front keeps puking all over everyone. when you are ending a map and getting the chest if you change characters it has a 3in5 chance to randomely kill you.",0

11522,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,"Team Fortress 2 is one of the best free to play games out there with thousands, maybe millions of players on right now playing. it is really fun and 7 different classes to keep you ocuppied. there is scout class: fast and can double jump, has a very powerful shotgun that can kill an enemy with almost 2 shots. there is a soldier class, has a RPG, very power for taking out large groups of people or destroying sentry guns from long distances. there is a pyro class, has a flamethrower, good for burning large groups of people together and good for taking out surpport classes, spies, snipers and medics are easy to kill unless they have backup. there is a heavy. good for leading the way and taking out lots and lots of enemies at once, even harder to kill with a medic assisting them and healing them, unstoppable when the ubercharger is ready and activates and thats when the heavy is at its best, has a big gun and loves it like his own son. there is a demoman, has a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher, lays sticky grenades near doors and waits for a enemy to come through and blows them up which pisses some people off sometimes, their grenade launcher is good for corners and hitting the enemies beside the corner and taking them out, unlocks a sword and can charge at enemies and can kill them with one shot unless its a heavy. there is a engineer which its main weapon is the shotgun and of course its mechanical tools to help kill the enemies, the engineer can make teleporters; entrance and exit point, a dispencer, heals him and friends, and a sentry gun which kills and protects a certain area placed in, has a limited sight and cannot shoot from far distances, all the things can be upgraded to level 3 which is the last and best levels. there is a spy, has a pistol and knife to backstab enemies quickly and quietly, the spy is a quiet and sneaky basterd that pisses off the enemies so they rage quit the game so the friends get a better advantege in life and make their job easier. the spy can go invisable and hide from enemies to help make them live longer and hide from enemies who caught them backstabbing their friends and want payback. the spy can sap the engineers teleporters; both, dispencer and the sentry. the medic has a needle gun and a ubercharger that heals friends. the medic is very important in helping the offensive time. if medic and heavy combine and the ubercharger is ready they are invincible and not a force to be reckened with. the medic and shoot needles at enemies and when the needles hit the enemies the medic gets 2 health back for every hit. the medic gets 2 hp per second as a medic and which no class can do that. special ability is to ubercharge and be unstoppable for a short amount of time. and finally the sniper. the snipers main gun is the sniper rifle, its his best weapon and takes out enemies from a far and safe distance one at a time. he a sub-machine gun and is his secondary weapon for medium range combat. his machette is for close combat situations if a spy tries to take him out or tries to run away or a enemy comes and it becomes a close combat round. the sniper gains focus whenever he keeps his scope in for along time and deals more damage. his machette is a powerful weapon and can kill a spy and a scout in 2 hits, other classes 3 to 5 hits at least. thats all the classes ive covered. the maps are amazing and highly detailed, and new maps coming in from the community every month. new guns being made, skins and character customization to personalise your own class to make u unique and one of a kind. new abilities for classes and more to come, stuff to buy at the tf2 store (man.co) is what its called, i think its highly over priced but if u dont have a thing and u want it bad, go to the store and buy it (dont recommend that when u could just keep playing and wait to unlock it the hard way i better most of the time) ok thats covers tf2, hope u like my review and please rate it. i give Team Fortress 2 9/10 from: arcade",1

I don't recommend this to any Adventure Quest fans, but any gamers into crap games, this is right up your alley.",0
1113,Bless Online,2018.0,"I have given this thing a thorough attempt ignoring the other reviews and opinions on this game. What I can say is that it is pretty much an outdated garbage heap with nothing to offer a player. Gameplay, IE combat is complete trash. Messy, uncomfortable, and makes it feel like a bad basterdization of tab-target with a poor attempt at action combat horribly thrown in the mix. Having played some games with hybrid play as well as pure tab targeting and action combat I cannot recommend this games combat system to anyone.Graphics are on par with Archage which is to say VERY outdated and limited. Seem though that some of the visual optimization issues some people were having have been cleaned up so it does (at least for me) run very smoothly, though still visually outdated.On top of this their interface though pretty standard has its own little setback and the setting of it all along with the subpar skill system makes it less than desirable.The thing that annoys me the most is that this game has an upcoming revamped version for XBox that uses the newer Unreal Engine 4 to run on. I feel like in doing so they have pretty much slapped anyone who supported them in the face with this move.Not being hyped or having high expectations when attempting to try this game I was neither surprised nor disappointed. I hope that anyone who reads this will decide for themselves what a heaping pile of trash not only this game is but the devs who designed it and continue to fail the players globally.",0

8198,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis review is my opinion if you agree then so be it, if not then dont i can careless.Ok to start off with this review and why its negative for such a good game.This game was so much fun at the beginning its just a great game with so much potential..... Until it forces you into the bigger map's with higher levels that have all SPENT IRL $$$ for better guns or just earned every weapon already im stuck with a basic rifle vs machine guns, lightt machine guns, high power'd snipers, planes that constantly drop bombs on you, tanks and so fourth how is this fair that im stuck with a basic semi rifle with no addable items in which i mean you cant add a scope or anything to it. And have to wait A SUPER long time to even unlock anything good! i had a 2.20kd until i hit that certain level where everyone had better weapons than me and i really couldnt do anything, so THERE GIMIC is spend irl money to get a decent weapon.... another thing is how do they expect a BETA to get about 11.50 for each month of member just for bonus xp and lil extra s*** i very much enjoyed this game and loved ALMOST every moment up until the uninstall and i thank the developers for a good game to use some of my time on, but i will not recommend any game that forces you to spend your hard earned money just to enjoy a free game, sorry but no i'd rather find another free game to enjoy or spend my money to have a whole new game.P.S. thankyou for reading my review and i hope you take it into consideration, and you dont support such cheap gimic's so they can take all your cash and run.",0

5514,theHunter Classic,2016.0,"DON'T LET THE INTRO VIDEO ON THE STORE PAGE FOOL YOU. IT WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT THE GAMEPLAY IS FLUID AND RESPONSIVE. THE MOVEMENTS ARE CRIPPLED AND LAGGY AS HELL!This one is great for when you just want to slow things down, take your time, and slaughter innocent forest creatures. Unfortunately these game devs have a horrible reputation for greed and poor customer service. They boast that it is they most realistic hunting game out there... and that's not quite true.. While the terrain and landscapes are very well done, the draw distance is very limited (meaning the animals disappear from site within a very short distance from you) in this game, and that is something that a hunting game SHOULDN'T have. The animals (excluding the deer) in the game are very poorly detailed, both aesthetically, as well as their movements. The game engine and graphics are VERY dated. If you've ever hunted in Assassin's Creed 3 or Far Cry: Primal you probably found the animals looked much better, and moved much better. The weapon handling smoother. Not to mention the superior baiting and trapping you can do in those.Then there's the business model. Not only are you required to subscribe or purchase licences (with REAL money) in order to hunt the different animals in different locations, but its also riddled with a boatload of unreasonably overpriced microtransactions for guns, ammo, nests, blinds, and pretty much EVERYTHING the game has to offer. Basically its a wring out every dollar greed fest.All from the same devs who released theHunter Primal from early access while it was (and STILL IS) very much a broken beta game, giving a nice middle finger to everyone that invested in it!Only spend money on this game if their packages on steam are at a MAJOR discount.",0

977,Robocraft,2016.0,Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewNew update ruined the game. The game is no longer as fast paced as it used to be and the buy to sell ratio for blocks is terrable.

362,Creativerse,2017.0,"As someone who always needs an idea, and never knows how to get started when I do get one, I'm a fan of the blueprint system in this game. I like the challenge of gathering the materials for the build, and the customizability of the blocks in the blueprint doesn't limit my creativity. The abundace of recipes and blocks make it so you won't grow easily bored. When you're working on a build, or focused on terraforming the perfect spot for a build, it's really easy to get sucked into the game. Personally, I have a tendency to wander, so the map and touchstone/teleporters are great for when I (lacking any sense of direction) inevitably get lost. I've scattered projects across many biomes and I still haven't fully ""discovered"" the world in which I'm currently playing. Creativerse is a great game to play alone or (if you've got 'em) with friends. I started this game while it was in its early access stages and it's been great to see how much it's grown since then. That said, however, I do wish they would add more content to bring my friends back into the game, as I know they don't like that there's not much to do or see in the game lately. There's a lot more they could do with it and I hope to see it soon!",1

So having this feature is probably what will make me want to play.It looks like it would be a fun game to play with friends.I might play some more, I think it's worth the free try.

This game can be pretty confusing or overwhelming at first but these guys are very helpful. I would also like to point out that while the community is full of salty vets who post on Reddit about nothing at all, they are very helpful if you ask them for advice, they will help. I would also like to warn you that your performance may feel like your a potato shooting marshmellows at teleporting space aliens (thats an exageration by the way), Cyrious also has some helpful videos on how to fix that. If you stick through and keep on playing you'll find that this is an amazing game that nothing else can compare too. Another plus is that you will be coming in without any prior knowledge so you can't complain how the devs ""ruined everything."" As a side note: see above ""salty vet."" When you start, and this is for you who didn't watch any YouTube, Planetside 2 does not have skill based matching. This means that if you think your a real badass player on Overwatch or something like that, in Planetside 2, your fighting against everyone with no restrictions to skill. This may seem like a bad thing but it's really not. NOW GO WATCH SOME YOUTUBE IT WILL REALLY HELP. Though i suggest avoiding igorawr for now, you can go scar yourself latter... :) Now go have a good time and WATCH SOME YOUTUBE!

But then, I slowly began to start playing it more and more, and now I'm hooked, and I just love it! The characters (the playable classes), the maps, the game modes, it's nothing but hours of endless fun! Sure, you'll come across hackers every once in a while, and being put on a team with TERRIBLE Teammates isn't exactly uncommon, but all the negative stuff aside, this game is amazing!Even if you don't like shooter games, give this game a chance! It originally wasn't my thing, but now it's my favorite game!There are a lot of things you can do in it, inculding taunts, with the playable classes, and along with that they're all different, which distinct cosmetics, hats, and so on (they also have their own personalites as shown in the ""meet the team"" videos on YouTube, but if you're interested in the actual game rather than the characters, just don't search them up). I've played each class at least once, and yet it's STILL really fun to experiment with them, because there are plenty of things I've never done before with each of them!As for gamemodes, well, there's a ton of them, meaning that if you dislike one, there will be one you'll like! Gamemodes inculde payload, control points, MVM, etc...There are only a couple of problems with this game that I think are worth putting into this review, the first one being matchmaking, the weird way that servers are done. I hope for this to undone in the future. The second problem isn't with the game itself, but with the playerbase, but I understand that there's no way to control people, and people are going to be rude no matter what online game you're playing. The main reason I put the second one is because it's common to come across twelve year old kids (that are too young to even be playing this game) screaming swear words into their micrphones, but just mute them and all is good.Overall, get this game, but as I said earlier, it's NOTHING but hours of endless fun!",1

This game could be so much better, it has so much potential. Even in its broken state I'll play and still have fun, but it's only in BR. Survival kinda seems like a waste, or at least a good way to practice your controls or setting up the game before you hop into BR.

It's certainly not a pay to win cash grab in fact it offers a huge first time promo for new players which gives you a tonne of card packs to get you started which if used properly could see you having a close to perfect deck out of the gate if you know what you're doing. It's also quite a competitive game with an outstanding rank system, rewards, missions, single player and story mode.For me the game is a breath of fresh air and I was so happy to find it being free to play with no real restrictions blocking us from enjoying the game to it's full extent. I believe this game was released as a free to play for players to enjoy it and to support the next phase in the game that will be released soon and I will be a whole hearted supporter after I've sank my teeth into this game. But be warned, it's extremely addictive and could have you hooked.The only negatives I would say is that the game is not complete yet however there's more to come and the game is still new.

After the first 50-100 rooms or so it becomes clear that the cutesy cardboard jumpscares aren't the only thing plagueing you as you journey through what quickly becomes a monstrous hellscape born out of your own nightmares. The game also nods and pays homage to most genres of horror and even references some popular horror games such as Five Nights at Freddy's and Resident Evil. The game isn't very long but if you're a coward like me then you'll only be able to play it in short, 200 room bursts.  If you're bored and looking for a sp00ky time then pick up Spooky's House of Jump Scares and prepare to spend a lot of money on new underwear because trust me, you'l need them.",1

1447,Robocraft,2017.0,"I played both the original robocraft and the one currently available on steam. The original one had and Experience progress system where you unlock different weapons and lbocks with exp you earn, after which you could buy these blocks with creddits you would earn or with money. During the building of your bot your tier level would increase, which would influance which opponents would roughly be searched for to go up against. Battle were fought somewhere between 10 v 10 or 12 vs 12, but could be randomized (like 6 vs 9) depending on how strong the bots were. Battle was fought world of tanks style. One life, one enemy base, one friendly base, and go.New version has different battle modes, of which the main mode is a conquest based map with 3 different points to capture, and respawn enabled. There is no Exp system, and no tier system. you have a maximum of 2000 points to use, that's it. Blocks can be bought, with points (slowly earned or recycled for with parts you own.. don't know the numbers but seems like 20% or so of it's original worth) or with money. they can also be earned with... our all time favorite ..... lootboxes. Now, the reason i came back to the new steam version was because i remember Really enjoying the old verison. And to be fair, although i would rather battle multiple enemies at once and retry next round, the new battle mode is still fun, going around with bots. Building is still the same (appart from the tiering stuf), and it's fun to build. However, what put me off was the ridiculous amount off ..... I would describe it as ""Rubbing it in"" that you are not currently a paying customer.Some examples:When recycling your unwanted parts for dust points it blinks on screen that you would get 4 times as much dust if you were premium.When opening lootboxes, which you do get at a fair rate (1-2-3 a match), you open 8 blocks, weapons, etc. off those, you receive the bottom 4, the top four are closed off with a neat sign saying Unlock with premium.I would say i am resistent in buying these things and only spend money when i am certain the developers deserve it, more as a donation then actually buying the stuff presented. But this game forces me to evaluate if i should not spend my money on there every 10 minutes.In short, Fun game, went in the wrong direction, still fun but not worth the trouble if you don't intend to get premmium.",0

Therefor this review is biased from a ranked players perspective.HIGH SKILL CAPIf you're looking to dedicate alot of time and crush other players then this game has that to offer.  Skilled players are rewarded and it feels good outplaying the opposing team.  Mechanically gifted players will definately thrive here.  The macro game is important, but ultimately when both teams are tied, the team with the best mechanical skill will usually come out on top.COMMUNITYIt's a moba.  You know what to expect from other players.  Other than the usual f*ckboys and trolls that litter all mobas. the community is pretty great.  Smite playerbase is small compared to in competitors so you'll occasionally queue into the same people if you play enough.  HiRez is also very strict with behavior in games, you will be banned if you consistenly get reported, afk, harass, or just overall f*ckboyness.GODS (heroes)There are currently around 80+ gods available for purchase right now.  With new gods revealed every 4 weeks approximately.  Gods are divided into 1 of 5 archetypes; Warrior, Guardian, Assassin, Mage, or Hunter.  Gods are incredibly varied from one another allowing for a ton of different strategies and team comps.  There are only about few gods that are unplayable in high level ranked due their kits just not being able to compete.  But more importantly there are no gods that feel unstoppable or/and unfair.

First Person Shooter side, which is fairly straightforward, but depends on what units are positioned on the RealTime Strategy map. As you level up, you'll be able to move some teams around on the RTS map yourself, and give your FPS player some backup/respawns etc. The three factions fight for control of Europe, which you win by capturing the majority of the major cities on the map.Expect there to be changes to the gameplay, they intend to change it a lot as the game develops.

12134,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFor new players and skepticals, here are several things that are helpful to know. This game is a true hidden gem, and leagues better than what a first look would indicate.1) For all that matters Eternal is functionally out of beta and has been for a year. The devs constantly roll out new features that the community didn't even know they wanted (like puzzles and casual mode - which, fair warning, is unranked and new players will do well to play in ranked instead of casual). It is fully worthy of being a released game, so don't let the tag stop you.2) The tutorial is, for many players, long and arduous. Don't let that turn you away from a great, great CCG both gameplay and economy-wise. Push through it, and you'll be rewarded. You only need to complete the first campaign (Fire), then complete a run of Gaunelet (you can concede the first game if you like), after which everything will be unlocked for you.3) Many of the reviewers on here complaining about the power system are overexaggerating and/or don't use the proper tools the game gives (and has been supplying increasingly with the new sets) to migitate it. Moreover, there are legitimate arguments for why this system makes for a better and more dynamic game. I have 600 hours on this and power screw has never been enough of an issue to bother me.4) Yes, there are pushed cards in the game. No, this does not mean the balance is bad or that new players are gatekeeped from good decks. There are several ranked viable decks that contain little or even no legendaries, not to mention many budget decks that will service you fine in lower ranks. The pushed cards help serve a purpose in supporting factions and metagames, and enable new archetypes instead of being overpowered (yes, really.)With these things in mind, I hope you give Eternal a try and enjoy it as much as I do.P.S.For more detailed information on the F2P quality of this game, and the necessity of its power system, read the below articles. They are long, detailed, and contain copious mathematical explanation.

Great for people with a low budget (it's free!) who want to drive or fly vehicles from the Second World War and early Cold War.

15141,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,"This game is absolute garbage. The spawning system is obsurd, instead of allowing you to spawn at the points you capture or spawn on your squadmates it forces you to spawn super far from the points of contest. After a certain point the game will kick you and your squadmates from a match if you die a lot. The weapons require severe balancing and the base weapons are terribly inconsistant in both accuracy and damage. this game could be such a good game if the devs would just start giving a $#!%. The final compaint I have is the in game economy, Id rather pay 20 to 30 dollars upfront for the game than play a game where the guns and equipment are so expensive that the only way to progress in a time effective manner is to spend money.

This game is just awesome!Some say it is a rip off of Minecract...so what, its a brilliant rip off and I really love it, and surely that's what matters in a game, fun and enjoyment! I am a huge fan of MC, but over time I lost interest now I have done everything in it. Creativerse is a refreshing change, it is 'similar' to MC in many ways, but in others different and lets be honest, how many games are there out there like H1Z1.I love the textures, the sounds, and yes the crafting and mining seem odd to begin with but you get used to it very quickly. The monsters and animals are comical, not very realistic but neither are they in MC.It is a matter of personal opinion, and for some who have played MC, Creativerse seems like a rip off, but for many it is a new game with a new world to explore using the good bits MC had and leaving the bad bits out, it is a massive improvement with a lot of scope. My only gripe is that they should have just released the entire game with one price tag and not bothered with all the in game purchases and upgrades, because I feel that this game is good enough not to need to do this. The free access is still good enough to have a good game play IMHO.Overall, great game with great potential and hundred/thousands of hours of game play.

17436,Paladins®,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI CANNOT reccomend the garbage scum that is Paladins.I played since patch 0.9, this is long before the game was added onto Steam. Please ignore my hours, ignore my in-game level. I played the game far more in its earlier stages when it was balanced, and actually good.That's before ammunition was added to the gameBefore rolesWhen everyone was a dpsAnd you fought in a moba-style map.Paladins has gone nowhere but completely downhill. If you're thinking ""Oh the reviews are getting bombed, must just be some salty players about some random nerf."" Do not shrug these off. Paladins has reworked their entire system to be fully pay-to-win. Not just Pay to Win, but the current design murders the fun for every veteran of the game.The only way to physically win in this game is to pay horrid amounts of real money for chests. Let me summarize this massive update: When Star Wars: BattleFront 2 (2017) was ruined by its loot box system, Hi-Rez literally (and I mean literally) took inspiration and applied the exact same system into Paladins. This game is exactly the same as Star Wars: Battlefront 2 (2017)'s progression.Veteran players who had every single item in the game (For example: Me)Veteran players who dumped hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game (For example: Me)These players had their collections destroyed. We had every card, we had every single perk. Now? We don't.Hi-Rez took hundreds of dollars from me and my fellow Champions, and threw it all away.♥♥♥♥ you Hi-Rez.If you wanna complain about this, do it on the Reddit. Don't bother with the Steam forums, you get banned for smack-talking this game in any way by the Nazi mods.I will never play this game again unless the system dramatically changes. Not just dramatically, mind you. I don't want the system we had in place for the past year, I want the old system. We all want the old system. None of this modern horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ you have my god damned word.Discussin comments, I will reply as quickly as I can if you have any questions.God help us, because Hi-Rez won't.PS: They complained about Paladins stealing from Overwatch, let me say my peace on this.Most of the designs in Paladins came first. Fernando was a thing long before Overwatch was a pipe dream. I own both games, and I have no bias towards either company, I like both companies' past works. I prefered Paladins over Overwatch for many, many reasons. Main reason was Paladins required decent skill and knowlege of the game to do well. Now I play neither. Do your research before you comment, thank you.They said Paladins was the poor man's Overwatch, now Overwatch is the poor man's Paladins. ",0
20031,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"Overall: 3/5, not terrible but better off playing a different card gamePros:-Great Elder Scrolls Taste-Various Modes to play (story, arena, vs), you still have plenty to do against AI-Not too difficult to get into-You can choose to play it completely free-Story mode offers many rewards-Has two lanes-Neat Prophecy system that allows you to draw a free card when your health passes certain intervals. You can draw certain prophecy cards giving you a competitive edge or turning around a tradeCons:-Story isn't ""fantastic"" (about average) so isn't really worth playing for story, just gameplay-Has same card effects as other card games just with different labels, ex: Divine Shield (HS) -> Ward (ES:L), Life Link (MTG) -> Drain (ES:L)-A lot of content is locked behind levels (will explain later)-Feels like a lack of cards, the starting card decks are majority of all the cards-Less to offer compared to other leading card games such as Hearthstone and Magic (when a competing card game should attempt to equal or surpass in other ways)Just overall this game just starts to feel a bit bland after a while, due to lack of wide diversity of cards, material too similar to other card games, and ""level barriers"". Yes, I am aware that as a card game it should feel similar to other pre-existing types, but it just matches too much. The main difference in this is image, the two lanes (which sounds neat but doesn't add a whole lot of change) and the prophecy system.Rant: One of my major complaints is what I am calling ""level barriers"". A decent chunk of content is locked behind certain levels you need to reach to unlock it. This is understandable to a certain point, you should have enough experience with this to play more advanced stuff but is just overused. Certain starting decks (helpful to new people) are locked behind needed levels or progress in the story. Arena modes also require even more progress and levels (although it does make sense in respect to the story). There are also cards that start off fairly bland (no modifiers) that require you to reach a certain level in order to upgrade them. This sounds cool but think of it like this: you get a new rare card that has limited abilities since you aren't a high enough level. The game makes these upgrade cards worse with their crafting system (soul trapping, just like dust in HS) by making it so you cannot soul trap them until they are upgraded. To explain, if you do not want a card, you can soul trap it for material to make cards you want. Since you cannot soul trap these cards (many are legendaries, worth more material) you will hold on to them until you reach a high enough level to finally disenchant. To make this worse, people can get actually craft the upgraded version of the cards, meaining if you were to pay or play way more to get more cards, you can craft upgraded cards, which you would get by playimg more and leveling up. It's just a dumb idea in general, I would prefer if they didn't include it. Anyways that's my rant, game just doesn't compete to others of its kind, thanks for reading, etc.",0

13707,Dota 2,2014.0,"Ok so its dota 2, The larges and most popular game on steam at the time of writing, If you dont have this game and you are an avid gamer. You will most likely pick up this game at some point, due to the fact that it is free, and well why not? From a Graphics point of view at maxed out on a GTX 660 easily it looks fantastic and that isnt even the best graphics card so the requirements arnt huge but much lower than that on budget PC with the worst graphics card ever and you might get a few people compaining about your *Wooden PC* increasing the time to load up into the game, and if worst comes to worse you can turn it to complete minium and I bet you that even if you laptop has one of the worst GPU's on the market you can eventually get it to run at a playable pace.From a gameplay point of view, as you can see I have spent well over 500 hours on this game so it must be pretty good and some other reviewers have spent from 1000 hours and above, the reason?Well there is 1 map that has a few variables that can change the game such as the runes, weather you get a good creep from the jungle to control and take on your enemies with. So 1 map you think hummm that must be pretty limited, well yes i would kind of agree with you but the fact is that becuase of the 100+ heros and many hero combinations and counters no game is the same with each game changing the way you play slightly depending the character you play, how you play it and who you are against and how they play it so the game does take a while to get old and even then having the same map means that you can really know it, like REALLY know it. How to do specific techneques and pulling creeps, where the enemy heros can see you and how to position yourself. So in that term the gameplay remains fun and interesting while still for players like me challenging.The Community: This is the one issue you get with this game some people are not very forgiving for your mistakes and there is a lot of anti-russian stuff, mainly because when you go to play on an English or US server and you get strange man shouting at you and your team in a strange language that no one on your team but him can understand, people get a little (to say the least) annoyed. Althrough the higher your battle rank and mmr (I will talk about that later) means that eventually you will get players who actually make an effort to co-ordinate with you.The Ranking system and how valve makes its money: So the game is free and so how does valve make its money? Well first let me explain the ranking system: Basicaly after each game you will recieve an ammount of battle points for you to increase your battle point level, each level you will recieve an item (I think) and acasionally you will be able to open a present to get free items, these items can also be dropped through luck randomaly to people at the end of the game. Valve also sells hero costumes in the dota store/in game shop these items will only change the look of your character and will not actualy affect the gameplay which I find very unique and means that there arnt huge pay to wins in the game which annoys me hugely when people make a good game and then make it pay to win. These costume items are very effective with the steam market allowing players to sell their items cheaply to other players but valve still profits of that by taking a transaction fee. Also due to the popular steam workshop players can submit their item designs to be avaliable in game and they will also get a cut of the money made which is a nice thing for new artists to make some money while having something to potentially put on a CV.Also when you reach a battle point rank of 13 you will unlock ranked matchmaking which will allow you to play games with other people of that level 13 and higher to increase your MMR with the top MMR being 7500 and bottom 0 (You really have to be bad to get 0) with 5000+ mmr being very high. MMR is for more serious players that want to really test their skills with others of that level, but on a down side note, 2000-2700 mmr is very hard to get past as there are people from all different abilities so that can be a little dificult to get past. but eventually with experience and a little luck you will get past and eventually be on the climb you your ability level.This concludes my review for dota with a few 10/10 statisticsAlso please consider taking a look at my youtube channel where there is some dota content and some help videos for new players: https://www.youtube.com/user/MerlinICVideosGraphics: 8.5/10Gameplay: 9/10Community: 6/10 As it gets better later onRanking/Progression System: 9/10",1

8023,Fallout Shelter,2018.0,"**TLDR: requires lots of work, not fun at all, poorly made, exists only as a vehicle for microtransactionsFallout Shelter started as a typical BS ""freemium"" game, made for mobile phones.  The mobile game market is aimed at those who are susceptbile to addiction, and the games exploit players in a way very similar to gambling.  There are lots of slot-machine-like sounds, and visual stimuli for completing milestones and objectives.  Payouts are randomized to encourage habitual attention.  Unlike gambling though, you'll never get money back out of it.The game is also a grindfest, making you perform tedious tasks, and wait for long periods of time.  The waiting times gradually increase, eventually getting to as much as 2 WEEKS to complete tasks.  That's 14 days of real-world time.  For example, it would take 1 dweller with decent stats 2 weeks to make one top-level weapon.  The reason it's so difficult to accomplish anything is simple: if you make players feel impatient, the most addicted players will pay real money to advance toward their goals.The gameplay mechanics are severely broken.  The combat is sluggish, and not interactive in any significant way.  The ""mysterious stranger"" random events are frequently interrupted by incident events, which automatically move the camera away from the Where's Waldo 5-second mini game, which by the way is already almost impossible due to the time limit.Games like this are not made to be fun.  They're made to exploit players.If you play this, expect to check in for a few minutes at a time, while you essentially babysit the game all day.  Every day.  Forever.  It's more of an obligation than an actual game.They could easily make it more fun by reducing the requirements to complete objectives, or by speeding up combat, or adding V.A.T.S. to combat, or by increasing the variety of activities available.  They won't do that though, because it's a lazy cash grab.",0

5846,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewPros:+ The few back and forth matches that happen from time to time are actually incredibly complex and fun+ Constant stream of packs, generous rewards+ Mana system allows for wide variety of decks+ Similar to Magic the GatheringCons:- Most games go into top deck mode- Mana screw/flood is absolutely infuriating- Legendaries are very expensive- Stubborn playerbase (will elaborate)Here's the official developer's stance on getting mana screwed:https://www.reddit.com/r/EternalCardGame/comments/64ktxt/lets_talk_eternal_im_dwd_game_designer_patrick/dg4qiam/I think this is very misguided. CCGs are fun not because everyone is a serial gambler who wants to coin flip everything away. Variance is fun when it allows every match to be different, with different decisions to be made. Take League of Legends for example, variance and depth both come from champions picks, which you can counter by changing your playstyle. As far as I am concerned, every match where I'm mana screwed is the same. I have no decision to make except watching a slideshow of the opponent interacting with my face.Since the playerbase is comprised of mostly Magic players, anybody who is not satisfied with the mana system is usually discredited and directed to play chess instead, which is very insulting. Also, while the deck-building element is fun and a strong argument for the system, it simply becomes available too late to new players since a diverse collection takes a very long time to build.Another praise I often heard for the game is its complexity and decision-making, which is why I became interested in the first place. Again, this holds true for deck building but during a match, you go into top deck mode pretty often and the game is often decided when one person gets mana flooded.Verdict:Overall, Eternal is a near exact copy of Magic. To me this is a good thing, since the base gameplay is already very fun and unique. However, I cannot recommend this game, since it will also result in some of the most infuriating gaming experiences you will ever face, and the developer's stance on the issue means the situation will never be resolved, and the game will never significantly differentiate itself from Magic.",0

1801,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2015.0,"Looking at this game at first I could not for the life of me figure out how it would be entertaining, to be honest it looked stupid and boring. Boy, was I wrong, it's basically a Puzzle, Memory type of game where you learn how to take apart and reassemble real weaponery. Once I found out what the game had to offer I was hooked. I find it quite good and a little addicting. It's very casual too, hop in for 5 minutes or 1 hour. It's not like most games out there that really impose on your time to get something done.The game is free, you only start with one gun but it's easy to get points to unlock other guns. So it's NO WHERE near a pay2play. I have around 11 guns now and enough points to probably buy two more guns depending on what I want. I actually feel quite guilty because I have not yet paid for on of the packs the game does offer which are around $10. I mean it's so cool of a game that I'd like to support the Development team.I don't know if this review will help much but if you get anything from it, learn from my mistake. I thought the game was stupid looking and almost passed it by but once I tried it I found out how great it is.

Then I went off to try and hunt.Found a bunch of deer, yet every shot I took my gun lowered and I got a message saying I have no license.After a bit of investigating I found out all about the supposed licensing. The ""free"" part consists of 1 type of deer and a type of bird.Went and looked further and decided I'll try the $10US membership so I got all licenses.After that I went back and things went down hill. Spent quite a few hours playing and the more time went by the less animals I found. Some times I'd be following a track and suddenly the ""huntermate"" would turn me around or loop over the previously found track. Other time the track I was looking for wasn't actually in the direction I was pointed and other times it'd just go cold out of nowhere. Some ""mate"" that is.On the way back to the camp I see a turkey out of nowhere and so shoot it, to which I get told off for an ""unpermitted hit"" for using the wrong ammo. So I leave and go to the shop to find all the ammo costs more real money along with every other item.Going to uninstall this, and if I could I'd have my $10 back too.Steam should also remove the ""free to play tag"" since 99% isn't free.",0

9043,Dota 2,2013.0,"To fully illustrate what makes DOTA one of the most compelling multiplayer games of all time, it helps to have a bit of background on the game itself.DOTA has its roots as a Warcraft 3 modification. Warcraft 3 introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of ""hero"" units - units that actually gained experience points, abilities, and items as the game progresses. This really made it feel like you had an investment in these units, and you grew attached to them. To a degree these hero units, effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units, became your avatar in-game. It was a brilliant concept, and DOTA took it a step further.DOTA created a multiplayer mode that focused *exclusively* on playing these hero units - it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard RTS format. It's one of the best examples of ""less is more"" than I've ever seen, and that description hardly does it justice. Managing your individual hero and your income, position on the map, constant decision making, and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game I've ever played.I've yet to play any other multiplayer game where *every* member of your 5-man team is crucial to your victory. Everyone must do their part, and do it better than the other 5-man team. There are very few cases of where a game can be winnable 4v5, and teamwork becomes a huge factor. In the most intense and close games, the level of immersion really can't be matched. It's hard to think of another game that draws you in more than DOTA, especially when other people are counting on you to do well! It's a hectic, stressful, enormously complex and in-depth experience - not to mention absurdly fun. This is what keeps me coming back, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer.

Why its call quick match when its slower than custom match lolanother qm problem is most of the time its random in to the same map everytime i queue up.

14570,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI was enjoying this game, but pay to win loot boxes have earned this game an instant delete, and I wont be coming back. There is no ""fine tuning"" that will make loot boxes an OK business model. There is no ""coming back"" from introducing loot boxes. It's predatory and preys on people with gambling addictions or obbsessive personalities. I look forward to it being made illegal. until then,♥♥♥♥♥♥off loot boxes.UPDATE: My gaming group just deleted it as well, none of us support loot boxes or the developers who use them. Try making a good game and selling it for a fair price instead of this nonsense. Remember when that was the goal of a software developer? We do.I am so glad I didn't buy any characters, I was just about to as well, I had been waiting for a project to finish before really getting into this game.

4305,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewHistory of robocraft:The Good Old Days:A long long time ago, when this game was fun to play, you used to get robo points to buy parts and tech points to research new parts - this was awesome, a sense of progression. Weapons were well balanced in their associated environments (e.g. SMG's did wonders at close range, with plasmas being effective barrage weapons and rails sniping off crucial parts etc.)The era of Megabots was ushered in, providing tantalising new content for veteren players and something to really look forward to for newer ones. The game was still fun, didnt feel like a grind and premium simply gave faster levels for more CPU and more robo and tech points - it was essentially pay to grind less.Now:I'd like to start off with a good point, then name the bad points in the middle and finish with some good points to represent what this game is now: A Turd Sandwich.+ Beautiful game that inspires creativity- Hackers are now present- If you dont have Premium, you will die of old age before you can afford one of the shamefully OP legendary weapons- Lost all sense of Progression- People spamming the chat begging people to buy their robots from factory+ Air Doge is funny░░░░░░░░░░░█▀▀░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▀▀▀▀░░░░░█▄▄░░░░░░░░░░█░█░░░░░░░░░░▐░░░ ░░░░░░▐▐░░░░░░░░░▄░▐░░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░▄▀▀░▐░░░ ░░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░▐░▄▄▀░░░░ ░░▄▀░░░▐░░░░░█▄▀░▐░░░░░ ░░█░░░▐░░░░░░░░▄░█░░░░░ ░░░█▄░░▀▄░░░░▄▀▐░█░░░░░ ░░░█▐▀▀▀░▀▀▀▀░░▐░█░░░░░ ░░▐█▐▄░░▀░░░░░░▐░█▄▄░░░ ░░░▀▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░-- Freejam --░░░░░░░░░",0

9729,Shop Heroes,2016.0,Awesome with cross platform support. Some hassle to get accounts connected but seem less when do. A huge time sink. Can easily spends hours just clicking everything and going from one timer to a next. Defiantly need to join an active city to get full experience. Me and friend leveled our together until 20s but when joined a bigger one together really opened things up for us. However getting the bonuses for upgrading a building became less because of that. The bad is the crafting system late game. When you need 2 good items of previous recipe. And for that one you need a few combined items of another previous... just adds up. And you have pay for the queued crafting slots. Worst is when an item requires a blue quality but max you can make is green.

6498,PlanetSide 2,2017.0,"When I first played PS2, I did not care for the large open landscape and the lack of battle. Well, that was before I actually played enough to get into a fire fight. Picture this, you are out in an outpost. No enemy in the area,  just you and your pals hanging around and bored. You hear gunfire in the distance and think, okay just an enemy squad or a sniper. You'd be wrong when an entire platoon of infantry and tanks comes rolling down the road, opening fire on you and your friends as you scramble to get a turret or find cover from the tanks blasting at you. This game can go from ""meh"" to ""holy hell where is a medic!"" on the drop of a dime. The battles are intense, the class loadouts are fair and the maps are fu**ing huge! You do not want to be caught on foot while traversing the large landscape of this game. Of course the game allows in-game purchases with Daycash, but also allows you to purchase the same items with in-game currency as you level up. There are no weapons that can win the war, all of them balance eachother out. Vehicles are difficult to destroy, that is the only thing I see as a pain. But then again, it is a fu**ing tank! So grab some freinds, grab a vehicle and prepare for one hell of a fight. This game gets two thumbs up from me!",1

1437,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"I'm not sure If I should recommend it or not. But, Im sure it needs new content.I've played this game for 9 months on mobile. You need to give a birth, new content people. All my dwellers got destroyed by radroaches, mole rats, scorpions, many times. Even tho i had power armors, gatling laser, miniguns, fatman(MIRV). Raiders arent even a problem. Death Claws cant kill all of the dwellers because they are not strong enough againts Power Armor and Gatling Laser etc. But those little MOLE RATS and Scorpions?! They've destroyed by vault many times. They are even more powerful than deathclaws wtf man? And upgrading your fortified vault door for nothing? You could add turrets, robots, new menu and content to that! Like you can customize it? Turrets, spikes, buff to the dwellers inside, getting money from putting a trader inside the vault door and stuff I dunno. Or decreasing the chances of enemy raid. It is still the same game after the long time except explorers now can get into some ""cool"" secret places. Where you will get killed mostly if you dont give enough stimpacks like me. Full em up mates because you wont be able to kill some radroaches, mole rats and feral ghouls in those ""cool"" secret places while your explorer can kill death claws, Centaurs, Feral ghoul reaver, Fire ant soldier and scorpions exploring!Anyway, If any of the developers are reading this(and I think they wont), add some new content to the vault like turrets, robots and stuff. Upgrading your door is just useless. It feels so empty. And having radscorpions attack 6 times in a row? That is nasty you know. Fix your animation bug on the fitness too. What the hell mates they are glitching like a prop in garry's mod! Jeez. Its a small little game with small animation. Even I can make a game like that mates(Hire me ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)).

2324,VEGA Conflict,2018.0,"vega conflict is a game of strategy and time lol needless to say mostly all u do is farm and upgrade....there are many ways to play this game though, you can go solo or with an alliance... It is fun to be in a guild alliance whatever u wanna call it. The game has good sound effects and a good soundtrack. Its pretty trippy soundtrack actually u can just zone out on the different planets and whatnot... The game is great is you have alot of time and you enjoy social games where u can play with an alliance or solo if you dont like the social aspect. Overall the game is well made with its different types of fleets and weaponry :) There is only one thing i do not like about the game and that is alot of people pay to win in it. Coining in the game has gotten big.... The game can be played for free, and it has events in which u can win various different blueprints for ships etc. I am enjoying this game thus far and would recommend it to anyone who like strategy and resource farming along with long upgrades... I would give the game a solid 7/10 as it lacks some aspects but makes up for others. The game is free what are you waiting for join me xD",1
8639,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"Nice game to play with friends. Without friends it is not that fun. At first its a bit hard to get into and it takes some time to learn it. But eventually you learn, you will make friends and find people helping you. There is nine classes to choose from or you can learn them all. All classes have different play styles. Nice maps and game modes. You can play this for fun or take it seriously. There is a lot of things to try out. You can try making your own content too.    Things I like about TF2:- art style and humour- funny characters- playing as blue medic on long payload maps- surf and rocket jumping- playing with friends- the moment when you find team work- nice maps and taunts- trying to make a map with hammerThings I don't like so much:- trading, trade window not working properly, dealing with annoying traders- when autobalance/scramble makes teams even more unbalanced - 7 scouts on our team / 7 spies on our team / 7 snipers on our team- when i would like to play scout for once and team has already 7 scouts- when the round is close to an end and everyone on team gives up and goes scoutI recommend this game, it is free and humorous.Hat.",1
16128,Creativerse,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewDate of Review: 02/11/2017Score Total: 9.7/10Graphics: 7.5/10Mechanics/Gameplay: 9/10I'm legitmentaly surprised with this game. I refused to play it for the longest time because I figured it was just another minecraft ripoff. Well here's the big deal:No there's no mods.No there's no hackers. (I've looked thoroughly for hacks)Here's what's amazing about both of these. In minecraft you need all these mods and so on just to make the game look cool or decent to your tastes and those tastes hit home on your PC and/or laptop hard. This game runs smoothly, really smoothly there's some moment of minor lag (a lot to be honest) but it's incredibly small and not an issue (at least for me.) In minecraft if you want to travel faster you're screwed from the start to grind into things less you go the cheap way with a mod or two. Here, I haven't even gotten passed Iron ore and I can actually make teleporters. The ability to traverse land is amazing because of this, and if you buy the pro pack like I did, and I HIGHLY recommend it. If not for the glider, for the transportation ease, for the extra stamina, even bag space.. Just go for travel luxury. The map isn't procedurial generated. It's not as massive as Planetside 2 or Minecraft. But it IS HUGE. It'll take you the better part of an hour to get from edge to edge.Biomes, diversity in mobs and difficulty curves to match, the feeling that you don't have to walk from edge to edge but can fast travel in teleporters. The game real has a lot of potential and is hitting home runs on everything. The game has a fair community, not a big one by any means. But they're there, 24/7 too and playing this game really stimulates you. It's minecraft on hard and easy mode. The mobs keep you on your toes, the progression system is absolutely brilliant and scales you into horror. Got a pickaxe that's stone, congratz you can mine up into the next level no further. That simple stopping point is epic. It stops people from going in over their heads, being smart and gearing up for every mine shaft and cave they venture into. This game knows how to keep you on edge.Extremely recommended!",1
353,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,"This new update 1.12: deploy, drive, wait for a respawn has unfortunately made this game suck for everyone. The new damage update makes every vehicle a god at absorbing bullets and shells(even when destroying as many components as possible). Spawncamping is being encouraged now due to the maintenance timer... (only viable thing to do is run starter weapons if you get spawncamped). The new driving physics makes cars go 20 km/h offroad while getting catapulted to 100km/h on roads, you never want to touch your brake button as that activates some sort of airplane level brakes that kill all your speed in a second. Cornering is impossible due to you powersliding round a corner when holding the gas, you just not making the turn when just steering or doing a grandma where you drive round the corner with no speed at all. The sound is broken now aswell to the point where i can't pinpoint sounds anymore where before i could.And oh the tank physics, good luck getting up hills/mountains.I've been actively playing the game for 2 years now and i really enjoyed it before this update, too bad they had to release this update in this form.

The dialogues are just silent with only the background music and gestures, making me a little bored after frequent readings. I hope that Aeria games can add voices to this game.If you want to play it for fun, just choose the free version like I do. Sometimes, there're also official events that can grant you free but awesome stuff that deserves your attention.

19251,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst off, I'd like to point out I have spent 40+ hours in this game so far, which isn't much for that genre but is still enough to see what the game has to offer. I usually don't review games in Early Access and try to avoid writing ""pros & cons"" reviews, but in this case I don't see how it can be avoided... So here we go!PROS:* fast-paced like Hearthstone, an average game lasts 5 minutes (maybe 8 if one of you is struggling somehow, it's very rare to draw your whole deck)* free-to-play and quick to unlock (I've unlocked 20 to 40% of each expansion in about 40 hours, and I have enough to buy 8 packs)* puzzles, gauntlet,... basically enough modes to keep you playing if you're not into competitive play, and they count in daily quests to unlock more content* similar to Magic the Gathering in its core mechanics, with lots of synergies availables and pretty silly combos (especially with multicolor decks)!* deck size can go from 75 cards to 150, mana sources included... you can do a lot of silly stuff with that many cards!* an interesting approach to weapons and relics, allowing your character to take part into the fight in different ways, also allowing some synergies to become insanely stronger with the proper combo of items on your hero.* waiting in queue doesn't take too long (usually within 15 seconds), I've never had to wait more than 40 seconds for a game to start (including week days, late hours and such)CONS:* I hated the mana management in MtG, so I hate it here... Most of my complaints about this game are about mana management. I just hope devs would NOT have included mana as cards, because most of the time we are drawing too many of them (or too few), and we just sit there looking at each other until something playable comes up. It's VERY frustrating to lose a game for not being able to play it at all (or win against an opponent with an empty board for 6+ turns), just because you drew nothing of value for many consecutive turns. With only 40 hours in this game, I'm already starting to see a pattern where I'll draw up to 20 mana cards in a row (...yes, 20! I counted!) and lose without having anything to play. The opposite is also true: cards to play but stuck at 2 mana for 10 turns, and my opponent just unleashes a♥♥♥♥♥♥storm in my face. Even the AI in Gauntlet tends to lose for not being able to play anything! There is little to no randomness in this game, but the way mana is managed is just HORRIBLE and breaks gameplay completely... In the end I think it's what will make me leave eventually, I would much rather see the power meter increased each turn rather than having to draw mana sources. I've noticed that issue has been noticed many times before me, any search online will show you countless pages specifically about that.* you are forced to use mana sources in your deck (at least one third!), which basically means you HAVE to include at least 25 cards out of 75 just for mana, without counting alternative sources (units increasing power, units drawing mana, multicolor monuments, etc...). In the end, in any deck you create, you have at least 30-35 cards spent just on mana alone. It's really not easy to optimize your deck building when mana is forced into the deck: in MtG I would usually manage mana with alternative sources, specifically to avoid having to draw lots of terrain and wasting turns on bad draws.* you can't skip most card animations, cutscenes, scripted turns in puzzles, etc... basically leading to a significant amount of time lost to things that won't matter once you've seen them once (especially when retrying a puzzle). In the other hand, some cards you don't know have so much text that you don't have time to read them as your opponent plays them. The history of played cards is not as complete or easy to read as in Hearthstone, which sometimes leads to confusing turns where you're being outplayed and have no clue why or how.* it's using the same system as MtG, units will heal at the end of your turn. If you build a deck accordingly, minions with high health are virtually indestructible and will prevent any damage from the enemy board. Silencing units won't reset their attack/health to the default values, it only applies to specific buffs so you can make some units ridiculously strong and nothing will pass through. I didn't like that core mechanic in MtG and it also applies here, even more so that you can build entire synergies making all units on board gain effects, strength, and/or health almost every turn. There is actually an achievement in the game when you get 999+ HP, and I have taken a couple screenshots in Gauntlet runs where my minions had 970+ attack (individually!) and about the same amount of health... Remember that I have played this game for about 40 hours only, and imagine how broken some synergies must be when you enter the highest levels of competitive play...CONCLUSION:This is a very interesting game with a lot of potential, but because it tries to copy too much on already existing games without fixing their flaws, it ends up being very frustrating (or repetitive once you've managed to build an insane deck) and you feel like there is not much you can do about it. I would recommend playing it for a while just to have a good look at it and have fun while it lasts, but in the end I don't think you will want to spend real money or even keep playing for years. It's sad to say, but because it doesn't fix the issues of MtG and doesn't succeed in entertaining as much as Hearthstone (or Duelyst, Gwent, Shardbound... you name it!), this game is just ""another MtG clone""...",0

18572,Star Trek Online,2017.0,FAST level up if you do the quests and duty officer stuff. The space stuff is fun but the Easter egg hunts-- I mean away missions-- are uber grindy and repetitive.

570,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewBack in the day of Robo-Craft's beta, it adopted the gameplay of the popular World of Tanks game; two 15-tank teams, no respawns, a capture point at each team's spawn, 10 tiers for tanks, and a xp based leveling system.  For a long while, things got better. They added an origanal new gamemode, mega-bots, wings, and other smaller things. Soon though, it all went downhill. They removed everything that the game was. They alienated their long time players. What they have done to the game will ultimatly become it's downfall.I got the beta years ago and had several hundered hours on the standalone launcher and later 160 more hours through Steam. I'll never play a single minute of this dissapointment of a game again. ",0

I recommend this game specially to people that have the possibility of playing with friends. This is a team-based experience, and it's really frustrating to try to play cooperatively with random people, a lot of which are quite toxic. It's very easy to get a trapped in a loop of playing over and over and finding out that you're actually enjoying just a few of multiple matches. That's why I recommend everybody interested to play only with friends if possible. It can easily get very stressful and a time-waster.",1

I will play the game and upgrad with what I earn by playing. Can't believe I haven't known about this game till now. I would love to see games like this but themed for Star Wars or Battle Star Galactica and what not. That would be amazing. I highly recommend this game.,1
1701,Paladins®,,"you're looking at this game thinking ""Oh huh, an Overwatch knockoff"", I strongly advise not letting that idea convince you not to try this game. While there undoubtedly similarities (and even direct inspirations) to many of the Overwatch heroes, this game is pretty different when you get down to the technical side of things.The way I see it, this game is a more approachable game than Overwatch. Not only that, but the Ability selections, Loadout cards and in-game credit shop allow for a more customizable experience in terms of finding characters and playstyles you enjoy. Want more sustain? Equipt health and healing oriented cards. Want an ability more readily available? Equipt cooldown reduction cards. The cards are often low percentages, but you can invest points in a card that you like and increase the impact it has.On top of this, gamemodes are manually chosen and queued for, so you aren't forced to play a mode that you don't particularly enjoy. The option to swap between first and third person on the fly is also a nice touch.That being said, if you were looking to play the Ranked draft mode, I strongly recommend you stay away from it. Currently, the results of your placements can toss you anywhere between Bronze and Diamond, just based on your win/loss rate and the rank of the players you win/lose against. Even once you have placed, you will gain/lose points based on your win/loss ratio. With no consideration for personal performance, you are looking at a system that will punish you the second you go on a losing streak.All in all, if you are looking for a fun, MOBA-style shooter to play casually with friends, I strongly recommend you give this game a try. Just stay away from Ranked for the time being.",1

If you are used to Hearthstone's super simplistic resource method, this game is not for you.

As much as it feels so sweet when you see the same thing happen to enemy ships... oh the giggles when they finally pop.The maps are nice as far as I can tell after just a few hours of gameplay. Navigating between asteroids, ducking in cover behind anything that the environment offers: neat stuff! (yeah, try to ""duck for cover"" with ships that huge)Gameplay? It's FUNFUNFUN! As far as my PvP matches go, a big chunk of the community is friendly and helpful. Really appreciate that! A smaller part is pretty quiet, but I prefer the quiet ones over the toxic ones (I experienced in some well-known tank game) anytime :)I can't really tell at the moment, but a gut feeling tells me this is NOT p2w. I got myself the armada pack, but as far as I experienced you can get your butt handed to you in any ship if your opponent is just more experienced, so I think there's nothing like this one ""UBER"" ship that has the ""I win"" button installed.I really do like this game.

Tanks are pretty much just giant indestructable insta kill sniper rifles, and noone has AT so they tend to just ♥♥♥♥ up the entire game.

Graphical style of Hearthstone and complexity of Magic the Gathering all in one. Cards are well designed and very interesting. Game is quite generous for cards and packs. There are many game modes, including a true draft format. My only complaint is that game has the ancient stupid land (sigil in this) based mana system of Mtg, so be prepared to be mana screwed or flooded occasionally. Hearthstone's simple but effective mana system is simply better.",1

All the way up to $99 for a years worth of VIRTUAL fishing... You can fish in 2 spots on 1 lake for free at first. EDIT: Apparently with the exp you earn you can eventually gain the in-game currency and buy the licenses to fish elsewhere. But the exp was updated and nerfed so low that this is an absolute GRINDFEST. And that lake gets old and boring very fast, as well as the .5 lb Bluegill. Also the menus are a mess. If you have the virtual money to buy something it can still be blacked out with no explanation as to why...Multiplayer is NOT implemented at this time.

(Very hard to do much with a non-functioning team)-Punishing deserter penalty in casual games. (Failure to accept a found match or select a character within the alloted time grants you a large cooldown: 15 minutes or more)-No voice chat and in game chat has a problem with cut-off text after typing a long sentence or so.-Certain players experience issues of their game crashing, Black screen, unable to start the game after pressing Play in client (Uninstall Avast, kill off the anti-cheat and the Hi Rez Client and relaunch it, or restart your computer are some methods that may help)-Takes quite a bit of time to qualify for ranked (Requires 12 Champions to be at level 4 or higher) ",1

Incredibly enjoyable to play with your best friends. There is infinite replayability. The levels randomly regenerate when you revisit them and the graphics are incredibly detailed.

I'd recommend that if you are going to pay for anything, just get the all access full bundle. Is this game worth $50.00? My personal opinion, no. No its not. If it went on sale for say $34.99, I would buy it. And thinking about it, I think buying it all really might take away from the game. A lot of enjoyment comes from mastering each gun, spending a few hours working with each one. Seeing your name near the top of the leaderboard (Daily for me, of course =D) is really rewarding. If I had the hundred plus guns to play with, I don't know if I would put all my efforts into learning just one gun at a time, resulting in me not getting as good with each gun.

Your chessboard is old and warped, and some of the pieces are starting to lose their paint, but who cares? You two have great fun.

It just so happens that neither you nor your friend very much care for checkers. Sure, you'd play it from time to time, but you'd much rather just play chess.However, your friend suggests that perhaps you should both just give checkers a chance. ""Alright,"" you say to yourself, ""This isn't so different than how it was before. I can deal with this."" However, upon closer inspection, there aren't enough checker pieces to even play the game properly, and some of them don't even seem to belong to the same set as the rest. You are about to open your mouth to complain, but before you can, the person who destroyed your wonderful chess set pulls down their pants and just craps all over your board.

However, and this important -- while Cygames has copied most of the look and feel, they've also created enough different keywords and game mechanics that it's not just a reskinned version of Hearthstone. This is a different situation from that Hex TCG that basically took Magic: The Gathering and just changed all the names.If you're already deep into Hearthstone, there isn't really much here that might entice you to switch. Maybe if you prefer the style, which is anime through-and-through (complete with bad English dubbing). But if you're new to CCGs, this is a good F2P title for you -- there aren't that many cards yet, so you're less likely to be overwhelmed, and won't need to grind/pay as much to catch up to veteran players.",1

19112,Elsword,2014.0,"    XD here with a brief review of the game Elsword and strongly recomend this game to anyone who likes adventuring socializing, talking and trading items. Also, who don't mind spending a few dollars on customising and upgrading the character or characters they plan on using later on in the game. This game is a side strolling 3D beat em up japanese anime game with real-time fighting doing combo combinations while using spells and magic moves and skills in your repithior to defeat your enermies. You can also use skill points to unlock new skills and new moves as you progess through the game and get stronger meaning that you and somebody else could have the same character but could fight in totaly different ways and set different  skill moves to manipulate his/her character the way they see fit. Each character has his/her storyline of why they are here and their porpose of fighting which you would find out more of if you decide to try this game which i personally think you won't put down when get heads and tails of things :). I just a few months ago tried the game myself and today still play it because there are so many things in the game that you can do and new things and great deals and oppertunities get added to the game on a regular basis. Plus you can hang out in this game with your friends form parties and/or groups together talk, trade, socialize in real-time go in dungeons together or solo talk and stratigize while fighting with your friends in real-time. Or if you got to go or stop playing for a while for what ever reason can withdraw from the group/party at anytime with the push of a button on your character's personal social option. Plus they start you off with ten resurrection stones and a long bar of life when you first start off and a combo list for your character that you can improve on as you level up and progress though the game. At the beginning of the game you can choose the character you want to figh as and that character's storyline will begin after you put your personal user name in to identify yourself in the game. If it turns out that you don't like that character you could make up to four characters or four of the same characters in anyway you see fit. From the clothes they wear to the way they fight, you controll it all. Or you could chose the character you don't want any more and press delete the game would then ask you: ""Are you sure you want to delete the character?"" Click yes and the character will be deleted no and the character will be spared. In my opinion, this game is one of the best  games i have ever played and am in it for the long-hall/run they people in this game will get tired of seeing me and say ""oh there gos XD again."" Also, after customising your character putting your moves together and learn your skills you can challege your friends and other people online in tournaments that gives you prises, sparring sessions and practice sessions for fun and to develope your realtime fighting skills that you can level up by appling SP/SkillPoints that you get when you level up from beating dungeons. There are different areas to too each with different materials you need to craft new weapons, amor and clothes, you will find out more about this in the game. Anyways, that's some of the basic things you can do in this game if interested you should give i a try and might end up liking the game more than me. :)                                                                                                                       From XD Big fan of Elsword",1

2308,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis is legit the BEST royale style gaming experience on the market. I recommend duo with snowboard to all of my friends as this is THE game I would play with you when we're gaming together.,1
6946,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe gameplay isn't very good to begin with, the matchmaking is completely unbalanced, crafting your robot is even ruined with the terrible RNG crate system, which was either put in place in an attempt to make the game worse or an attempt to squeeze more money out of its player base with what is essentially gambling. On top of that is the premium membership, which ties in with the crate system and the crafting system to squeeze out even more money from its player base. Premium membership isn't a one time buy, it requires a subscription like an MMO. The subscription options range from a few days to six months. After every match you get a crate with some items. Better types of crates have a higher chance for rarer items, you get better crates from being higher on the scoreboard and on the winning team in a match. You get more items per crate depending on the type of match you play. Match types that generally take longer give more items. The items you get are completely random. And if you're not a premium member you only get half of the items per crate, so if you happen to get a good item in a locked off row and you're not premium, it's gone. This is of course meant to encourage people to pay for premium, but it's more likely to just drive players away from the game.Even with premium (which I had for 3 days) you mostly get garbage, even after hours and hours of grinding the same poorly balanced match types over and over again. There is a way to get more crates without grinding for hours though, of course you can buy them with real life money. So if you want to get a lot of items, some of which would hopefully be good, you can pay for a few days of membership, then pay for several of the highest tier crates, then hope you get something you actually want. On top of that most of the paint colors are restricted to premium members only. So if you want to paint your robot anything other than white, dark gray, light blue, and orange, then you've got to pay for premium.Of course you don't have to pay for anything, you could go on just playing the game. But that leads to the worst part yet. The game play. The movement feels clunky and the combat is bad. By that I mean weapons, at least the ones you start with, have terrible accuracy, especially at long range. This can still be sort of enjoyable when you're up against robots with similarly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons, but like I said there's no balance in the matchmaking. Any weapon/part goes for any game mode. They only match based on the robot's CPU score. Each item has a CPU cost, stronger/rarer weapons have a slightly higher CPU cost than weaker basic weapons. However if you build your robot with just the basics, like a helicopter rotor attached to a powerful missile launcher (the missiles lock on by the way) or a rail gun to a few blocks flat on some wheel's/treads/whatever, you can easily get matched with new players using robots with much weaker weapons which most likely can't even hit you reliably from the range you're hitting them. Another common annoyance is people using small, fast robots which hover or fly around you firing some sort of homing weapons, which mean their robot can constantly be moving quickly and erratically while always hitting you because they don't have to worry about aiming. And even if you do land a lucky hit, they'll just heal fully if they don't get hit again within ten seconds. While you probably won't be able to heal because they never miss with their homing weapons constantly chipping away at you. The only real way to counter this would be to build a similar robot assuming you have the parts. Even if you did though, does that seem like fun? A bunch of people just mindlessly flying around holding down the left mouse button until one team wins. Not exactly great gameplay.Even if all of that sounds good to you, the only way to get better weapons and parts is to keep playing these poorly balanced matches over and over again for hours till you hopefully get the parts you want/need. Or until you get enough garbage to “recycle” for anything from less than 1% to about 30% or 40% of what each of your items is worth (destroying your items in the process of course) then finally getting enough in game currency from all that crap you spent all that time grinding for to finally afford some of the ridiculously expensive items from the in game shop. You can do all of that to see if maybe the game gets a bit more enjoyable. Or you can just play a different game.",0
10697,Star Trek Online,2013.0,This game is really only for Trekkies. Being one myself I enjoyed this game. The idea of free roaming space while taking command of your own fleet is amazing. Although the gameplay and controls can be a little sketchy and unapealing at times the game is still fun. If your a Trekkie than I would suggest deffinatly getting this game.,1
4049,Shakes and Fidget,2016.0,I nearly spent 400 hours in this game on steam. At this point this game is getting boring after the 10th character I started to play and so the time that I have to wait when I  travel  ( in game ) BUT this game got me from the begining maybe cause of the graphics  or the way you have to play it.,1
10108,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewLook I’m going to start off by saying the PR approach for this game was extremely bad. Take the criticism as it comes it will help you develop a better game.Gameplay in itself is okay if not a tad outdated. However questing is extremely broken and test translations felt like a google translate rather than someone actually translating it. Voice acting for this game is lacking, voices are emotionless and somewhat can add a little cringe factor there needs to be more emotion in the voice acting it feels like they are repeating the same lines over and over again getting bored.All in all this is still in early access and it’s pretty unpolished for something to be released to the public as a closed/paygate beta.Another thing before buying a founders pack is that you need to know that all your specials are one character only so pick carefully, to be honest though it’s quite a rip off with that case.Should you buy it now? Simple answer is no, wait another couple of months to let them have a chance at fixing it.",0

4371,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI've anticipated Bless for a while now. I've followed it and been aware that this was it's 4th relaunch and 2nd rebuild but I still went ahead and gave it a try. I rolled a pally yesterday and mashed buttons through the tutorial since the name of the tactic your supposed to mount for pally's isn't correct at all. I then went out and experienced almost all the bugs you can find here on reddit.Poor frame-rates in city, though, when I dropped the graphics settings to 1 it ran mostly smooth. Quests that ""Failed to destroy item"" (I'm assuming remove it from my character) and hence not allowing me to move on. Loading screens I would have to force close 4-5 times in a row before I could play. When they brought the servers down I went and did the .ini changes and could up my graphics to '3' again. However, that made the loading screen boss more powerful.Despite all that I was having some fun with the game and managed to play for several hours. But as I struggled past the loading screen for the 5th time and pondered over text to strengthen my Endurance skill (maybe?) and told the umpteenth new paladin that ""Hesitation tactics"" or whatever was really ""Interruption tactics"". I suddenly got mad.Why?Why was the game like this on their 4th relaunch. And why was I supporting a game that was like this on it's 4th relaunch. I'm about to launch my own game and I spent hours on the phone with an alpha tester I sent it to specifically because they have a masters in education and I knew they'd proofread everything! And I was right they did, and helped me fix and clarify a lot of text in my game.Now my game isn't on the scope of this game by any means. It's a personal project done over several years. But I could and would and did take the time to make sure it had a decent level of polish when it's not even my day job (I'm a web developer normally not a game developer).So it made me think why do I want to support this company whose job it was to make sure this stuff was correct? Even if I'm having fun, they clearly don't care enough about their own product to make sure it has a level of polish it needs not to be disgraceful... If I wasn't going to demand quality with my money when would I ever get quality? So I logged off my paladin, went over to Steam and asked for a refund.It wasn't that I wasn't having fun with Bless, it wasn't that I couldn't figure out the Engrish, it was simply that I decided to demand more of a company who's job it was to actually produce the game.",0

Good items are very rare and hard to obtain, Unless you spend money.Majority of the comminity are old returning players with life subs that come back to complain, do a few dailies and log out.

The reporting system does not seem to deal with this. I suggest a social ranking which is used for public match making as well as mmr. Social ranking could be determined as a function of commends v reports.Supports: I play supports almost exclusively. The reason is that if I dont I cant rely on anyone else to. I spend a lot gold on support items at the expense of developing my hero. It is a grind. Because I regularly play supports my level almost always lags behind others so I will rarely see a lot of the new high level options. The new changes do little to make playing a support more enjoyable. Wards should be free and on a timer.Map change: I hate the new map. Visibility is reduced, wards are less effective, it will become a gankers paradise since you cannot ward as effectively. For a prodominently support player who normally takes the role of hard carry baby sitter that is not a prospect I like.EDIT:Snowballing. Talents will accelerate snowballing. My suspicion is that means that the team that handles the transfer from laning phase to ganking phase most efficiently will have a significant advantage.

3381,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2018.0,"This is one of the best Yu-Gi-Oh! video games available!  The speed duel format, variety of cards/decks, and playable characters from the anime series makes this game worth playing.  Notably, the nostalgia factor really comes from the characters when dueling with their anime personalities, summoning of their ace monsters, and oodles of references to the anime series themselves.  Each character has a set of skills that can be used during the duel, and some are quite reflective to their individual characteristics and/or seen use in the anime proper.

From there, you will fight your way across the continent and find what's behind the corruption of the land. To do this, you use skill gems that you can socket into your equipment, different kinds of orbs that enchant your stuff and spend points in a massive passive skill tree. The skill tree in this game provides very few skills, because the majority is available as skill gems (that you can swap in/out at a moment's notice).I didn't try to use the global chat (too noisy), so can't really tell if the online aspect is good or not.",1

12739,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewPros. 1. A unique game with a fair amount of weapons. 2. The weapons are balanced ok at the moment. 5/20/2016 (see con 4)Cons.1. Spawning is inconvinent at best, you can spawn right infront of an enemy and vice versa. 2. Premium is too expensive. 3. You can get the most kills and do the most damage while dying the least and you will somehow lose, a very unintuitive scoring system. This occurs even when your account is premium. 4. Constant updates alienate veteran players.Verdict: It's free-to-play, keep it that way for yourself.",0

No.After the 5th reinstall, I had enough and created a virtual PC where I could play finally play.Now, after spending this much time trying to only set up the game, I was very dissapointed.

105,GUNS UP!,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewBasically, I was forced to write this analysis because I could not play with the uneasiness of having informed about this game to other users who are interested in the game. I would only explain it with a pencil: Perfect. Not only for the gameplay, graphics and functions of this game knowing that it is an early access.I would only put 2 handles:1ยบ- The first glue is on the subject of cosmetics for your soldiers. I mean the difficulty of getting a simple helmet. I propose that cosmetics be obtained, in addition to the boxes, winning battles in which you have destroyed the enemy tents. I think it makes a lot of sense, that is, if the army soldiers sleep in the tents, I do not think they sleep with their helmets on ... Well, it must also be said that this game has a lot of fiction in the realism theme, but At least try to supplement that.I mean when you destroy ALL the enemy tents give you one or several random helmets.By the way, yesterday I opened a box and touched the Stanhelm, a helmet that I was dying to have.But the problem is that the issue of just being able to put it to a soldier does not seem right.That greatly limits the personalization of the army. And as you say, every user is unique.But it's hard to make your army unique with this option.2ยบ- Recruitment prices. I think some prices are pretty steep. For example, recruiting a flamethrower unit costs, if I am not mistaken, 150,000 ammunition. Or another example, the Command, which costs 225,000. Let's see, I'm not saying that you reduce all prices, I mean that you overreach the excessive prices.Well that's it. I have to say that this game is very good to be an Advance Access.As I say with other games, I think this game has a future.By the way, the game has been recommended by the user davisito23, in case you will give him some kind of reward.I recommend this game.",1
2139,Magic Duels,2016.0,"This review is coming from someone who has never played paper Magic. My MTG experience started with DoTP 2015.  I will say, the most awesome part of these games is that they introduced me to the world of MTG. I had no idea of the depth of story and how everything fit together. With that said, I likely will never get into paper Magic past the lore. That endevor will just take too much of my time. Life is simply too busy. As far as Magic Duels itself, I do enjoy it, but I'm hesitant to recommend it to others. It feels like Magic Duels is a game put together by a few dedicated highschool kids in their free time. Overall the quality of the interface is not very polished. There are a few glitches here and there, as well as some interesting features left out from previous iterations (hold priority just to name one). The biggest issue I have is that I would feel much better with some sort of account system. Currently I have not spent any money on this game because I feel that if I needed to format my computer for any reason I would lose all progress. I'd feel much more secure in spending money if I had this confidence. Another big deal for me, though not quite as big, is that I cannot play on Android. If I was able to apply the same account to both my PC and Android device I would have no problem throwing plenty of money at this game, even in its unpolished state.I do enjoy playing Magic Duels and will continue to play it. I probably won't spend any money until the major issues listed above are addressed. Here's hoping. I also cannot recommend anyone else spend money on this game if I myself cannot.",0
346,War Thunder,2014.0,"Wanna play a real World War 2 flying simulator then give War Thunder a go. The air combat is fantastic and amazing. However, The game has some serious flaws. 1. There is a soft RP cap, meaning if you get a victory and like 13 tank kills, with premium, you will still earn about 6,000 rp! This is rediculous and makes grinding, the main thing you play for, horrendous. 2. They have abandoned the air for the game, which is what the game was founded upon. 3. The ships closed beta is utter garbage and the gameplay is terrible and I believe they have abandoned it.4. The new helicopters are an unfinished cash grab. Terrible flight models and damage models.5. They refuse to keep fun and engaging gamemodes. The Enduring confrontation game mode is amazing, but only shows up every so many months. Also their infamous World War mode is still in testing and in the past 5 months they have manage to make only very few advances in updating it.I keep coming back to play this game, because I have always loved it. But after so many hours and money sunk in, Gaijin has not lived up to my expectations and I feel like they have abandoned this game.",0

Digimon RPG, a game made in 2004, has better graphics and much much better gameplay than this.

11129,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,"Absolutely awesome game! A great range of classes to choose from. Scout is a fast running class that is mostely used for doing the map objective (capture the flag, pushing cart) and just generally annoying people. Soldier is a slow moving class armed with a rocket launcer, a shotgun, and a entrenching tool (shovel) soldier is one of the main damage dealers in team fortress 2. The Pyro is a masked psycho armed with a flame thrower, a shotgun, and a fire axe. Pyro is again a main damage dealer but instead he/she uses his/hers flame thrower to burn enemies alive. The Demolitions Man (demo man) is much like the soldier with explosive weapons instead a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher (manually exploded bombs that stick to walls etc)and a bottle! The demoman is a main damage dealer aswell but used as a defence class because of his sticky bomb launcher to make traps he is also very drunk! xD. The Heavy weapons guy is as you guess, a guy with big♥♥♥♥♥weapons! he carries a minigun, a shotgun and uses his fists to punch people! Heavy is the God of damage dealing, he can kill all the other classes quite easily, but be careful! Heavy is a very slow class and is quite vulnerable to take damage from behind!The engineer. The engineer is a defence class that creates Sentry guns to defend, he can upgrade his sentry 3 times. level 1 being a normal sentry, level 2 being two chainguns on the side and level 3 with a rocket launcher on the top!The medic is the support class healing his teammates who are in need of help, the medic is the second fastest class in team fortress 2 he also has a thing called Uber charge, which is you and the person you're healing have a few seconds of invulnerability. The sniper is a long ranged Damage dealer he uses a powerful Sniper rifle, a SMG and a machete the sniper can take out most classes in a quickshot however you can keep scoped in to fill a meter which makes your shots more powerful, when this meter is full you can take out a heavy in one shot in the head! The spy is a very different class... The silent assassin, the spy carries a revolver, a knife and a electro-sapper the electro-sapper is used for destroying enemy engineer's sentry guns although the engineer can destroy these sappers that doesn't mean that you can't backstab him! an important role in the spy is to backstab people with your knife to instantly kill your target the spy has the ability to make himself temporarily invisible and has the ability to disguise as the enemy team to fool them! That is all the classes in team fotress 2! I hope this review was helpful and i hope to see you on a server! Good bye-Jarhead",1

Once you can actually beat medium or hard 90% of the time u will find out that the 10 or 15 coins u get for winning are actually really bad considering the amount of time u are putting into just winning 10 or 15 coins.- Even if u win all the time it would take a considerable amount of time to get all the cards.- There is a ""grind-limit"": you can only get a certain amount of coins per day, then u have to wait 24h to be able to grind again.

15076,War Thunder,2016.0,"If you love outstanding physics, intense tank battles, realistic mechanics and incredible gameplay....Then you came to the wrong game. Welcome to War Thunder, please insert money to continue. For some reason the developers seem to think Russia and Germany won WWII as the bias in this game would suggest we should all have pencil mustaches and be slapping each other with lederhosen. I've done my best to enjoy this game, but through the constant aneurisms of unfair matches and special education teammates who enjoy driving into you and team killing, it's somewhat impossible to do so. I've seen plenty of reviews of angry players who resemble 12 year old Xbox Live children angry they can't get a kill, however don't take this review as such. The game REQUIRES some sort of payment to make the game enjoyable. If you enjoy watching paint dry, then boy will you enjoy waiting for your tanks to finally research! But have no fear, the waiting does NOT end there, as you need to pay in game currency to train a crew to operate that tank you spent your entire adult life researching.But if that doesn't tickle your belly button, then don't worry, I have more good news! Those tanks you spend eternity researching will still never stand a chance against the players you're matched against who seem to be far ABOVE your level, so the excitement of researching a bad*** tank is short lived as you're eiffel towered by tanks 3 ranks above you (or by players who stole their parents credit card to purchase the Pay 2 Win tanks!) This includes having to take 50 shots at a single tank to get a penetration, but if you drive over a rock, prepare to spend 50+ seconds to repair!But the GREATEST part about war thunder is their servers. Plenty of PING to go around! The developers must run the game from a shack somewhere on the forest moon of Endor, as you'll find yourself huffing tank fumes from players who killed you before you even loaded the map. HOWEVER! ""If you do pay for premium,"" your tanks seem to become empowered with the magic of capitalism as you breeze through research....oh crap I ran out of premium already...as their system charges you by DAY instead of the typical monthly payment. Be prepared to install an arcade coin slot to your PC to keep your benefits coming, because the moment they run out, the game progresses slower than an African Sloth trying to climb Mount Everest.So grab your friends! (but not more than 3 because they limit your squad to 4 people.) and huff some glue, because the amount of braincells you'll sacrifice lose from doing THAT is MINISCULE to the amount you'll lose to broken physics, monkey run match making and confusing deaths (walls don't wall properly in this game).

6285,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI was starting to think this would be the battle royale game to really take over, knock Fortnite from its throne and all that. The requirement of having a kill to forge legendary weapons meant there was real incentive to quickly go to a populated and dangerous area to get a powerful reward if you survived. Weapon sounds and bolts felt different and interesting, skill-based, fair, satisfying to land. The different classes and abilities were fun, if not entirely balanced, but the chicken mechanic kept me lovin it.Then with the newest update they made all hitboxes the same for the different guns, changed all the different bolts to the same boring, androgynous blue money shot. Legendary weapons are no longer forged, but picked up completely at random (genious!). It's not even that it's less fun now, it's that it's not fun *at all* with these changes. I really hope the developers realise they've ruined what was a fun and really creative take on the battle royale genre, and while I have no idea how an adult human being with an average intelligence could conceptually think of the changes as for the better, I understand even less how those changes could be playtested and put through, even in a game in such early access.

You can use crew and implants to modify a tank to deal extra damage or make a small ship much more durable than people expect.Recent changes to ship prices have made it a little harder to get some of the more dynamic ships but it doesn't take too long and encourages you to learn each one you buy.

5407,Digimon Masters Online,2018.0,"My first Steam review and its a shame it has to be a negative one. Having been a fan of the tv series 15+ years ago, I REALLY looked forward to enjoying playing this game. Bearing in mind that I've not only just recently bought my PC, I've got a Ryzen 5 1500X CPU and ASUS RX Vega 56 GPU so this game should run with the best graphics with ease. SHOULD. During gamplay, Digimon doesn't even push my Vega that hard. Unfortunately, the game decides to crash my entire PC roughly every half hour. Blue/pixelated screen followed by a reboot of the PC. This is the main reason I am unable to recommend this game. The game itself is pretty fun. The graphics are decent, digimon are great and the quest system isn't too bad. Tutorial could probably do with providing a bit more info (slots, chips, misc. items etc) and the English translations are in desperate need of proof reading and correcting. I mean come on, it doesn't cost that much to get a native english translator on the job! Pedantics and criticisms aside, this game can be anjoyable. I think it has some of the most affordable microtransactions I've seen yet. I haven't actually worked out the total cost of things like 'all inventory slots unlocked' but I'm happy to spend $1 on unlocking a few slots every so often. All in all, this is a good game, 8/10 or so. my RCA results point to the game itself causing my PC to crash. Until that is sorted, I won't be able to give this game a ""Thumbs Up"".",0
2226,Champions Online,2014.0,"This game can be a lot of fun with friends. The character creation options are very impressive. You can spend a ton of time designing a perfect hero and as you progress in the game, costume unlocks will become available to you randomly or through other means.  Along with this, the places that you can travel around are huge so if you're the kind of person that likes to travel around this is a definite plus.  With friends you can take down bosses with ease, conquer different crime organizations, and enjoy the plots your character is tied into.Without friends you can do the same, but it may not be as fun, especially with the Alert system and weekly events that take place.  Some events need good teamwork and organization to pull off, but if you don't have friends that are interested in playing or available, the community in game are more than kind enough to assist those in need.  Not only that, but the sheer amount of different appearances of heroes may spark more creativity for your character (or nemesis once you reach a certain level).The downside is that this game has a ton of costumes, devices, and most recently vehicles that will cost a pretty penny to obtain with real money. There are methods to obtain most in game, but it will require a lot of grinding for resources that is a pain.  Vehicles are probably the most annoying to try to obtain without actual cash since they reduce the time it takes to get from one end of a map to the other by at least half according to a few people, but are possibly the most difficult to get.  If you need to get to a place fast, such as a friend that is fighting a boss in the corner of the desert while you are at the south end of Canada, it will take forever to reach your friend to help without improved travel powers or a vehicle.  However, the vehicles are not required to play the game or progress your character to max level, so while it is a downside, it isn't a big one.Overall it's still a fun game to play. If you have a decent computer and like being a superhero, give it a try. If you have a friend that likes being a superhero bring them along as well. The more the merrier!",1
19241,Magic Duels,2016.0,"""You gave this a thumbs up!?""   Yes, but let me explain why. You'll see that I've only clocked 44 or so hours on this game. It's because I merely play when I have a MTG itch I need scratched. I've had this game since release and I've stopped playing online matches. You're at a disadvantage going online to duel if you don't spend a bunch of money to unlock every card. Not to mention, the game gets buggy on certain card abilities. This alone will cost you a game.     I only play Easy AI or replay some of the campaign when I scratch the itch now. I'll do the quests to get my coins and call it done. I honestly forget when the last time I used my coins was lol.OVERALL::If you're looking for something to scratch a MTG itch because your buds flaked on you, this'll do it.If you're looking for a MTG game that you can play hours every day and feel you've accomplished MTG badassery, this WON'T do it.If you're wanting to spend a bunch of your hard earned money on needless coins in order to unlock every card in this game, because you feel spending your hard earned money on real cards is a waste of time........then seek help.I'm now going to ignore this game for another few weeks or until I get that itch.",1

19261,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst of all, I ""think"" there might be potential in this game? I have a lot of friends that have bought this and have been playing since it opened up. But from my perspective, of only playing 3 hours here's what I can tell you on my initial perspective.The graphics - Ok, the animations can be a bit jerky at times, but overall everything is pretty consistent. I do like seeing decent frame rates over long distances, which is nice and the character animations are generic but good.Customization - In regards to character creator, I was impressed overall, but I feel like this level of customization is becoming the norm. Certainly the cosmetics will increase by ""official"" release, or in the store (more likely). Gear and items were unique, slightly varying as I level'ed up a bit. I only had about 5 gear set changes, 2 of which fully re-equipped my entire character.Gameplay - 1+R+R+R repeat 1+R+R+R repeat.... Combo systems are nice, but I feel like there could have been a lot more meat to this. I played as a Guardian, and maybe shame on me for picking probably the most generic class, but they didn't have Assassin available soooo, shame on them.... Anyways, constantly just poking stuff without any real tactical advantage or disadvantage made it dull... I did see a multitude of expansive combo lists as I leveled, but overall, most everything looked to start off with the initial 1,2,3,4 and go to R,T,Y for follow-up. Yay........ It did have me involved only to make sure I was combo'ing correctly, but I wish there was more tutorial on utilizing the skills and how to power them up. Sure, they can choose to not give massive amounts of tutorials to new characters in the beginning but at lvl 11 when you're in a small story instance with mobs constantly spawning on you and your health and damage out-put are not keeping up, they should've informed you that there were means in which you could've buffed up your attacks.Overall, it's in Early Access, that's fine. But nothing really grabbed me and said ""Your character is awesome, and their story is meaningful, here's why"". And I felt the controls were more clunky than most games. In either case, I feel like I wasted some money, and probably should read more into the ""Mixed"" review rating for this game. It should be taken into consideration when the first 10 reviews that come up for this game are all negative.Again, I'd like to mention that I had a few friends that are playing this, however, becuase they were in the intial kick-off of the game, they are already well into the 40-level range, and working on alt characters. That was because the developers somehow allowed the dps scaling to pretty much 1-shot most mobs, so characters soared through the levels. That has been fixed, however for all newer players, they will have to do the standard leveling (not so much of a grind from what I've seen) but without the majority of the server population there to be around, it's empty. You're the only one going from quest spot to quest spot, and I'd be even more concerned with having to deal with your first instance where you'd need a group. You would either A, wait around for long periods of time hoping some people of relatively the same level come and help, or B, you could get your super high level friends to roll you through it and not really get to enjoy any challenge at all...In any case, the game doesn't seem to have much appeal to me, and therefore I would not recommend it.Thank you.",0

1558,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"My first review of this game was negative, because there was issue with the loading ingame objects, which made the game unplayable. This summer that issue was finally fixed, and I must say that this game is a one of the best clickers. You will get a lot of heroes with different abilities, which can be useful with different formations and conditions of game worlds. Yes, here player not simple clicking the same five buildings or one monster slot, but run a series of quests in a different worldsets with a little story in them.Each two weeks game have an events in which you can obtain up to four new heroes (I think that there will be ""up to six"" near halloween) and gather a lot of idols.

740,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game was great! WAS. It's creative, feels good to play, and doesn't rely on money to start playing (because it's free). The characters are fresh, the maps are interesting, the abilities are decently balanced, there is almost nothing I can say that is not positive about this game. The fatal flaw is simply that this game suffers from the beta syndrome so many new exciting games suffer from. It started as a finished product, and then the developers decided to change it... over... and over... and over again. I liked this game a lot, and with every update I decided I would give it a good shot before deciding the update made the game play worse, but the truth is, every update makes the game play more dull. When you have a game with many characters, they tend to become less and less balanced over time, making it difficult for anyone to play a character that isn't in the meta. The skins are getting a little out of hand, I enjoy content in a game, but all of it is just paid cosmetics, making opening crates feel almost empty... Well, it would feel empty if it weren't for the fact that all of the ability upgrades and actually interesting mechanics in this game are tethered to micro-transactions. While you can technically own everything in the game just by playing for a long time, this would take thousands of hours, and it really does encourage you to buy things in order to enjoy them, there simply isn't enough gold and elixir for everything, at least not in an easily accessible fashion. The game is still fun, and it is definitely worth at least exploring because of the price (nothing), but it just isn't reaching its full potential. I recommend this game, but I can only rate it a 6/10, and that may be too generous.",1
19407,Dungeon Defenders II,2018.0,"After clearing the campaign (and almost 100 hours on record) I've only managed to get to Chaos VI, because scaling is just plain horrible.Positive:+ Since early access, the path to getting to adventures / campaign is way less obnoxious. When I first played this game, you would need to play through 12 different levels to get to the endgame. And, not to mention, leveling to 50. + All characters in your active Hero Deck now receive experience. (This was not a thing in the past. Great to reach end game faster.)+ Using strategy is the best way to handling the dangers you must face while defending.Neutral:/ Gear drops are very randomly based. This is a problem because you end up having to repeat the same map over and over./ Ascension XP takes ages to level. Not a negative point but causes people to lose interest over time. (currently only ascension level 106.)/ Chaos materials require you to win (for Tinkering). Very annoying especially when you lose on the last wave (happens to me quite a lot. (EDIT: This becomes easier with tomorrow's Pirate Booty update, where you can retry your last failed wave.)/ You are limited in getting Defender Medals every 3 days. This is a substitute for Gems for new heroes / Tinkering, but can run off really quickly.Negative:- To get more legendary drops or a bigger XP bonus, you must play with other players. Back in Dungeon Defenders I, I never found a problem with this. Also, not many people seem to play this in the US West region as I've thought they would, so it forces me to go solo.- Bags require you to buy gems. This is not an issue for me, but for a free to play player, it might be difficult, especially if you don't get the Regeant Bank.- Bank vault tabs and Regeant Bank also requires gems.Overall I do recommend the game but you need to remember to manage your limited inventory space.",1
10696,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFor starters, let me point out this is a FREE game and you know honestly it doesn't feel like it not in the sense that its pay to win but for the fact that I myself would've paid money for the game (hense why I bought the founder upgrade to support these devs!) Players have to escape an astonishing disaster in Ring of Elysium, a battle royale shooter developed by Tencent Games that adds on to what Playerunkowns and other battle royale games but with a twist of winter! There is three classes to chose from which change gameplay(Snowboard, Glider or Ice Picks/Rappel). They say early access is going for 3-6 months but we'll see about that. Im a new fan of these devs so Im not 100% sure what to expect, I can just hope. There is cons like the sound at certain times can be extremely annoying, driving collisions seem to be a little too flaily and no impact, and there is some desync on players. But I mean, for a FREE game that got released yesterday in early access, I'd say this is polished enough to stay alive further upon developement.So far, enjoying this game and recommend it, not like your wasting your money here!

There is free shotgun in the store which I dont think many guests know about, so get the shotgun and go clay pigeon shooting (don't worry about wasting ammo because it is unlimited in the vacinity of a range or lodge) or go pheasant hunting and if you like it, buy the membership.

It's not everyday you see the both silly brothers being killed by their lost brother and then starting a war for get the company. It's not everyday you find out a game where you have to kill a lot of hordes of robots made by the crazy lost brother....Seriously, TF2 has even story behind the mercenaries protecting briefcases, pushing giant bombs and capturing points. Also fighting not-so-smart robots. It's not only about the hats (actualy), it's the gameplay! It's not the same thing in comparison with others FPS's.Entering even more inside the game, you can discover more random stuff, like the in-game fads.

647,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewGame ReviewThe game, as directed from the title is a dungeon based defence game in which the player builds towers in order to stop enemy minions from destroying the main base. As well as the main objective on the harder maps, are side objectives which the player needs to defend otherwise it will allow for more enemies, often flying types to be able to access the map making it harder especially without certain classes.Logical thinking is required by the player to complete for ever changes and more difficult maps. As the game calls upon the player to think through the use of their 'Tower Budget' whilst building defences to stop the enemy minions form reaching the main base, the better the tower the higher the cost. Along with the budget, the player has the choice of class types, which impacts the levels massively, as depending on what characters are on the team during the missions effects the difficulty as some cannot attack air units or some are not able to take as many hits as others.Along with the thinking required is the effect of the choices made, as in the game they are able to have a very negative or positive outcome as for example having a Mage try to tank hits from enemies would be a poor choice compared to having a knight tank the hits. But there is a lot more than just deciding what person defends where, each player chooses their class each one having different abilities or attributes that can help the team and as stated above the choice of towers will be one to rule all or end all within an instant.Considering these whilst looking at the game play allows you to see that things are coming together well, the game entices the player into what is called a 'one more round' mood, in which if a player is enjoying the game by winning or by having or rethink the same map several times to pass. As well as being able to invite friends to have a more cooperative team and a more thrilling experience as everyone will be able to have a laugh no matter what the outcome. Overall my experience with Dungeon Defenders 2 was a good experience and produced a lot of good points, however with every game there are a few things that can be tweaked. Such as the enchantment system as I never truly understood it whilst using it and the glitch at the main hub (tavern) where players fall through the floor.Overall i give DD2 a 9/10 rating.",1

707,Magic Duels,2016.0,"This game is a lot more like magic is ought to be, lots of cards and all the freedom of the world in the deck builder.The only thing that's keeping me from palying this game a lot is that the grind to get all the cards is insane.I've played Ultima Online, I know how to grind. But this grind is beyond that. Off course, you can pay for the cards..but there's no 'buy all cards' button, you have to buy coins and then boosters and that's quite a hassle (buying a booster after grinding 10 matches against AI takes like a full minute..why??)- it never even tells me how many boosters I'll need.

The game is more concerned about over priced micros, instead of fixing the desync, RNG, adding skills in the game, and fixing builds you can't even play until you're way late into the game or nerfing a build into the ground. I don't see how you can level a character over and over again with desync in hardcore, with out offering some kind of power leveling. The cheaper the Micros, the more money you'd get.

13958,Creativerse,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewNOTE: I have many hours outside of Steam, as well.Although it looks like a Minecraft rip-off on the surface, once you start playing, you'll realize that it is its own game. Not all sandbox games with squares are trying to be Minecraft.. especially this one.The Graphics: 7.5/10Yes, the graphics are really nice to look at, along with the animations. The world comes alive much more than many other games, including Minecraft. However, with all that's going on - nearly everything is animated - it can get a bit laggy. Just because your PC can run games like Grand Theft Auto V at 60 fps on high graphics, does NOT mean you can run this game on high graphics - I know this firsthand. I have all my settings set to minimal. I can barely tell the difference between max and minimum graphics visually, but it does effect my FPS. Overall, really nice graphics and animations, but it needs to be optimized for minimal lag. The UI & Controls: 9/10The user interface is fantastic all around. It isn't the same bare-bones UI you'd expect in early access game (I see you over there, ARK), but is instead detailed and elegant. It could use some improvements, sure, but for early access, the UI is really nice and self-explanatory. The controls are somewhat familiar - if you've played Minecraft, there won't be a huge learning curve. WASD and mouse buttons are the same as in Minecraft. It has more controls, actually - and it still doesn't seem overwhelming even on your first time playing. The Gameplay: 8.5/10Like most sandbox games, when you load up a world, it doesn't tell you what exactly you need to do. You start off exploring, playing with the controls, and seeing what there is to offer. Eventually, as you explore, you'll find a crafting table. Once you find that, it becomes self explanatory - find this, craft this, build this, do this.. it isn't confusing. However, don't mistake this for the game being linear. It is not linear at all - you can take your survival in many directions. Unlike many sandbox survival games, you have a single do-it-all tool that comes attatched to your character, and you simply have to upgrade it to break new types of blocks. This makes the game less confusing, but may even make it too simplistic. However, overall, the game is quite self-explanatory, but in a fun way. You won't run out of things any time soon. And if you do...The Multiplayer: Your worlds are servers. When you create a world, it becomes public on the list of worlds - people can search for the name of your world, and (try to) join it. You can password protect the world, or make it so those who join can't edit the world, but anyone can view your world by searching the name of the world. This makes multiplayer with friends extremely easy. You simply tell them the name of the world (and password, if you set one), they search it, and they can easily join. It's fantastic. There's also a wide range of administrative tools for your world, and settings to make your experience easier or more difficult.The Community: 10/10Fantastic community. The devs replied to my problems within hours, and the community was equally ready and happy to help. This is not an immature community.The problems:There is no chat in the game, even if multiple people are online in the same world. It requires a fairly updated graphics card - there's a good chance you'll need to do some updating of your drivers.It can lag, even on great PCs... needs some optimizing.I'm a little worried about it becoming free-to-play at launch. I fear the microtransactions...Overall: 8.5/1010/10 would kill leaf creatures with a twig again.",1

I don't see how that is a problem at all considering the costs for maintaining hundreds of worlds from just one player is ridiculous. Creativerse Pro gets the developers more money to make more awesome updates for the game.In my opinion, this game is awesome. You can make cornerstones to make a blueprint out of so you can get a house up without thinking of a really neat design for a house. Night mobs are quite difficult to start with but aren't so difficult as you progress through the game which I find to be a +.

11007,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"This game started out really promising, but took a pretty awful turn in the past 9 months or so. The people designing the cards just seem to have so much trouble keeping them balanced.For reference to how bad the problem of unbalanced overpowered cards became, the devs announced that they were going to do monthly balance changes not too long ago. I know a lot of people agree with the idea, but a full release card game that people put real money into, where you release an expansion every THREE months needs balance changes every SINGLE month? You need to keep changing things even after a single nerf wave following an expansion? It's a bit of a testament to how bad their balance philosophy is; they change powerful cards just make other cards even more unbalanced. It's completely out if hand and a little overwhelming, to be honest. They also do these really strange and out of place crossovers, like with street fighter. Kind of just wish they could have kept the integrity of the standalone universe. But that's a personal preference. I don't know why you'd bother playing this game instead of the other more polished options.

9962,Path of Exile,2015.0,"One of the greatest concepts ever. The highly customizable builds makes this game sometimes a bit too much enjoyable actually, beside the fact the desync is a thing since release. Desync is really a thing you need to admit to at this game and if you can't you'll end up ragequitting anyways. Had the most fun I've ever had in a game with a build (Facebreaker Cyclone) which actually 'caused desync quite a bit and it didn't irritated me at all to be honest. The gem system is really worked out well and the replay value of endgame is amazingly high. Don't expect to see other mobs or other maps a lot, but expect to see dangerous and deadly combinations of these two a lot if you wan't to risk it! You need to make this game enjoyable yourself by asking help of others as well, the game is kind of hard to get into but once you're in it's hard to get out. This game is one of the definitions of addiction and dedication but it's totally worth it. I would highly recommend to start the game in a heroic league, the best way to learn is failing in this game!",1
2476,Paladins®,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you're looking to install this game, stop.Since Hi-rez has been preparing to squeeze money out of player for months.For example, in the recent patch, Hi-rez introduced the VIP system which is just another premium currency to buy cosmetics items (which now Paladins has over 4 currencies if I'm not mistaken)Another example would be the rent-premium items which give extra exp.You might say every game has this premium cosmetics, but no the point is not about that. The point is if a game, any game, keeps introducing new premium mechanics (not to be confused with premium cosmetics), not for long they will run out of space for 'premium mechanics', therefore, they would have to rewrite the whole mechanics for more money (which Hi-rez did).And from the fact that Hi-rez prioritises on making money out of premium mechanics, we can see that we won't be able to play the game we'd installed 3 or 6 or 9 months ago. Of course, you could say it's in BETA, it has to be developing, but no, it would not work like that since Hi-rez will be pushing updates that do not concern with the development of the game but rather just for the sake of 'developing' and money. And there is an example of this; the OB64 which majority of the player disagreed with update (roughly 74.28% of the player) but Hi-rez was still pushing out the update, because it's on Christmas period so if Hi-rez didn't push this update they would gain little to no money.tldr; I'll just leave it like this, there are lots of things to be explained. But if you like the game just try not to invest on it that much because Hi-rez would just force another new mechanics anyways, which may or may not look like a premium one, but it is a premium one because no one wouldn't be updating something that doesn't make them money.",0

The combat system is very easy and fun to work with, the game also has a wide range of PvP challenges and PvE challenges, with the load of achievements and so-called perks you can unlock it will keep you busy for a long time. There are also huge missions that take a few hours to complete called ""Adventure-packs"" they are free and you can play them up to 4 times each day, these missions have their own storyline and really give an amazing experience and alot of fun, I wouldn't recommend doing them alone tho. Get some friends to do them togheter!

2918,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewAS OF BUILD ""ROMMEL"", GAME IS CURRENTLY ON BUILD ""UTZ"":There should be a limit to how broken a game can be and still be called a ""Beta"".This game is late Alpha at best.I should mention that I've been playing this game since early early. Just recently did I move to the Steam version.""Great servers in great locations all over the world"" is the biggest frikkin joke of the 21st century. At an average ping of 63ms, you will be subject to lag like you were playing with 500ms ping. I wish I was exaggerating, but the delay really does range anywhere from a quarter of a second to a second and a half, two seconds. The more likely answer is that the servers are being operated out of tin cans in Somalia.The game tries to make a selling point of massive battlefields with tons of players, when really you're lucky if you get 20v20. I mean come on. That's just barely better than the typical 16v16 on a console. This isnt a console game.The economy is HORRIBLY steep.Repair and rearm costs will put you out in the streets, and a bolt action rifle from WWI costs you as much as a medium tank.The hitboxes are buggy and suffer from horrible hit detection, much like Battlefield 4 does, however, this game doesnt have nearly the amount of calculations per second to handle that BF4 does. Even when the game detects that you hit someone, it doesnt always detect that you did damage. I've had instances of five confirmed torso hits on a player before with the M1 Garand until he died; a weapon that generally takes two or three hits in this game.The developers don't claim that this game is supposed to be a simulator, in fact they blatantly say it isnt. But some of the crap they put in the game is so unrealistic it borderlines on straight up make-believe. Scopes and sights affecting stopping power? It's as if they've never even handled a weapon in real life. Airborne can only carry one weapon. Can't even carry hand grenades or AT grenades with your primary. What happened, Reto? Did a five year old tell you how soldiers were outfitted in WWII?All in all, it's a decent game with some good ideas, but it is much further behind development schedule than they would claim. A lot of the game still needs balancing and fine tuning before it should be called a beta. Until the actual state of the game catches up to the developers declaration of it, I will not recommend this game.",0

Rush into the enemy head-on jump out of your vehicles and start blasting working your way to the point. Or slowly work your way up through the tree-line looking for a tank and waiting for him to poke his head out.

Tank crew, Recon, Fighter pilots, Para-trooper and of course the most important branch infantry. Level them up to generals and they can command their own squads and you can directly affect the war!

9534,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,"Team Fortress 2, where do I even begin...The trading?The gameplay?THE HATS?THE CLASSES----------------------------------------------------There's the Scout, the Soldier, the Pyro, the Demoman, the Heavy, the Engineer, the Medic, the Sniper, and the Spy. They all have a variety of ways to either kill you easily, nearly kill you, or just annoy you to death.The Scout is the fastest class, with his Scatterguns, Pistols, and his Bats, and he is also able to double-jump in the air.The Soldier wields a Rocket Launcher, a Shotgun, and a Shovel, and is the second-slowest class.The Pyro wields a Flamethrower, a Shotgun, and a Fire Axe, and is a mysterious person, whose gender is still unknown.The Demoman wields a Grenade Launcher, Stickybomb Launcher, and a Bottle, and is a man whose liver should have shriveled up and died years ago from his drinking.The Heavy wields a Minigun, a Shotgun, and since he is oh so manly, his bare Fists, and he is also the slowest class.The Engineer has a Shotgun, a Pistol, and a Wrench. He is able to build Sentry Guns, Dispensers, and Teleporters, to help attack the enemy team and support his team.The Medic wields a Syringe Gun, a Medigun, and a Bonesaw. He's a medical ""expert"", and his Mediguns can heal the team and Ubercharge them, which can make them invulnerable for a short period of time.The Sniper wields a Sniper Rifle (no surprise there), an SMG (submachine gun), and a Kukri (a big knife thingy). He's Australian, he's got his sights on you, and you're his next target.Finally, we have The Spy. French. Elegant. Sneaky. A lady-killer metaphorically and a literal man-killer. He has his Revolver, his Knife, and his Sapper, which he can use to destroy the Engineer's buildings. His Knife can kill any enemy in the game with a Backstab (do I need to explain what a BACK-STAB is?), unless they are Ubercharged or if a Sniper is wearing the Razorback, which blocks backstabs.**NOTE: These are just stock weapons! There are tons of different weapons for you to try out! Mix and match, baby!**THE GAMEPLAY----------------------------------------------------Team Fortress 2 is often times a very fun, competitive game where you can snipe, stab, shoot, or stun, through different weapons and different classes (talked about above). There are often ""two groups"" of TF2, the P2Ps (Pay to Plays) and F2Ps (Free to Plays). P2Ps are often known for having many cosmetics, valuable weapons, and skill, while F2Ps are often dismissed as terrible players who understand nothing and just happen to chase you around the map thinking you're a Spy. (My personal experience is that most F2Ps I meet are actually quite good players.) With many maps, many gamemodes, and many players, you're bound to have a good time. Why not try some cp_powerhouse, or maybe ctf_doublecross? Perhaps pl_bananabay?-What is Competitive Matchmaking?-Competitive Matchmaking means that you're put in a server with other players as good as you, like in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. This was much requested by the community as many players end up being the only good player in a server filled with terrible players, or players much much better than you. Prayers were answered in the Gun Mettle update with the introduction of matchmaking!UPDATES----------------------------------------------------Team Fortress 2 is sadly being slowly updated, but these new updates often come in with the big guns. Some of the more recent updates as of January 1st, 2018 are the Smissmas 2017 Update and Jungle Inferno Update. There are also other major game updates from the past, especially the Uber Update, Love and War update and the Mann vs. Machine update. Many of these updates often have a Source Filmmaker (SFM) video to introduce these updates and their features, such as the Meet the Medic video for the Uber Update, the Expiration Date video for the Love and War update, and the leaked Invasion video for the Invasion Update. Some updates instead get a comic, such as the Gun Mettle update. Some of these events only last for a period of time and aren't permanent.-What do these updates introduce?-Some of these updates, in particular ones like the Love & War and Uber updates, introduce bulk amounts of new items like cosmetics, weapons, and other items like paint for your hats and unusual effects to look good in! Up until the Jungle Inferno Update, no new weapons had been added since the Tough Break updated in *2015*!Thanks for reading my review :3",1

You simply go to one battle on the map and engage enemies that may be seasoned vets, newbies , or anything inbetween. This discourages new players because they constantly get killed from every angle by people who have upwards of a thousand hours on the gameThe game is poorly optimized and requires you to fiddle with the settings to achieve a good framerate. Even then, massive battles with 90+ players will still partially lag any hardware.The server population can be pretty low off of peak hours so you might not be able to find a good fight.The ingame currency (certs) that you start out with on a new character are good at getting some upgrades or a weapon for one class/vehicle, but progression after that is fairly time-consuming if you don't play constantly or buy boosts with real money. Getting new weapons/upgrades can be a hassle for players who are very busy.The game has its flaws, but it's still completely free. If you're considering downloading Planetside, just do it and find out if you'll like it yourself.",1
5260,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,"the sakura games are pretty nice VNs but this one is just a clicker copy and a bad one.i had to actually play it for 5 minutes to review it , i just want to warn people its a waste time. and it kinda sucks many weebs will rate any anime game with♥♥♥♥♥♥a 10/10. back then on steam an anime game was a rarity, so any anime game was like a gem to be able to play it on steam and get backgrounds for it. there wasnt much out there,but i think we reached that point where theres enough already.in short the game is very boring,i played it for 2 minutes and couldnt review it,so i left it idle for another 3 minutes just to give it a bad score.",0
13405,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access Reviewokay, i Haven't made it through the last 200 rooms yet, but i can alrEady say, this game is easiLy the most terrifying game i've ever Played or seen, it has had so many moments that have tempted me to shut the game off (iM talking to you, deer god) and just wow this gamE was so well made. anyone who enjoys the horror genre should definetly have go with this one.P.S can anyone find my secret message?",1

Now i dont even have it installed :/ And when that came out it wasnt even close to being on here, And the american camo lol give me a break only camo was the frog camo. Almost had the mp44 then it went to pay to own, No more no thanks iam done. It was fun when i t was first released outside of steam now...... No.",0
641,Black Squad,2018.0,Early Access ReviewVery cool game! If you are playing games like csgo you will get adicted just like me! I can't stop playing it i recomend it toall people who likes shootikg games.,1
2515,H1Z1,2018.0,"No wonder this game is now dead, i had this game before it was split into two seprate games and back then the game was good it was the best version of H1z1 the OG BR everyone loved, and as it seems they have just killed this game so it deserves to die tbh, they have ruined the ""recoil"" of all guns to the point you have to aim so far in the air just to land a hit its stupid. i don't know how a company can be a leading BR and then kill it in a couple years. if you are deciding to try it out, don't bother it would be a waste of time just stick to Pubg or fortnite and wait for the BR genre to die. if daybreak is reverting to old map, they might aswell bring back the old mechanics so this game can be fun again.",0
7698,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2014.0,"you need to grind in it to unlock more guns to♥♥♥♥♥♥around withits not fun in the first place, so having the system by grindy makes it even less fun.the camera controls interfere with things, and when doing a full disassembly compared to a field  strip if you miss a single tiny component for taking it appart such as the front sights adjustable screw, it refuses to let you move on.I've also noticed that you can't do very simple things that you should be able to do, like putting the cleaning kit into the ak's stock before attaching it to the gunFor what purpose.",0
9033,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2016.0,"Intentionally grindy, you need to play the most unfun games to unlock anything. The interfece is pretty bad for the disassembly portion of the game, meaning the whole point of the game is not good. The shooting range of the game handles incredibly poorly, meaning there is nothing really worth playing this game for.You can honestly find better games on flash sites.",0
8141,Magic Duels,2017.0,"A great way to quickly, easily, and cheaply play the best TCG, in my opinion.EDIT: I can no longer support this game. WOTC abruptly announced that they would be cancelling any further support for this game, including patches and the new expansion coming out, and all expansions after that. This came with no warning, and many players, myself included, are quite upset. I for one dropped at least $100 on packs to support what had been the best way FOR ME to play Magic, and would say that until this point, I had gotten my moneys worth. I would have gladyl kept doing so to. The game had improved consistently with erach new release. I should have seen this coming, given WOTC's track record with online and digital platforms in the past. WOTC needs to stop treating their digital product and their digital customers like trash and get with the times. Anyone who follows Magic IRL knows that the property is in some hot water right now (bannings anyone?), but this is just as bad for their product and certainly doesn't breed consumer confidence. They didn't announce any kind of replacement product, they didn't announce that there would be some way to transfer money spent in this to some kind of redemption feature of Magic Online or RL Magic, or even the supposed Magic Digital Next that nobody knows anything about yet. If they do anything to Magic Digital Next like what they just did to Duels, which had been my go-to source for fun, cheap, and convinient Magic, then MDN is doomed to fail as well. TL;DR: WOTC pulling some Ubisoft/EA type of♥♥♥♥♥♥on their fans. DO NOT SUPPORT IT.",0
3256,Infestation: The New Z,2016.0,was in a battle royal match in the top 10 left change weapon game crashes 10/10 - IGN but srsly this game is buggy and laggy as ♥♥♥♥ right now I dont recommend playing this game right now but maybe when they fixed some crash problems,0
2958,Neverwinter,2015.0,"One of the best MMO's on steam! I have a lot of fun playing this game put at least $20 into this game, if you were to ask me what MMO should I get, I would recomend this one not only does it have a descent story line (I don't listen to the story.) It also has great voice acting something a lot of MMO's lack.(Meaning the peson doing the voice is good at it. That doesn't mean it sounds good.)(COUGH* COUGH* DC UNIVERSE)(COUGH* COUGH* TERRIBLE VOICE ACTING)This game has a better overall story than DC Universe.HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
8873,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewBig ships, bigs guns, big explosions, and lot of tactics.All the ships are very different, with very different roles, and teamwork is the key to victory, more than in any other moba's I've been playing. There are no ""builds"" or ""op stuff"" for you, everyone plays at about the same level. Individual skill isn't vital, even if it helps. Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork, nothing else. And with this friendly community, that's really fun.Pros:- Rookie friendly, with a simple tutorial, good matchmaking and progressive learning curve- Ships are very different from each others, from the light fighter to the super-heavy capital spaceship- Way more players since last ""free week-end"", from 150 max a day to 3000 average- Not pay to win. Except cosmetic or early access starter pack, you absolutely don't need to pay to rule the galaxy.- Not another ""three-lanes-minions-towers"" moba, the arena is nothing else than an asteroid field.- Ships are really niceCons:- High pings can occure, that can slow the game and can make it difficult to play. I think it's because there are a lot of people playing it now.- With the last update, the tech-tree is now larger, and it's harder to get the ship you really want to have. - In game movement and camera are hard to master, shooting an ennemy behind while fleeing will makes almost everytime you hitting an asteroid, and being struck in it. Maybe a ""watch behind"" key would help a bit. - We want even more ships. I hope these will come for free, and not as DLC. Great game overall, do not hesitate to get it!!",1

2169,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"This is the closest digital replacement to MTG you'll find - including the mana system that can sometimes frustrate those who don't understand why it's there. It's very good and quite friendly for newbies and people like me who don't want to spend money. Daily quests and free modes like the gauntlet give you enough gold/dust to build your collection quickly. I'm completely F2P and after a few months am at the point where I can build top tier decks, or easily grind the needed dust for them in a few days. My only gripe is that I'm still so bad at draft lolUpdate: I finally managed to hit draft master!",1
542,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFINALLY, i love atrix entertainment games, always have supported them, im excited for AQ3D, but it IS a grindy game so have something to do on the side while playing, but it has alot of comical plots and jokes, nicely done and child friendly",1

A great game, great fun missions.few problems::The zen is so expensivethere isnt many starting customisation items so alot of people wear the same stuff.lifetime sub is expensivegood things::The game itself plays really well, visually looks great. easy controls.Good storyline and fun little adventure packs and events.so i recommend you pick this game up.PS:for some reason my thing glitches out and says i have only played 10mins when i have played over 10 hours, also my achievements dont show up",1
1489,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI like shooters, but I'm not sold on this one yet.Amazingly frustrating game so far.  I think the concept is pretty good, but it is unbelievably unforgiving.  Kinda takes the fun out of it to spawn 20 times and die without a single kill.  Most of the time by people you never see.I guess that makes it realistic, but fun?  Meh not so much.Will keep trying to see if it improves for me but not holding out much hope.May 2016 update:RETO launched a new update yesterday.  To let players know how that went, I'll just say the following.  Their server was down for almost 24 hours immediately after launch.  When players actually got the chance to play....I found out that if you play tanks now and your tank dies you can have 5+ minute spawn times.  This wouldn't be bad if it wasn't so ridiculously easy for infantry to kill tanks...but it is.  And of course, friendly infantry rarely keeps an eye on tanks.  Why should they?  They gain nothing from helping tankers.  Do yourself a favor....pass on this game.",0
7139,War Thunder,2017.0,"Had a blast in this game over the couple years I've played, i know the hours dont seem to show it either. Game can be a bit grindy at times but if you grab a buddy for the ride can be good fun.",1
15542,Shop Heroes,2018.0,"shop heros is a relaxing game. its a game i open up whenever im bored and just dont know what to do. its great with a dual screen so u can watch a movie or something like that onthe other screen since the game does not require you attention all the time.while the game do have the dreaded ""pay to win"" in it, it is not really that important since u dont rly play versus anyone else unless you do hardcore arena. much of the pay to win is simply cosmetics and doin stuff a wee bit faster",1
10368,Star Trek Online,2015.0,"I'll recommend the game as a mildly amusing way to burn an afternoon, seeing as how it was free.  Mildly amusing, that is, if you play Klingon.  You get the option to run about smacking Vulcans and Bolians with a bat'telh and then blow away some much heavier Federation ships in need of an attitude adjustment.  Even on Klingon side, after I smoked a Chimera dreadnaught (one of the biggest boats out there) in a B'rel Bird of Prey (the starter ship) I felt very much like I'd seen everything there was to see here.Playing Federation, on the other hand, was just insultingly silly.  Going from the academy to the captain's chair in the space of an afternoon, in the company of your bubbleheaded teenybopper classmates who all seem to think they're going to be captains too sometime soon, just wrecks all suspension of disbelief.  As does taking an old clunker of a training ship out, running into a Borg cube, and NOT getting owned in five seconds.  Sorry, I don't see how I'm supposed to take that seriously as either a Trek fan or a newcomer just looking to blow stuff up in space.A few very notable nice touches, though the memorial to the Star Trek actors and crew who have passed away was both touching and depressing (the list of names is really, really long...).  It was fun for a bit, and can't say I won't go hunting Feds again in the future, but don't wait up for me.",1
6029,DCS World Steam Edition,2014.0,This is the gold standard for flight simulation. All of the aircraft are excellently modeled. Learning how to operate each is a challenging and incredibly rewarding process. Unfortunately there isn't much single-player content here due to lousy AI. If all you care about is the actual flight procedures and/or playing multiplayer these are excellent sims.,1
12340,WARMODE,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is like fast food.It's bad for you, but it's addictive... the negatives are:>UI is a bit sh*t>Ton of hackers>Soundtrack can get really annoying>Not a lot of mapsNeutral (Not bd, nor good)>Mechanics are meh.>Weapons aren't great>Leveling doesn't make that much sensePositive:>Doesn't take up much memory>Graphics are better than expected",1
12805,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2013.0,"At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses.The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer.The game is simply tactful; itâ€™s brilliant when youâ€™re alive and even when youâ€™re dead the game is still fun to watch other players.Global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have createdYou will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself.This game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself.",1
10597,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"Planetside 2 is an excellent game for those who have too much time on their hands. It takes a long time to level up, but when you progress, you feel like you have acomplished something because you don't die as much.",1
16911,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,"This is obviously just Bloons TD Battles ported from a browser game, so don't be expecting anything different. Nevertheless this is still amazing game, I used to play this a lot on browser, and I am glad they did turn it into a steam game, as I use steam a lot more than anything now.I love the fact that you have to actually play to earn your stuff in this game, because as the more matches you play, the more upgrades you can get for your monkeys which makes it more skill based, a lot of the time you have to make last minute decisions to make sure you can defend against both game and enemy bloons, which makes it very fun, I love that there are many different strategies and combinations of monkeys, that each person can have a different way to play.One of the only problems that I have with this game is that there is a surplus of cheaters, I was going for the achievement where you have to win 20 games in a row, I had gotten to 13 when I was met with someone who didn't take any damage, they let about 2-3 rounds worth of balloons though, and this really annoys me, I wish the developers would really try to work on this, as it makes me not want to play and in my opinion, is the biggest problem with BTD Battles.Either way, it is a great game, I love to play it when I have free time, so I do recommend this.",1
6077,PlanetSide 2,2018.0,"Great concept, great game and great gameplay.One concern which is evident as many players probably know already is that the game's playerbase is rapidly declining as off now.

3011,Dota 2,2014.0,"Don't bother spending hundreds on other language learning programs, or ones that claim to be the best, like Rosetta Stone. DotA 2 has the market cornered and you would have to be a fool to pay anything for these ""superior"" pieces of software when DotA 2 is completely free of charge! When you want to learn a new language, simply queue for your region, and select the language that you already know. Valve's patented system will immediately match you with other language speakers who will get you on the fast track to success! You will love your learning experience. I can guarantee that you will not grow to hate other cultures due to a language barrier, because soon you will be able to speak Portugeuse, Spanish, Russian, and Chinese!",1
2028,Black Squad,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewOk so, i need to say this game is just so good for a free to play. Most free to plays they make you have to buy things to win and in this game everything is unlockable and purchasable. You can but the best weapons with cash or earn them easily in 5 rounds. The only thing that cost real cash are crates and crates contain different skins for knives and guns. Skins dont make you better. So this game isent pay to win at all. Theres some competitive in it although this game isent based on realisim. The physics are nice and smooth and the game is very fast paced. Graphics are very well done and the effects are nice as well. 10 minites in and you will be hooked and playing all night.",1

2026,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,"Where does one start here? Like really.I have 69 hours or so on this game. However, I bought it about a month before the Soviets were added.That was when the game declined. It will probably never meet the greatness that this game was before the Soviets were added. I remember picking this game up and saying, ""Hey, this looks sweet."" And it was! Germany and America dueling it out. Skirmishes was the best and both teams seemed to take turns winning wars. Simply because they both had good, experienced Generals/Officers.So what happened? Well the Soviet Union came in. And because the CoD generation of gamers exists, they went to the Soviets because of their stronkness. And so that team got flooded and everyone whined that they weren't good enough.Right off the bat, they had buffed spawn tickets and it seemed like they had good equipment. They needed this because it saved their lives. Then it took a dark turn. They lose every war in last place but win most of the skirmishes because of some stupid HP system and some really stupid OP weapons.Another major issue: TanksFirst off, I'd like to say that when you have a machine gun in the game cost just as much as a Tiger I, you've got issues. ""So, what is the MAIN issue?"" I hear you saying aloud as you read this. Well, the tanks are their own worst enemy. If you do what their supposed to do, support Infantry as they move from objective to objective, they get wrecked by an Anti-Tank Rambo with a motorcycle and some AT Grenades. So the tanks sit back and cut people in half with 75mm's, 85mm's, and 88mm's from a mile away. So, the infantry and paratroopers are caught with their pants around their ankles with their♥♥♥♥♥ which is mooning a taxi driver in NYC by the way, hanging in the breeze. So objectives just get traded until someone, eight hours later, wins.Tanks also get killed for staying still so it's a lose/lose situation if you pick that career option.Oh and it doesn't make a difference if you are driving in a Tiger II or an M4 Sherman, your♥♥♥♥♥is molasses as Sheriff Buford T. Justice would say.Planes are an absolute joke to fly. I can't seem to do it and others can. Fly Germany if you want wings on your chest I guess? I don't know. The P-38 seems like a stupid option for an aircraft. The P-51 and P-47 were more used than the P-38 for the game's intended purpose so why is this mediocre aircraft there?Paratrooper is the best career hands down. You can join the fight anywhere your plane flies and you get that sweet sweet M1A1 Carbine. Sniper's are OP but I guess that's their role so I don't know. OHK rifles, that ones the snipers get, are realistic but they seem limited to the bolt-action rifles. Most of which fire the same round as their ""starter rifle"" counter parts for brand new players. And these starter rifles take two or three shots to kill someone at medium to close range. So not realistic then.Infantry is where you'll get the most out of the game. The most weapons and vehicles for all purposes. Before AT mines were nerfed I would destroy two Tiger's in every life I had. Just place the mine below it's♥♥♥♥♥ run away, shoot the mine. And the whole thing just blew up. The most fun I had.The Soviets get no MG on their starter utility car/vehicle. So they are at a supreme disadvantage going against level 1 American or German motorized infantry.Currently, this game is turning to garbage update after update. People don't cooperate with teams at all. They just go out to score some Kills because....K/D's are more important.The playerbase is shrinking and no new players are coming because all of the good reviews are in the negative. Some good effort was poured into this game but ultimately, the developers didn't listen to the community. I think they should try again, but smooth things out before adding content.So, I give a negative review for Bicycle Simulator 2016.",0
2566,Path of Exile,2015.0,"Don't let the Steam hours decieve you, I have played over 4k+ hours of this game.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I started playing PoE on the 9th of February, 2012. At that time, the game was in Closed Beta, It was hard to get a key to get in. I've been playing the game on and off ever since.First I'd like to start with some Pros and Cons.+ Unlimited replayability.+ Insanely fun.+ Difficult to master.+ Very good economy system.+ It pays off to play with friends.+ Well made microtransaction-system.- Desync.- Starts off slow if youre a beginner.The game is very big. It consists of 3 acts, featuring 3 difficulties plus an End-game ""Map"" system, with a level cap of 100. It even comes with races and ""recently"" they've included special leagues with special formats and gimmicks that the normal ""Standard"" and ""Hardcore"" versions don't have. The game features one of (if not) the biggest passive-tree in all of video-gaming. It is a very big thing, it's what makes Path of Exile what it is. All of the different combinations of skills and passives you can do is endless, you will never do every single combination. Skills aren't granted through the tree, Skills are given to you using different gems, which are given to you through completing the games story-line and finding them by killing things.The economy system of PoE is very interesting, it consists of ""orbs"" that you will find while killing things, these orbs are the currency. For a list of all the currency click here.[www.pathofexile.com] Using these orbs you can trade for different items with other players aswell as with NPCs inside of the towns or your own Hideout.""Well, how does GGG make money of this game?""GGG makes money by their fantastic Microtransaction model. It is -all- cosmetics with some convinence items (stash expansions, these are a great way of supporting the game if you dislike the cosmetics).The game is hard, it's not easy to play and it's definetly not easy to adapt to the desyncs and such. You WILL ♥♥♥♥ your first character up. I recommend visiting the PoE Forums at first and finding a build labeled ""cheap"" and then following that for your first character. Playing with friends definetly pays off as it makes the grinding a bit less tedious and it generally makes the leveling phase alot more enjoyable. The game even gives you a +50% Increased Drops per person in your party.Overall, the game is alot of fun with very few flaws, biggest one being the desync, but if you enjoy playing ARPGs, or if you disliked D3, this game is definetly worth trying out. And if you never have played before, don't play on Standard, it's practicly the dumpster of all leagues. ",1
15739,DCS World Steam Edition,2018.0,"Dcs world Is a fun yet sometimes frustrating experience. I will state that I love DCS world and get behind the stick of the a10 and f 15 whenever I can. This game is not ACE combat it is a tough as nails simulator that you learn as much as you play My(at the time of writing this) 75 hours of play only half of that has been spent flying the other half has been spent paused reading manuals watching youtube videos all in an attempt to learn the ins and outs os this sim. Though these to me are no strikes against the game I have spent 100s of hours in FSX and Xplane 11 so flying the models in this sim comes easy to me....the flying comes easy utilizing an aircraft as a weapon takes real skill and dedication to learning if this does not sound appealing at all this game is not for you.But now the Bad. For as much as I love this sim... It needs some real work. The UI is so clunky it will make your teeth hurt,many of the tutorials are simply inacurate due to say the controls being updated on the key board but the tutorial remaining in its orginal layout. many of the pre made missions and campanges are buggy if not completely broken(there are individual patchs for each campange). mission briefings have not been changed to reflect map updates so you must go into mission planner to get an accurate lay out of the mission. Even still mission objectives are very vaugue and you will likely get shot down just trying to find your target. I remapped all key board controls because to me any way the defaults make no logical sense and button combos are so spread out on the key board that you often times have to take both hands of the flight stick and throttle to find them. This game is not well optimixed my pc in no potato and will choke even on high settings. which is a shame as maxed out this game is simply sexy as all hell.that being said I still recommend rough edges and all. RecommendationsRebind all the Keys, hitting one key in the middle of an intense dog fight to change modes on your radar is better than using both hands. Get flamming cliffs 3, The su 25t is a great and Free plane and I recommend trying it first. But the air craft in Fc3 to me have more stable flight characteristics and are easier to lean from.The a10a Brrrrrrrt nuff said.A flight stick and throttle with rudder controls are a must.optinal voice attack(on steam) and a track IR set up will make this game far more enjoyable.Edit: I found a solution to my preformance problems. Hitting alt enter after the game starts apparently the game even if you set it to run in full screen runs in borderless window mode which just craps all over your frame rates with this game. This simple trick allows me to Max this game(almost) with a pretty stable 80 fps.",1

6878,Elsword,2014.0,"This game seems like a poor platformer compared to other games like smash brothers to metroid, to even Dust.  It has a dedicated comunity, and content still being added on.  And it costs money.  I've made it far without paying a dime, but there is clear and anoying ploys to get you to spend cash.  however, it's dungeons are interesting but too linear.  This isn't a game about exploring.  And in PvP, there is a high skill climb if you aren't use to the genre or fail to understand how to get out of a stunlock, but there are plenty of guilds out there who would be willing to help you learn how to survive the pvp.",1
18533,H1Z1,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIts a pretty good game. If you have the extra $10 i would buy PlayerUnknowns BattleGrounds. Its just a better, more professional version of this game. This game has 3 main guns. AR, AK, and a shotgun. PUBG has WAY more guns, PUBG also has acogs, red dots, silencers stocks. More rifles, Better Visuals, And one VERY IMPORTANT thing that this game does not have. ANTIALIASING. Games like this REQUIRE antialiasing. You just cant see far distances at 1080p. You probably woulnt need AA if you have say a 1440p or 4k monitor. But for 1080p, you can barely tell if its a person or a freaking tree stump. H1Z1 is also really buggy, you can get stuck in corners forever, and you die by gas. TBH I probably wouldn't have even bought this game if my other friends didn't have it. I would have strait up bought PUBG. Like I said earlier, its a higher quality version of this game. With more Gameplay. Mainly cause in H1Z1 you end up using the same exact same gun every game.",1

13925,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game went from being an okay early developmental game that was fun and had a nice twist on the traditional battle royale. But, on September 8th, I went to launch this game and it was completely ♥♥♥♥ed over and all the progress they had moved towards had been completely lost THEY KILLED THEIR OWN GAME IT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SUCKS AND NO ONE SHOULD PLAY IT, NO CLASSES, NO WEAPONS, NO NOTHING FOR REALM ROYALE MIGHT AS WELL PLAY ROBLOX",0
14015,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFrom someone who pushed Masters in the first week of the game releasing, this game was incredibly unique, amazing and different to every Battle Royale game that I had played. The crafting system was perfect that forced people to fight at the start and win battles in order to reap the rewards of a legendary weapon, the risk of dropping in a populated area had a pay off because if you won, you came out on top with legendary weapon and gear to craft. Now? My team mate drops, and instantly a guy gets his legendary weapon in the first chest and deletes everyone nearby. RNG to this extent in a Battle Royale game should never be allowed, and it has completely broken the game. Once this change is looked at, or reverted, I will happily play the game again. You should never encourage people to avoid fights and loot in a fast paced Battle Royale game, and there should never be RNG aspects to that extent of someone winning a fight. Cannot recommend in its current state. Developers are all over the place and change the game on an almost daily basis. ASK YOUR COMMUNITY FIRST about changes, after all, we are the players that play your game.",0

2280,Business Tour - Board Game with Online Multiplayer,2017.0,"Aside from the baphomet symbol and sun symbol on the ""dice"" ads, the game is pretty much pay2win, where you fork over money to buy dice that give you greater chances to roll those winning numbers, in which case multiplayer session will be brutal, even those sessions where you choose ""no gadgets"" doesn't mean they won't be using the special dice, plenty of times I was so close to winning, only to be devasated at the last few moments of gameplay.

I personally had a lot of trouble with the Sniper ships, as of right now.-Very few players.-You have to grind to unlock new abilities and ships, unless you buy in-game currency.",1

2445,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is really fun. It brings a new twist to tower defense games. It is in early stages yet so be ready for some bumps along the way.

11509,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access Reviewconnection issues aside, this is a very generic MMO. If you have previously played Blade and Soul, Black Desert Online, Aion or Revelation Online.. you've already played a much better game than Bless. Go show your support there. This game has a long ways to go before it catches up to any of those, and its already been out for years. ",0
5706,Trove,2015.0,"This game is great. Put off playing for a long time because of the Minecraft like graphics, and people putting it down for being a ""kid game"". It's fast paced and easy to pick up. You do get tons of loot easily, but there is also tons of rare loot that almost no one has. There are boxes that drop after level 10(Chaos Box) that have a rare chance to give you cash shop items. So it's possible to get pretty much any cash shop item just by playing the game.I've seen no Pay to Win features all, this game probably has one of the best microtransaction systems I've seen, also many of the cash shop items are purchasable using a currency earned in game(Cubits).Once you get around lvl 15+(Uber 3 and up) the game starts to get pretty difficult. I didn't expect this with how easy the earlier worlds are, but it actually has some decent challenge. It has some good 8 man group content in Shadow Arenas, and soon they are adding Shadow Towers which I don't know the details of but I'm guessing its similar on a larger scale.I could go on but the game is Free to Play. It took me about 5 minutes to download, try it out and give it a fair shot you won't be disappointed.",1
18712,Star Trek Online,2017.0,"i am a massive fan of star trek ever since when i was a wee boy, and this game is amazing.

4391,Star Trek Online,2018.0,"It's a pretty good game in my opinion. That's about the best and worst I can give it. It's fun to go through the levels and occasionally nab a new ship here and there, though I will say it's been quite a while since I played it. I never got much into the clans and everything, but I really enjoyed the ship combat and felt like it was a lot of fun. Fighting on the ground was alright as far as I remember and building up your crew was a pretty cool aspect as well. I'd say it's a fun game whether you're into star trek or not. I, personally, am not much a fan, though I don't hold anything against the series, I've never found it to be quite as enjoyable as Star Wars. But that's just me.",1
1273,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI tend not to write reviews as I don't think it's possible to be objective unless you do it for a living, but I will say that this game really shines in a free to play but pay to win market. I nabbed it out of boredom on a bit of time off from work expecting to play for a few hours before I got hit with a soft cap where I would have to invest money to have any resemblance of not stagnating.Pleasantly surprised at how much the game rewards me. Getting a lot of cards from just going vs the AI which is great to see. There is a second campaign that rewards a new set of cards but costs a loooot of in game currency or the equivalent of about 8 euros. The cards it rewards seem just as balanced as the standard set and are definitely not in the realm of ""oh well if I dont have those I'm ♥♥♥♥ed"".I spent just under a tenner in the in game store more out of a thank you for the amount of hours enjoyment I got from the game thus far. Fair play to the devs to be honest.",1
2174,Path of Exile,2018.0,Yes. What Diablo 4 could be if Blizzard got their act together. Basically plays like Diablo 2 with a modern day MTX system for cosmetic stuff.

18353,DCS World Steam Edition,2015.0,"Ok so the game looks good and it is indeed a flight sim. The first thing you need to ask yourself is 'Can you fly a SU25t frogfoot?' if the answere is no then don't worry because there is a tutorial in place with DCS world that talks you thru the take off and landing procedures etc. So now you need to ask your self 'can you fly any plane whatoever?' if the answere is still no then here begins your problem because there are no tutorials available in game except a few videos showing you whats what which are next to useless if you haven't ever flown for example an F15 eagle or a P51 mustang then you will need to do your own research on how to fly them. I started the A10 campaign and managed to take off as the engine was already running but once I did I found that I was just a piece of metal in the sky because I couldn't operate any of the systems to use my weapons and even if I could I didnt have the first clue about how to effectively use them anyway. So why does this game get a 'thumbs up'? because it is a good creation so much effort has been put into this that it deserves nothing less, a 'thumbs down' would suggest a bad game which is unfair and I can imagine that when you take off in multiplayer with your buddy and fly in formation that this on it's own would be extremely satisfying let alone completing missions from the hangar to take off to battle and back to landing...I'm just totally incapable of learning how to fly an acutal plane without having actually gone to flight school first. This is a good game but requires a lot of work just to be able to do the basics.",1
796,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAlright, by all means Realm Royale is NOT a bad game. In fact, in my opinion i think it's actually a lot better than most of the battle royale that have been released recently. However, this is not a perfect game either, hence it being alpha while i am writing this review.To start off this review, lets begin with the pros:-Although it does inspiration from bigger titles like Fortnite and PUBG, Realm Royale does not have building and does not go stale like the other two big titles-The combat system in this game is fantastic compared to other BR games. You can pick from five classes such as Warrior, Mage, Engineer, Assasin, and Hunter with each having their own abilities, which transition to my next point-The skill system in this game is super unique, instead of depending on building or something odd/pecuiliar, Realm Royale is consisted on skills from the five classes of your selection.-And finally, theres no parachuting in this game, which in my opinion, is a fantastic thing for one making it alot easier to land but two it makes Realm Royale feel even more unique compared to other titles such as H1Z1 or Fortnite.Now time for the cons:(AS I STATED THIS GAME IS ON ALPHA AND I AM FULLY AWARE OF IT, MORE THAN LIKELY THE DEVS MORE THAN LIKELY WILL OR WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM THAT I THINK ARE IN THIS GAME, SO WHAT I REVIEW IS IN ALPHA STATE)-The loot is decent, however I do think it needs more work. I think it should have more greys than green, purple, or even gold weapons or abilities in the game to make it more balanced, which leads to my next con-The classes are super unbalanced, I understand that this is still in alpha and there are some flukes and flaws in the game that are just there. However thats not to excuse that some abilities or some weapons feel more powerful than others. For example, the sniper rifle for the assasin i understand its a gold gun however its one of the most common rare weapons that  I have stumbled upon to where it makes it almost unfun.Now my final overall opinion:Realm Royale is a fun game, its unique compared to other major BR titles, however it has minor flaws that it makes it almost the same as others. If you're looking for a completely different unqiue BR experience, do not goto Realm Royale with that mindset. However, do not let take away the fact that its completely unique compared to other BR games and probably has the most potential compared to other smaller BR games.8.5/10(I WILL STATE THIS ONE FINAL TIME THIS REVIEW WAS TYPED DURING THE STAGES OF ALPHA)",1

Really pathetic development, I honestly can not understand how it is even possible to make a game this inconsistent.More and more bugs just keep arriving after every update, good job on the idiot skins though guys.

1186,SMITE®,2016.0,"I probably sound like a hipster but i was first exposed to MOBAs during the time where DOTA was a mod for warcraft. Really had a blast playing those with friends during highschool. However i stopped playing since i was entering college. and that time Hon and LoL were popping out and bringing MOBAs to a whole new level.however what kept me from playing MOBAs again was the community. mostly toxic and it just doesnt seem fun.When a team loses, the blame game happens and alot of frustration. when a team wins there's still blaming (just basing on observation since my younger brother is heavily into LoL)Recently however my special someone convinced me to try out SMITE and check it out. at first i was hesitant but since it was a game we can play together i gave in and played. Best decision ever! the first few times i was mostly messing up. i was expecting abit of flack but to my surprise teamates were very supportive. heck they even said it was alright even though i made a wrong god position pic(that time i only know how to use neith). Win or lose everyone was congratulating each other for a good game. Though occasionally i encounter the bad apples but theyre far off in between and it rarely happens. i guess it boils down to an awesome community making the game fun for everyone. and i always try to pay it forward and make everyones experience fun",1
13274,Star Trek Online,2013.0,"As a player of some previous Star Trek titles (among them Star Trek Voyager: Hazard Team and Star Trek: Starfleet Command Orion Pirates) I was relieved to see this finally come out as a free to play (mostly) game.To be honest.... It's a good ST combat sim SHIP-wise.... It was reminiscent of STSFC: Orion Pirates, but with a 3D environment, and changeable ship components.... Which is pretty damn cool.The downfall to this game is the somewhat clunky environments otherwise... like ship interiors (which are massive... Hallways feel more like gymnasiums) and the combat mechanics... It works somewhat like KOTOR, but not as well. You constantly beat down a barrage of enemies that are all the same, and just clustered to get in the way of your objective... And the missions are always linear...In the series, ship captains are always making life/death decisions, finding diplomatic ways to resolve things, solving puzzles and trying to keep their crew alive in the face of danger. In the MMO, you are forced to either follow the ONE path, with no decisions on your part, or shoot all the enemies in the area to death before they do the same to you. No choice in the matter.Regardless, the ship customization (name whatever you want, even) and having that customization stick, and be displayed... As well as the tedious but flexible system that allows you to earn in-game currency and use it to acquire things without breaking your wallet is pretty awesome. For the customization of characters and ships, as well as the ability to engage in good ship to ship combat (for the most part), I'd give this game a good rating....I'll just be staying off-planet for battles as much as I can.7/10 for this one. I always wanted my own starship, and this allows for it for the most part. And it is fun to have your friend join you and captain the ""USS Ragemongrel""",1

This is true.  However while many MOBA vets find it boring, it is the twitchy, frenetic, reflex-based games like League of Legends and DOTA that I have never been able to enjoy.The ship classes are generally uncomplicated and it does not take long to understand the roles that each play.  While some classes are at an obvious advantage or disadvantage to others, no support ship is helpless, and no attack ships are insanely OP.In other words, the balance seems pretty good.At the end of the day, it's free, so if it looks interesting, give it a try.",1

17841,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewTrophy Bass 4 >>>>> current state of Fishing Planetedit - after 17 hours or so i'll say this... and i still stand by my initial review... the actual ""fishing"" mechanics of the game is OK so far. at it's base it's fun. but what makes it boring? shore fishing. it gets old pretty fast from static points. there needs to be boats, topographic maps, electronics, etc. i doubt we'll see it on a scale like trophy bass 4 where entire real lakes are mapped and you could travel to any point on it.the ""grind"" to use gear is fairly boring. it also feels like the fish Quality scales to lures you unlock. maybe there's some RNG involved to get trophies on worse things but i havent seen it yet. also the semi-forced ""you must fish varied species"" to level quicker is pretty Carrot on a Stick. im interested in bass fishing only. you should be able to grind the game fishing how YOU want to fish (""you can just way slower because one lake doesnt have a species you want to fish""). combining lures and different types of rigging... why use anything but jigs with hook guards for cover fishing? why can't i make a jig-n-pig combo? i can't texas rig my worms or tubes. what if you want to wacky rig? more casts... the casting is too generic. there needs to be flips, skips, etc, etc... a game made in 2000 has all of this - even if the graphics are way crappier it's a way more fleshed out game that creates a better experience of fishing simulation. ""ultimate"" fishing simulator is a very bold claim for what it's offering.",0

18302,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,"Radically different from the going FPS standard.A gem gameplay wise.It's free, there's no excuse not to give it a try.That was the short version.If that didn't convince you yet, move along.The mechanics the 9 playable classes are based on are remarkably creative and pretty unique:While one class is able to perform a Mario-style doublejump, another can literally blow back enemy missiles at their rightful owners' faces, and then there's a soldier whose playstyle revolves around surfing on exploding rockets' knockback - just to graze a third of the available characters.The variety in gameplay is still increased by unlockable gear for each of them. And believe me, whether you're going to fight your foes with a pistol or a glass of milk DOES make a difference.Talking about unlocks, a widespread disease of free to play games with unlockable content are those being ""pay to win"" options - not in Team Fortress 2.Owning more items than yor foe will not ensure you an advantage; either all their upsides are balanced by negative side-effects or they are purely cosmetic. This makes the game very beginner friendly because it prevents new players from being straight-down outgunned (additionally all of the gameplay-relevant stuff is easily obtainable for everyone; you recieve a free item every ~40 minutes of playtime) while it also allows advanced players to customize their characters to both, visually and gameplay-wise, better meet their taste.Combat itself too breaks away from the norm in many (positive) ways.There's a static health pool instead of the genre-established regenerative system, and although revolving around mid-ranged combat, this game shows a complete lack of assault-rifles of any kind.I guess the most noticable difference to other games of the multiplayer-FPS-genre though is that confrontations between players typically last significantly longer, with fights designed around the recieving party nearly always having a chance to react - which is something I greatly appreciate, for that's what I personally feel titles like Call of Duty are lacking.There's only few negative things to mention about the gameplay mechanics; minor annoyances such as the 'randomness' damage-modifier and an at times wonky melee hit registration (though, that's a flaw shared by literally every multiplayer game there is) are just that: Minor annoyances.Eventually they don't spoil your overall expirience.Although 7 years old, the game still is steadily growing and updated regularily, with bug fixes, balance patches, new maps, items and game-modes being released every month or two, ensuring you won't end up bored.So, to recap:Whether you are casually or competitively motivated,whether you like proving your skill against other players, or prefer fighting alongside them against hordes of robots,whether you like stealth, traps, mobility-based combat, or sniping,whether you want to beat your foes by setting up turrets or slapping them with fish,you _will_ find something to enjoy in this game.And yeah.The only thing it costs you is the time it takes to download.9.5/10, would will play again.",1

15396,Realm of the Mad God,2015.0,"Okay, were to begin, this game has just been sold to a new complany, so if you play or are thinking of playing know it will be under further development. This game is an MMO, there is no PVP only a realm (2-5 in each server) with a maximum of 85 people all fighting events, bosses, minibosses, gods and minions to level up, better their gear and of course complete all the objective to verse Oryx The Mad God. The game is a perma death, meaning if you die, you die, and no matter how many hours you have on that character, its dead make a new one. So when you die it can be quite stressful, panic-related shock and anger causing. Having oover 1000+ hours on the game it safe to say I have died alot, quit alot and restarted alot. The idea of the game is to get loot from bosses, better the teir of your items or get UnTeired items from certain bosses that are really good. Now the game itself is quite repetetive, so if you see everything once or twice, if you keep playing you'll ebd up seeing it thousands of times (thats not a joke). Taking into consideration the game will be soon under development, expect new things monthly even weekly. I rate this game 8/10 with friends (very fun and addicting) and 5/10 without (very boring). So if you're looking to play/invest money into this game as it is very 'pay to win', make sure you have friends to do it with you. Final thoughts of this game or rating is 7/10, highly enjoyable for the most part, would spend the 1000+ hours again.",1

At some point the cheap deck won't be enough anymore.Though I don't recommend it for another reason: I don't see a skill-based game in The Elder Scrolls: Legends.

8797,War Thunder,2016.0,"I started playing this back in 1.33 I think. Back then it was fairly well balanced though did have its issues. However, as of now, 1.55, the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The main focus of this review is aimed at the ground forces, but has some relevance with the planes as well.When tanks were first released, they were balanced quite well. You could go into a game knowing you could do well, regardless of which nation or tank you picked. Nowadays though, Russian tanks will one shot you, regardless of where they shoot at you, and they will bounce most shots you fire at them. Those shots that do penetrate rarely hit anything vital. For a long time I've defended against the whole Russian bias, but as of 1.55 I can no longer ignore it. A prime example is HE rounds. Russian HE rounds (designed for soft targets e.g. infantry) are about 4 times as powerful as any other country, this means even well armoured tanks will get killed by them.With the release of Brit tanks, we finally had something that could actually kill T-34s, but of course, they have since been nerfed, through either reducing armour, or by making rounds less effective. Fair enough on some of the ""updates"" they cited sources, however, they have not shown us where they get their data on Russian tanks.Until this balancing is address, I find it very hard to reccommend this game, which is a shame as the potential is there for perhaps the best game of its kind.",0
1877,Aura Kingdom,2015.0,"This is an Anime style MMORPG. The world you play in is named Azuria, the best work of a deity called Gaia. Somewhere beyond the sky, you find Aura Kingdom. A realm of light and spirit. Beneath is Pandemonium, a hellish place filled with undead and destruction. You find yourself on Terra, where these two realms clash. Terra is a place of wonders guided by Gaia's cubes, conveniently named Cube of Gaia, the mortal's link to the creative force of the universe. Allowing the creative humans, the powerful and pride Makar, ... to use magic, grand them wisdom or power.The story of the game is (no spoilers) you start with the obligatory, short tutorial. After you've finished it, you wake up in a small town named Port Skandia, memoryless of your past or was the tutorial a glimps of the future, can you change it? During the game powers of good and evil clash and you find yourself in the middle of it. Your duty is, not to choose sides, but to safeguard the people, flora and fauna of Terra.The game itself is very noob friendly, the main story line exists out of an enormous series of quests, which you will basically follow to level up in a very fast fashion. As in every other MMORPG, there are dungeons, which the main quest line will teach you the basics about. You can also do side quests, which wont give you that much experience, but instead will provide you with supplies or titles to improve your gameplay. The early game, you'll be probably leveling solo, getting used to the more advanced mechanics, the numorous classes and finding friends. Which isn't hard because of the open guild system where everyone can freely join a guild.The game has a pet system where the pets, called Eidolons, are an extension of yourself. They aid you in battle, grand you passive stats and some can even buff and/or heal you. You get your first Eidolon on account creation and you get two more while doing the quest lines. The other ones you'll have to collect key fragments for to craft their summoning keys.In general, the game is very fun to play, it looks gorgeous and will never get boring as there is so much content to explore. I have literally played the game for hundreds of hours before linking it to Steam and I still love playing it because the community and the world are still growing and more content gets added every few months. I suggest finding the class best suited for you and referring to the guides found on the aura kingdom forums (link below)For more information about classes, eidolons or the game itself, please refer to following websites:http://aurakingdom.aeriagames.com/                                       (main website)http://www.portskandia.com/                                                    (item & eidolon database, tools such as dungeon timers, ...)http://www.aeriagames.com/forums/en/index.php?f=2110    (class guides)",1

Some people you encounter are kind of helpful, say your running around and then a higher level guy comes alnog and you party up, theres a mentor option, and that bringgs the higher level player to your own level allowing you to get exp, because if not, you don't get the exp nor does the higher level player, but then they don't get the exp anyway because they out level pretty much whatever area your in anyway... if thats the case. all in all, I feel like its polished and would recomend (and yes, this revew sucks)10/10",1
9161,DCS World Steam Edition,2014.0,"I am not an expert on flight simulators by any stretch of the imagination, so fair warning, I may be naive or ignorant in my assessment of this game. That said, by far I believe DCS World, and what I have seen of its addons including DCS: A-10C Warthog, to be the most comprehensive and realistic modern combat flight simulator series I have ever seen. Many thanks to the developers for making the base game available for free on Steam. There's a lot included in DCS World to appeal to both the hardcore flight simulation crowd and to educators.There are some minor omissions and simplifications from DCS World's default aircraft model, the Su-25, compared to its DLC packages in terms of the compexity of the cockpit's controls and graphical complexity, but what is available is so impressive to me I can't complain. Even this simplified model is more complex than many flight sims I've experienced in the past.It's a good sign that some of the original companies which designed aircraft featured in this series are assisting with the development of the game/simulator, alongside the usual industry veterans. The sound design, user interface design, controls, mission editor and scripting system all seem to be quite well-executed. The game supports flightsticks, HOTAS and TrackIR, as well as (a rather inappropriate method of control in my opinion) the Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller alongside a mouse and keyboard.I've not yet completely explored what the game has to offer in terms of difficulty levels, or rather, aircraft simulation settings, but my advice is that people who are looking for a casual, pick-up-and-go flight simulator should do their research or probably look elsewhere, as the game may be far more complex than expected. That said, you can't beat the price, so I would insist that you test the game out and see what you think of it first. There's plenty of tutorials in-game as well as available on the Internet to help you become accustomed to the Su-25's basic startup/taxi/takeoff/landing procedures and usage in combat.If you are interested in online multiplayer, there is a thriving community of DCS World players online these days. I bet there's a wingman available to help you out.Overall, at a first impression I consider DCS World and its expansions to be an excellent value for its cost. I look forward to buying the expansions.",1

1171,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewWAS the Awesomenes Construction Simulator 2014. That is what this game WAS. Note that I'm a Tier 9 and have just recently played this game to update my review.I have Built:M-35 Mako from Mass Effect 1M-44 Hammerhead from Mass Effect 2.UT-47A Kodiak from Mass Effect 3.Terran Diamondback from Starcraft 2.Terran Arâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥e Mercenary Siege Tank. (YES. THE SIEGE BREAKER FROM WINGS OF LIBERTY.)But none of that matters when the base physics of the game have been modified from what was established, the weapons continuously nerfed until being 6 feet under, Rewards being lowered with ""Improvments to the system"", and a plethora of other problems.Back in early 2014 I STRONGLY, I repeat, STRONGLY supported this game. STRONGLY, I emphasize this, say it with me. STRONGLY... SUPPORTED THIS GAME. But with every step forward, FreeJam has shown they intend to take two steps back every time.- ""Clone Wars""So let's first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadgets that were originally available right at the start. This included the Hoverblades, Plasma launchers, Railguns, and thrusters. From level 1 upward of Level 3. Yes, this happened. Freejam didn't change THIS until 7 months later, when people stopped crying and moaning for it to come back.- ""Double Edged Butt-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ery""Now PRIOR to this, they also made some modifications to the reward system, adding a ""Repair function"" to the game, which put a drain on casual players Tiers 6 and up back then. What was the kick in the balls here? a 25% decrease in rewards. Yes, BOTH RP and TP (Robopoints and Techpoints).- ""Hero Zero"" Next up was the ""Hero System"", which allowed you to get the full RP and TP from a match you died in if your team won, but WAIT! ...At the cost of the entire reward system getting another 25% decrease. At this point, managing to make enough money to get new parts was an uphill battle, and at a 50% reward decrease that has remained permanent to this day, It's been a massive pain in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ - ""Turn up for Hate""Now, next up, THEY REMOVE repair cost, yet YET again, ANOTHER FREAKING REWARD QUANTITY DECREASE. You getting the pattern yet? Don't worry I'll explain it in a second. At this point, it got rediculous, but oh no, there's even MORE. - ""From Intense to Indense""This game was always a One-life team Death Match game. The ""Respawned and Overclocked"" update has killed everything that made it original and turned it into a confused MOBA wannabe. Even worse, is that they've now set the original mode, now named ""Classic"" So far on the back burner it can take from 5 minutes to 3 hours just to get on a match, gradually decreasing the time needed to even get into one with each tier you go up. But here's the final blow to the old mode: A 80% decrease at this point... To the profit you make from it. ""Classic"" is now as worthwhile as dumping yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in a toilet...Or on a development team. Think that's the worst part? Oh no. I'm not even FINISHED. - ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING KEYBOARD!?!""The controls with any movement design other than Tank treads will feel so obliterated you will literally ask... Yeah that's right, the subtitle of this paragraph. As of the R&O Update, Wheels are incredibly sluggish, Rockets provide minimal momentum, hoverblades are highly unstable if you lose even ONE, Aerofoils are a disaster to use, Walker legs are bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place, and believe me, it's going to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot. And LASTLY, the rotor blade design is sluggish as well.THISâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥GENUINELY BRINGS MY P!SS TO A PLASMATIC BOIL. THE CHALLENGE SHOULD NOT BE IN HANDICAPPING THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PLAYER. - ""GIVE US UR MONIES!""Why all the reward debuffs? Because they want money. They want to FORCE THE PLAYERBASE to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate. This game never DID have a fair free to play model, but it is now skewed beyond any conceivable belief. And also, No, it's not even classified as Pay to Win. IT'S PAY TO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PROGRESS. - ""GIVE US UR MONIES 2!!1""The introduction of Easy Anti Cheat, or EAC. Instead of using Steam's VAC system which worked very well and still mostly does, made no sense either. They decided to use a third party system, that not only people have always second-guessed, but never trusted, and never been comfortable with. You see where this is going? Yeah. They drove off a number of their player base stating, ""If you can't get into Robocraft to play because of EAC, that is a small price to pay for the issue of Hackers trying to ruin our game"". The only people who tried to help fix this was EAC themselves as I recall, and even THEN, only under the pressure of the Robocraft community, which had already started leaving. - ""GIVE US UR FERKIGN MUNEEZ!!11!ELEVEN!""WHY did EAC have to fix it? Because Freejam was too dumbfounded watching the stars shine out of their fat frigging assh0les to do it themselves, aside from the matter of the development company's profoundly horrendous inexperience in stopping hackers in the first place. But it doesn't even end there. They won't respond to crticism kindly, light or dark, which is why i'm not sugarcoating this. Not even an ounce. They won't listen to reason, no matter how kindly you put it. If they don't like yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you better be prepared for the ban hammer, because they silence ANY AND ALL FEEDBACK that involves any kind of actual review with a VENGEANCE. And hell, this hasn't even ended yet. Keep reading. This is starting to look like the Robocraft Holocaust. *shudder* - ""Nerf 'em to the Grave""Now, the FINAL kick to the balls here, and you might not get up from this one, is the repeated nerfing of weapons that have performed perfectly fine, and the buffing of weapons that never even needed a buff. FINALLY, there's the issue of rendering certain vehicular designs completely obsolete, promoting the uncreative design of Gun Bricks with tank treads, and tank treads only. I'll give an example. - ""From Speedy to Needy""I made a vehicle called ""The Masterkill B@stard"" (Frankly can't put the word itself in) Which operated on two things: Wheels + downforce, and rocket asssisted forward momentum. As of 3 days after the R&O update, my speedy little vehicle is no faster than a Treaded Tank, and that's WITH the thrusters on. I guess people can't stand having to exercize their arms, hands and fingers with the corsshairs on their Railguns and enjoy the game, because this actually happened. WITHOUT rockets, it's even SLOWER than a tank. Believe me, i've tested this one the day I learned of the horror inflicted on the Physics engine, which I think it's safe to say, it's nearly nonexistant now. - ""Final Thoughts""Lastly, like i said, I STRONGLY... STRONGLY! SUPPORTED THIS GAME! Hell, I even put $10 into this game just for hangar bays! But as of now? FreeJam has botched their game so much, yielded to the manipulation of their own community so badly, that it is nigh-unenjoyable. This game had SO MUCH POTENTIAL a year ago. But now it's all been dried up. Freejam has made it evidently clear they don't want to take a step in the right direction. A year ago, i'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10. But as of now, I can only - in good conscience - give it a 4 out of 10. A toxic community, confused development team, nonsensical gameplay, poor teamplay or constant nerfs as a double-edge to updates, and absolutely horrible physics engine tortured to death by modification of what it once was, ALL IN THE NAME, of staying away from making the game overall better simple for personal profit, keeps me from daring touch this awful nightmare any more after this. Stay. Away. From this hideous deformed child of a game. You will be stricken with it's Gods-awful MOBA wannabe gameplay.[More on my Review in the Comments section]",0
3548,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewDon't let them fool you.  11 Jul, 2014 wasn't the actual release, this game has been out there a few years already, just not listed on steam. And tbh they haven't made any real progress. The same old♥♥♥♥♥maps, the same 12 rifles, the same fcked up F2P economy.  You can't even Chat with the enemy team,  they have rent some of the cheapest servers they could find somewhere in south asia so a ping 80 is the best you can get in europe, 170 the average and over 300 if you have bad luck. meaning 1 of 5 servers is unplayable. And once you've joined a server you're trapped until the battle ends.this game had great potential, i was  so exited when i heard of it's launch, saw the trailer for the first time and the plans they had intented. But the developers attempted the F2P method, which failed miserably. I've no idea what this game is heading to but i don't think it will ever reach a finished state.",0
8229,Infestation: The New Z,2017.0,Love the game. Different people now own itthan back in the warz days. Patches keep coming cool new modes to play like the new survival mode wich is hard core lol. Great fun trading items and playing battle royale. game had the best water graphics ive seen in a game. Doesn't take a highend computer to run either. Just like any game out there just adjust graphics. Give it a try. is great fun. If you have any problems you just send in a ticket on the website and they help you resolve. also very acttive discord trading. especialy in skins. Crafting and new competition mode are coming soon. Can;t wait! i Like the game so much i even became a discord moderator. This is a free to play game. and definately a pay to win. Which i like so every one has fair chance. Check it out. great fun.,1
19620,Champions Online,2017.0,"First the good stuff. The best character creator I've seen hands down - for any game (MMO, single player, superhero or otherwise. Just the best). Both appearance customization as well as character ability selection are out of control levels of good. The game has a charming feel to it and achieves a true comic book feel as far as how the characters act and talk as well as how the storylines progress. Lastly, the whole game is 100% free to play without spending a dime. I never felt pushed to subscribe or drop any money. Furthermore, a lot of the games extras can be unlocked through in-game currency... the catch is, it'll probably take you an absurd amount of playtime to get it so you just have to decide whether you value your money or your time more.All of that said, there are glaring downsides. The community has dwindled to a very small but dedicated few. At peak hours, it still seems fairly empty if you compare it to more popular MMOs on the market at the moment. A sizeable portion of those who are left range from largely to strictly RP fans, so not a lot of them are actually playing the game. Another big chunk are solely focused on PVP so if you're looking for help with your PVE progression, you have to dig a little.The game itself can be pretty glitchy as far as things not spawning when they should forcing you to relog to fix the problem. The system set up to guide you to objectives is patience-testing at best since that tends to glitch out as well. Sometimes objectives aren't abundantly clear and make you feel dumb after you spend 5 minutes trial and erroring a side quest. Lastly, the combat becomes a repetitive rotation of the same 2-3 powers repeatedly once you figure out what the real damage dealers/support role abilities are on your build. That may be standard RPG fare to a degree, but you sort of feel it more here due to animations being frequently recycled.Overall, definitely worth at least a few hours of your time.",1
10854,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,i recomend this game so much i played it for 4 years now....its a great game but Valve manged to break the quick games switching them to casuals...it broke tf2 for me there is no quick games anymore you need to wait 10-15 mins to get into casual and comp matches Valve why?,1
2516,War Thunder,2018.0,"Repair costs are way too expensive, for exemple, you win a game and earn 20 000 SL, but you died two times so there is around 12 000 in repair costs, so at the end, you only get 8 000 SL, and it's worst when you loose.Also the FPE and Parts that are essential need to be free. I play this game since 2014 and they are right now doing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t not listening to the community. I hope they'll solve it soon, but right now, I'm really disapointed.",0
1862,War Thunder,2016.0,"Game mechanics are rough and not very responsive, which makes the combat very anticlimatic and removes the immersive feeling of being in a war. The visuals are decent, but also doesn't create the immersive environment and look very fake. I'm not saying that every game has to be realistic, but since the creators have taken this route, they should put more work into that. I have to say the developers have left quite a few settings to suit your needs, but for my opinion there are more cons than pros.",0
1506,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,"I'm gonna tell you something lad, if you're looking for a free amazing fps game then i'd gladly recommend this. Imma be honest if this game would've not been free i would've still gotten it.",1
2724,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAbandon all hope, ye who installs this wretch.With the addition of the ""Epic Loot"" update, things have gotten quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥. When a match ends, you get a stupid crate, which may or may not give you something that's worth a damn. You can sell those items...for about 10-20% of their actual price. Thank god they didn't keep the insane multi-million price tags for some of the stuff, because the most common item you'll be getting is low-tier gadgets and blocks, neither of which are worth a lot.Gun energy seems to be whacked. Being unable to shoot with more than half of the energy bar left is annoying at best and infuriating at worst.The devs care little of their game and their players and instead resort to petty excuses and dismissing reviews (like this one) and comments as ""boring"".Weapons are not balanced, especially considering the lag compensation system is not going to help you. How do you like getting shot through mountains?The screenshots on the store page are deceptive and are not up to date. For instance, the medic gun (which looks like it shoots continuous beams) DOES NOT DO DAMAGE ANYMORE.The worst part about the game though, is the playerbase. While it is true that they have complained about many things that really weren't all that important, that is not what makes them bad. Some people say that the players are actually 'better' than those in LoL or DOTA 2, but do not be fooled - the players here are victims of a lobotomy gone horribly wrong. You will face teammates that are insanely incompetent, making you wonder if they have ever TOUCHED A COMPUTER BEFORE. You will RARELY be matched with half-decent or even good teammates. Your teammates will let enemies drive by them without as much as noticing them, they will fail to assist you, they will ALWAYS have extreme tunnel vision - in short, they will ALWAYS FAIL. It is insanely infuriating to see them fail at the most simple of things, like, you know, shooting the enemy that's IN FRONT OF THEM!But this is just an early access game! Ofcourse people are going to hate the updates!Here's the question - How long does it take for a game to establish its ideas, its vision, its identity? Five years? Ten years? I think not.For a game as simple as this, staying in ""alpha"" for so long is simply shameful. The game had atleast 2 total makeovers to my knowledge. How much longer does this ""alpha"" stage need to go on? As long as the excuse can be abused?The removal of tiers, the tech tree, the megabots - some people were not too happy with it. I wasn't too thrilled myself, but I persevered. Epic Loot update? I'm afraid I can't care any longer, especially when the devs throw around passive-aggressive comments about their playerbase.Take the review as you will.Abandon all hope, ye who installs this wretch.",0
7779,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewRing of Elysium is easily 1 of the best or best Battle Royale there is hands down, it is compared to it's brother PubG, but advanced it and really mastered the perspective of a BR & Shooter, people into Shooters, this is a great introduction. The packs are another great edition to the game, and the helicopter finish is what sets it appart and makes it different and unique. All and all this is a great game and must play if you're a fan of the BR, can't wait to see what they do next, and what the new maps and updates will be like in the future. Highly recommend this game folks.",1
13618,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewPeople have been referring to this game as the free, and better, PUBG. Could this be true? Is it worth your precious 3 mins of download? Let's see... Core Gameplay It's....a battle royale game. I didn't expect much from it as I felt it was trying to copy other games just for that sweet popularity. I'm pretty impressed about how this game actually performed.You start off with a view of a map. You pick where you spawn, and you can see where others spawn. You have 3 classes, glider (you can jump and glide from high places) Snow Boarder (You can snow board fast down hills) and Climber (You can climb mountains and use the various zip lines placed throughout the map.There are an...okay variety of guns. It's not a lot, but it's pretty decent. I've encountered like 8 different guns. The loot spawns in predictable places, I think they're set to spawn there every time. Details The graphics are okay. I mean, there are particles of snow that pop up when you drive/run, and you can leave footsteps in a certain density of snow. Different textures have different sounds, and I'm shocked as of how realistic they sound.The gunfire has realistic recoil, and the guns are pretty detailed.The textures have 3 settings, low, medium, and standard. None of these really make a difference, however. Optimization Sadlly, this game is poorly optimized. The game stutters a lot and I encounter frame drops and rubber banding, even with an i7 and 1060ti and set to lowest settings. The game's ""minimum requirements"" are just basically what you must have to get to the main menu. Overall Well, the review can be summarized short and simple. The game is free, however it really exceeded my expectations for a free game. I can't really complain about the little things, the only real problem I have with this free game is it's poor optimization.Is it worth your time to download and play? I mean...yea. It's pretty fun, and it  pretty much is the free, better PUBG.  ",1
6187,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6LlRjblCuItf2 is not dead (yet)Edit:So I said that MyM wasn't that bad after all, but only with all the fixes that came afterwards.When MyM just shipped it was horrible and mm and casual were unplayabale.But the system works very well now and I start to prefer it over the old one.Tf2 is a really old game and it shouldn't have this many bugs in it, but valve just flooded the game with cosmetics and doesn't put much effort into anything else. I'm not saying the game is bad, they recently fixed a lot of bugs and when you play casual games it's still full of f2ps (which is a good sign). But right now the playerbase is decreasing. It's really sad considering how much effort this amazing community has put into this game (probably still more than the current dev team lmao). Tf2 is an old game, but that doesn't mean it has to die. This game could really shine again if valve would get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together.tl;dr game is playable right now and fun imo but devs are lazy",1
4333,War Thunder,2013.0,"Patch 1.37 ruined the game for me.  I thought that matchmaking was sketchy enough with the old system of 20 tiers of planes you unlock through nation EXP.  Now you have five tiers that you unlock various planes by using other planes or some such thing.  But what that means for me is that I have planes that were tier 6 previously being pitted against tier 10 and higher planes in the previous patches.  I am getting killed in basically one hit all the time, and it makes me never want to play the game again.update as of 12/20/2015:Game still broken, matchmaking is absurd, since the Ground Forces came out I was really excited for a ""realistic"" tank combat game, however, there needs to be a balance between ""realism"" and fun.  Right now you can expect to get shot right out the spawn and then (if you aren't killed immediately) you spend the better part of a minute waiting to repair whatever got damaged.  I'm sorry if I don't find waiting very fun.

2276,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI remember this game being fun in 2014 before the devs started to phase out the veteran player base in favor of casual gamers. It's still beyond me why exactly the devs decided to do this but one thing is for certain, they had already created a fantastic, smart and challenging game. Then they started to chip away all those little things that made Robocraft unique and enjoyable untill only a shallow husk of it's former glory remained.There are many reviews here that describe the step-by-step process the devs took to ruin Robocraft so for the sake of keeping this short i recommend you to read them instead. As for the future of Robocraft, nothing good can come of the ""new"" direction that the devs decided to take the game in. As of late 2015 the game has been slowly dying, i only hope that the devs see reason and restore it back to the way it used to be before it's completly dead.

UI is horribly slow with the over the top animations. There is no interuption cards as such, you can take your time with the turns. Only disruptive cards enemy can play in your turn are some special cards players earn when their health drops below certain points. Surprisingly many cards have random effects.Story mode is interesting and at start you will see your deck develop nicely. Then the story mode ends and  you are left with cards that most likely you are not able to create anything more than a few decks of copuple of cheap tricks. This is not just because of the few cards you have, but also because the cards have quite few and specific synergy advantages. You are then forced to take those decks to PvsP fights for low profits. Can't say if it is pay2win, but advancement will be very slow and frustrating without paying real money.Please play at least the free story mode till the end and try the PvsP fights before thinking about investing real money.

Your are unable to play for more than 30 minutes  and then there is a really good chance that you will get stuck on the same sorry server you tried to leave if you try to play again. They want you to buy a membership but the ratio of good server connections to bad server connections makes this a money losing proposition for you but not to the developers. Forget it if you live on the West Coast or even worse, the Pac North. Dont waste your money,, this game is dying and with COD world war 2 coming, it will be dead.",0
11070,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2018.0,"http://www.hardcoregames.biz/the-elder-scrolls-legends/this is a card game that can take over 100 hours playing to figure out, its free too which is even betterwhen the game moved to bethesda's loader was a setback which hurt the game's popularity",1
1802,Bless Online,2018.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI wished I had written a review about this game when I was actually playing it, but here it is.I do NOT recommend this game to anyone, and I will explain why I think buying this game is a waste of your money, as well as getting little to no return by investing your time into this trashcan of a game.1) As everyone has mentioned, poor optimization. But they're going to make another Bless game that will be on UE4, you know, what this game should have been running on in the first place. I have a setup that runs games on high-max, and I get frame drops terribly, at least someone took the time to inform players about an .ini edit. 2) No communication when you want support tickets answered. I haven't experienced this, but a couple of my friends did have issues with trying to contact a GM/CM about issues. 3) ""New"" content, which is just content brought over from the JP server. It's not ""new"".4) Promises not being kept. See #3.5) No GM/CM activity on Steam forums, even though this is supposed to be the main forum for the game. What a joke, I guess they don't care about a whole bunch of people bashing the game and/or possibly giving suggestions. Oh wait, they don't care about suggestions because....6) Emissary program was a complete joke, they kicked the people that called Bless out for what it is, a buggy, broken, sluggy scam of a game. I feel sorry for anyone who WANTS to help this game out, the devs clearly do not care.and...7) Gameplay offers nothing new, it's your typical, cookie-cutter combat. Translations are god-awful. PvP for scheduled wars were nearly non-existent on the low-populated servers (before the server merge, I quit ages before this merge). The population is around ~1000 players, and they are ONLY on Steam. This game will die out, give it a few more months, and it'll definitely be deceased when Bless Unleashed arrives. Do NOT invest money into this game, the funds are NOT going in to help this game get any better, Neowitz has lost a lot of trust and are a joke in the MMORPG community. And all of this is coming from someone who got Bless, as well as the Collectors' Edition, for FREE. I REALLY wish I can refund the game (giving my friends back their money) and not have wasted over 200+ hours on this disaster. Do yourselves a favor and skip this title.",0

2605,GUNS UP!,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI'm tired of this game.Not because the gameplay is boring or anything, it's just that I stopped up untill 4AM playing GUNS UP!, now I'm really tired. I would 100% recommend this game, especially as a Free To Play. The art style is superb and really fits the style of the gameplay, which is also magnificent. A truly unique game with no real downsides, never gets repetative, each base you attack gives you a different experience. If you have 400MBs free space, install this game immeadiately.",1
1836,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2014.0,"Good game, not bad that you can initially get it for free, but it has a classic part that you really need to buy the pack to make the game worth it, far too much is not available in the free part.

9317,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewBeen playing since alpha test so my hours don't really do justice but what I can say is that this game is a game with a lot of potential. The game devs listen to the feedback of their players and update regularly according to what they say. Although, the bad thing about this game is that the exp curve is really steep once you get above a certain level and crafting takes too much time. Definitely recommend this game if you like RPGs and don't mind grinding a ton. 10/10 for me.",1

I would have been happier if it was shorter or included deck construction though.They made the wise choice of allowing you to use the same account on mobile and PC, allowing you to play anywhere on the device of your choosing.Ultimately it’s a solid game.

Would recommend to anyone.",1

8124,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI've lost all respect now for the publishers, Tencent Games. I regret buying the founder's pack if you're just going to add a season pass and microtransactions. It's a shame too, because I enjoy this game a ton and it has a unique style which add to the fun experience. What was wrong with the crate system before? I loved this game because it wasn't trying to shove payments in your face like other battle royales (Fortnite, PUBG, etc...) but now that's changed. It's become like every other battle royale, a cash cow being milked to death. Although there are no issues I can find with the game, it's a bit frustrating to see the money I put into supporting this game just being used for stupid additions like microtransactions and the scam season passes are. How about a new map? New weapons? But no, there's just more cosmetics. There's no point in a rarity system because everything is given to you if you play the game. I preferred it before when you were awarded credits for doing well in your matches. The ridiculous experience system slows down the rate at which you can unlock new cosmetics, which is very unnappealing to new players, as they can only get 5-6 cosmetics before the season ends. At least you guys made the smart decision to let players keep the cosmetics they already had. It's really saddening to see that this is what I bought the founder's pack for and it's being used to create a system like V-Bucks and COD Points. If you want me to buy your microtransactions, bring back the free case system but allow those who help support the game to get some unique cosmetics. Please, Tencent. I really want to like this game because it had virtue before which was a nice breath of air from all the microtransactions modern games have. Please bring back the old system, but add new packs similar to the founder's pack. I cannot consider buying the battle pass because it's temporary and most of the cosmetics unlockable are recycled from the good ol' days of crates. This update truly scars the good nature that this game once had. The new UI makes things impossible to see in your inventory! Before, I had no issue seeing which gun had which attachment. This is a stupid issue that needs to be resolved, and I've never had this problem with any other game before. That aside, this game is extremely fun to play and very aesthetically pleasing. I would give the gameplay a 9/10, and only because of the tiny detail that the Ymir feels a bit slow in the beginning of the game.",0
1102,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"Although a decently entertaining little card game, currently, the Ring of Magica is overpowered to the point where you'll lose any game against a decent (not new-start) player if you start 1st. Serious balancing is required on that point.Also, the prophecy system annoys the living daylights out of me. (possibly due to the fact that my 'hero' refuses to pull prophecy cards when his runes are broken, and in stead, pulls them on his turn, making them less effective or fun to use, while my opponent seems to have none of these issues, but that's RNG, I guess..).As the game hardly brings something new to the table, I don't see it competing with Hearthstone, and with Gwent's release closing in, I have a feeling Legends won't be around very long.",0

3223,DCS World Steam Edition,2015.0,"Absolutely the best flight experience available on the PC.Here are some considerations:-It is a *simulator,* don't expect an arcade experience, even in the simple flight modes.-Combat is very real, and therefore very difficult.  Success is very satisfying, but be willing to take the time to learn how to succeed.-Despite some reviews the platform is exceptionally stable and functional, but the user interface is not intuitive (that's to be expected considering the scope of the simulation).  Again, it will take some time to learn.-Multiplayer is super fun, but know that it's a session-based environment, not open world.-Some modules (aircraft) will offer more content and detail than others, so do a little research before you purchase, and only purchase aircraft you are genuinely interested in flying.If you're a fan of aviation simulations, patient, and willing to learn, you will thoroughly enjoy your experience with DCS world.

8113,AdventureQuest 3D,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is my official review of ""Adventure Quest 3D"" a game by AE (Artix Entertainment) for PC and Mobile.This is a giant pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥  I don't know how it could of possibly been made worse than Adventure Quest Worlds, but you managed, so congratulations Artix.  I have expierenced alot of MMO's , but with a bad and clunky combat system like this, really bad player systems which could be easily exploited, and just an utter and boring grindfest, to the point where to even ♥♥♥♥ing play the game you need to turn off your brain and put it into robot mode. It becomes a bit annoying, to say the least.   maybe the first 5 minutes wasenjoyable, after that, nothing.The combat in the game has 4 classes (Which one is for founders only) Warrior, Rogue, Mage, (Guardian for founders).  All of these classes have 5 basic moves that cant be upgraded orchanged at all, and are boring basic unoriginal abilities that can be from almost any mmo or any kind of rpg game.  (by the way the ""1"" ability is your basic attack, so there's technically 4)It's also point and click targeted combat (Which isn't bad) but it's so clunky and just boring to where you can just sit there spamming 2 abilities that you prefer and win without even havingto think about it removes any challenge from a game which is something that a game needs to be entertaining in my opinion.  Also the game is a total grindfest, there is nothing to do other than kill monsters (99% of the quests are killing monsters too) you figure they'd at least do 1 thing in this game justice, but they really didn't.  for exploiting all you got to do is go intohigh level areas (accept a quest because there's no level or any kind of restriction to accepting quests) and walk over and hit a monster once that someone else is attacking, run awayand you'll get exp when it dies, rinse and repeat. The Variation of clothing/armor in the game, there are very few. and then a bunch of others (which are recolors of the very few)Oh and did I mention to craft them you got to go to a crafting person, make sure you have the materials, then spend gold to craft your item? and that it also has  a crafting time? (You can spend real life money to decrease the crafting time!) Seriously, this game is utter garbage, to think this came from the creator of the orignial adventure quest is really sad, andthe fact that this was released in 2017 is honesty laughable, it feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ripoff of a ripoff.If you enjoy brainless grindfests, then pick this game up, if not, steer away. 2/10.",0

5005,Robocraft,2016.0,"The updates ruined the game. - Everyone can have up to 5 types of weapons. - Before people had to choose single weapon which determined their class. I enjoyed this limitation, becouse this made everyone be more creative and more into the game. - No tech tree and tiers. - No more progression. Now you may grind, buy a weapon, lose interest, and leave the game, becouse there is no goal anymore. - Crates. Basically copying other games. I know they had financial issues, but that was the wrong choice. They incresed the grind. YAY, they are getting removed at least. - Medics ( previously my favourite class ) overhaul. When classes existed, medics had a pupose. Now everyone regenerates after 10 seconds, so whats the point? And not as satisfying or potent. This is equally important to making damage but the reward is multiple times lesser. - Self healing. Getting shot means less. Dont need to be as careful. Eliminates the need of medics. Lessens roleplay. - Penalties. Most of the time they punish needlessly. The game is buggy and requires perfect internet connection. Nobody has it stable.There are more things done wrong but that is already enough to say that this game which has great potential was reshaped in the wrong way, and now its just not good.>> Main mistake the DEVs made.

I did play this game at good length on mobile version, but I stopped when I got a new phone and... yeah ...So anyway, it was good distraction. I did spend about $25 or so into it because I did feel it earn my money. Now do I regret it? I suppose you can say yes. Why? Well, be warned.

9607,DCS World Steam Edition,2018.0,"Giving DCS a ""mild"" thumbs up. Be warned that if you intend to play, be prepared to spend many hours doing the simplest of functions, landing, getting used to controls, even firing weapons. It can be an arduous learning curve. My experience thus far has been in training or instant action trying to get it all down. It's not very intuitive or easy to do anything, so I think in the end, that sort of kills the fun, but it is a flight sim in part, so that is focus of the game. If you do not mind spending the time, it could get better I suppose. As of now, I am not having much fun other than flying the jet and experiencing that realism. The rest is a big chore.Update: This game is awfully difficult to pull together all the functions and have it be enjoyable, so I decided to quit while I am ahead and try an arcade flight game instead. Final review:Flight realism: 10Graphics: 10Action, fun factor and playability: 0Last category is why you may want to think twice about putting any time into it.

Although I have 51% and a 49% of kills which is quite even, the VS always seems to have the extreme hax.This game can run fairly well with 150v150(which is the most i've seen around 4 grids, however there are usually around 800 or so players on a single planet). Most factions have empire-specific things, you will hear the term ESF for example(empire specific fighter). However, some factions are also shared, such as the Valkyrie, Liberator, Flash, and some more which do NOT have empire specific things. The development and hype isn't as great as it was many years back, but don't listen to the guys saying 'oh its dying' it's not. not even close to dying.You'll be able to get into a full continent no problem(although there will be 1 continent which isnt as heavily contested usually), and updates are still coming regularly.Last I checked, steam discussions didn't have any moderation here, so it's no good to ask questions here(lots of flaming, bait, and trolls). Try their official forums if you have questons.You will want some pretty good specs (i5 2400 / gtx 1050 / 8g ram) for example, and that will only give you 30-50 FPS on most firefights involving 50v50+.

Getting 60-90 fps with my current setup.-Ok balance between classes.~needs a bit more tweeking~-Good overall selection of ships and skins.-Love the EXP and credits mechanics, which were nonexistent when I quit before.Con's: -Missing skins, What happened to the Ghost G-Type skin? Its missing from my invintory and know I had it before I lost interest in the game. Edit: Seems I was mistaken, I did not realize that there were two versions of the Ghost, one being the premium ship I got from Vangard and the one that you have to gain EXP to get which I believe would have the skin I thought was missing.-All I seem to ever get are EU servers, thought by now they would have implemented US servers or ones that are closerto the US for the sake of lag reduction for US based players, Honestly this is one of the reasons I quit the last time, No way this is on my end seeing as I have a custom gaming rig and over 60 meg line, plus, I have seen alot of complaints from other people about this in chat since I started to play again, really, fix this soon or you may loose more people again.-Price point. Price is perfect, IF and only IF the server issue gets fixed. Either faster server net speed or add US servers.-From what I can tell no way to make a 'Platoon of more than 2' in a group, I could be wrong since I havent invited anyone to the game.-Practice / Test area vs dumb AI to test a ship would be nice, which I would have thought would have been placed in this game, and the way the key layout is, would be nice to have this to test a rebind of keys on a ship.-Random Matchmaking throws me off a bit, I remember ability to create servers and and remeber the servers identifying as EU or US based off the host.----------------------------Not really a Con, Dev killed me.

It is pretty clear with how drastically this game has changed over the course of just a couple of patches that whoever is running things over there has no clear vision as to what this game should be other than a money grab. I am sad to write this reveiw the original DD was and is still one of my favorite games. They should call this game something else because it is not worthy enough to call itself Dungeon Defenders.,0

17021,Bless Online,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThe game had a rough start as there were a TON of players rushing into the game and the result was a large waiting queue and multiple restarts on the servers. Fast forward 5 days and server stability is much better and the game is a lot more fun now. The combat system is very unique allowing for a cascade of different combos to choose from and a ton of customization where the chances of even the same class being played exactly the same is very slim. I played WoW a lot and this game has a better feel for sure. I chose the 70 dollar pack and I enjoy the perks that come with it.,1

I would like to see different weapons other swords and explosives. ( like bows)3. I have noticed almost every single server i have went to there is always huge patches of snow and ice, small patchs of dessert and medium size of jungles. I would like to see more dessert personally. 4.

11997,War Thunder,2017.0,"This review focus is the ""Ground Forces"" in ""Realistic Mode""This game will give you..+ Insanely Beautiful Graphics (its actualy good as a benchmarking tool)+ The Most Accurate Despiction of Armored Vehicles in an online game up to this date.- Know bugs that keep unfixed for years- Bad and hollow gameplay mechanics, which remain unchanged since its conception- Absolute lack of teamplay and comunication.- Chat is used for cursing, and text messages are too simple and too few. (2000's BF1942 is better than this game in that sense)- Unrewarding and terribly long tank grinds, which also get interrupted each time a new vehicle is released- Non skill based gamplay, theres simply too many meta variables to consider this game a reliable competitive platform- Unashamed P2W bussiness model (standard tanks are no match for premium tanks and planes in the same tier and premium tanks and planes form the bulk of pvp battles)- Poor Match Making makes posible for people in Asia play in the same US server as people from South Africa with the predictable results...- Its almost impossible to get a balanced game, 75% of the battles get resolved in the very first three or four minutes, a single plane can wreck 3 or for 4 tanks and send those players straight to the garage forcing what lefts of the team in a painfully long defeat, you also get spawn camped very regulary there are no real mechanichs to prevent this, and the game forces you to spawn even if you are the last player and your spawn is populated by literaly every single player in the oposite team.tl;dr: If you absolutely love ""realistic"" tank battles theres no alternative to this game, if you dont, just dont waste your time on this unfinished thing.

16811,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI was pleasantly suprised by this.

15779,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,This game has potential but if playing the Ai is any foreshadow of how things will be against other players I will pass.

14167,Magic Duels,2017.0,"While the single player campaigns are fun, it's definitely pay to win.  The multiplayer isn't fun unless you're willing to pay for lots of cards, or play against the AI for more guaranteed wins.  OR, you can just play multiplayer over and over in the hopes the other player abandons for having a bad draw.My experience: I played through every available single player quest / training to get as many free coins as possible. I then played around against the AI in building the best possible decks with what I had, and then jumped into multiplayer. The matchmaking system is VERY simple.  You start at rank 1, and if you win, you move up to 2. If you lose, back down to 1.Because the matchmaking system is so simple, players who have paid for tons of cards / played for way longer can still be rank 1 due to abandoning a bunch of games in a row due to bad draws, or to artificially lower their rank. Because of this, even though I have a decent amount of cards as a free to play, and I play paper magic occasionally (so I've spent time creating the best deck I can with what I have), I still lose something like 80%+ of matches.Unless you are willing to dump money into this (why not just do that with MTG paper or MTGO to get the cards you really want), the main purpose of the game (multiplayer) is frustrating now.  I would recommend if the matchmaking was more sophisticated and maybe based on how many cards you own.",0
15554,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is, as a lot of people put it, PUBG but better in literally every way.  This review will mostly compare it to PUBG, sol people who already play it and other games like Fortnite/H1Z1 can know exactly how this is better and what's different/new to expect that you won't find in other battle royales. Note that I've only got a few hours of game time but I've got dozens more on the beta summer map. Pros:- It's free, you have literally zero excuse not to at least try it- Weapons are better, attachments go onto your guns automatically and should you change weapons, the old attachments will automatically transfer to the new ones. More balance, no more instakill shotgunning people across the map.- Only one map so far but it'll soon beat PUBG in this as well with 2 other maps planned, one most likely being the ""old"" beta map. Everyone complaining about the new map should understand that the old one will come back when it's ready.- New ""Classes"" for the winter map: Snowboarder can travel quickly downhill, glider can travel far distances quickly, and rock climber can climb mountains and travel around rather easily through predetermined ziplines that go both uphill and downhill. I imagine summer map and map 3 will have their own classes as well.- Spawn points. Rather than jumping out of a plane, you pick exactly which point on the map you wish to spawn at and are teleported there instantly at the start of the match. This also offers you an opportunity to know where everyone else spawns, and how worried to be about player activity in your spawn area. You can spawn away from everyone else for worry-free farming, or drop straight into a hot zone and rush the best loot.- Rather than a ""Barrier"" of some sort that closes in slowly in pretty much every other BR, this time (At least on winter map) the permafrost replaces a barrier, and it shows up instantly when the timer goes to 0. The frost will progressively hurt more as the temperatures drop.- The winning condition. Once the frost has almost envelopped the entire map, a rescue helicopter swoops in to rescue up to 4 individual survivors, or an entire 4 man squad. Anyone who makes it to the chopper to get those four seats wins, and by this point there's usually 8-10 people left so it's quite a battle to climb on without someone shooting you. This does, however, allow for more than one winner in almost every case. Some people will like this mechanic, some will not, but it's original and a good concept.- All the big cities have ""lore"" in almost every second house in the form of newspapers and journals, giving you a little insight into the map itself when you've got some free explore time. Cons: What are those? Besides some bug fixing, this game has none. Graphics are nice, music is nice, gameplay is nice, it's all around a solid game that teabags every other BR on the market. The only real con is that every other BR game is going to have to adopt a f2p model or go extinct thanks to this jewel appearing at the small price of 0$ for everyone.Other thoughts: The ice pick class is just straight up OP, you have absolutely no reason to pick the other two classes when this class exists. Not only do you have increased carry capacity, but your mobility is insane. You also don't need to be at the top of a hill to use this class, as ziplines go both ways and are all over the place. My suggestion to the devs would be to either make ziplines usable by all classes, or make ice picks given to everyone with the other two as extra choices. Alternatively, for balance you can add more ski-lifts and only allow snowboarder class to use them. I can't think of a way to balance glider, as it's only really good for making one trip down a mountain to escape the frost and then it's useless for the rest of the game. Jumping off a 5 story building will get you 50 feet, you absolutely have to be at the top of a mountain to get any use out of it which also limits your potential strategic spawn locations. ",1

2293,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Cute and Horror do not really mesh well in so many instances in gaming. This is one of those delightful exceptions, even if that's because the cuteness at first is then outshone by genuinly horrible things hunting you.  The 'Jumpscares' in the title comes from cheerful little carnival haunted house-style, wooden, pop up monsters that will appear starting early on.  The real horrors are more of the 'you can't fight it, just learn how it moves and strikes, and try to get away'.  This does not, however, in any way mean the funhouse pop up monsters stop showing up; even if you got used to them before, you are quite likely to get a startle when one springs up in front of you while you're distracted fleeing some lurking abomination.",1

3910,Minion Masters,2018.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewSince i got this game for free, my opinion is a little skewed because things are always better when they're free. Moving on, Minion Masters is a neat little RTS (Real Time Strategy) type of game where you take control of a hero and a deck of 10 minions, buildings, or spells of your choosing. Your objective is to destroy the enemy base using the fun-sized playing field. All you have to do is just place your card, and it'll do its own thing. With a fairly big variety of cards it'll keep you entertained just trying out how they can all work together. And if you're good at strategy/card games, then you'll have fun climbing the ranks and decimating all the noobs on your way there.",1
13347,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,,"Scrolls: Legends is a masterpiece TCG. It's easy to learn, fun to play, addictive, great graphics, mechanics, and unique in concept. As a avid Magic the Gathering player, Heartstone, and LOTR-TCG, I must say i like this one the best! The interface is perfect and the deck building is so much fun!  There is lots of strategy, luck and skill all wrapped up in one quite honestly perfect card game. Of course spending some money on cards, decks, and expansions is there. But there is NO trading card game that doesn't employ those tactics. It's part of the genre, so expect it. But i tell you, you can still have a blast playing this game, going through the stories, solving the puzzles, etc. without having to spend any $$$ if you want. But if you are like me, you will fall in love with this game and at some point might want to spend some money. The expansions are totally worth it! The multiplayer game system is grand and exciting! I love the daily quests and rewards. It keeps me logging in to play a few games and sometimes a few hours at a time. I also LOVE the fact you can play on multiple playforms, my iphone, Ipad, and Imac.... just login' and all your cards and decks are there, no matter where you play! ;-) My hats off to the developers!

20006,Bless Online,2018.0,"This is the first review I have ever written so I dont do this for no reason. This game has a lot of potential. I can feel that this could be a good game. But it's not as it is now. The game auto levels you and chooses your skills which i very much dislike. The game lags terribly in the main city which is normal in most MMO's due to the population. The difference here is I was lagging A LOT but i didnt even see any other players. The combat is very linear in the sense you hit a button and just follow the skill chain. Button mashing at it's finest. I looked in the cash shop and it looks very pay to win at end game. Honestly it was just sort of boring and with the lagging and the fact I didnt see a single other player it's just not fun. So, I do not reccomend this game. However, if you feel the need to play it I'm sure you'll make up your mind within the first hour of playing that it should be deleted from your computer and sent to the recycle bin where it belongs. Sorry Bless folks but this game needs a ton of work before it will be playable.",0

This is especially noticable in pvp, where someone the same level as you can 3 shot you in less than 4 seconds, regardless of your gear or skill level.This is also ade worse due to the class balance, letting some classes be 1.5-2x as powerful as others.

689,Bless Online,2018.0,"To everyone saying it is unoptimized, you can configure the ini yourself and the game runs great. Hopefully they will address this to improve the experience for those that do not know how, or are too lazy, to do this themselves. They also fixed the issue of players getting stuck on the splash screen on the official early access launch, and it was only a problem for the 2 days for those who pre-purchased. (And we were compensated for that with $20 of in game currency) I've also had a solid connection since I started playing with no lag whatsoever, so I don't know where people are trying to connect from to experience any kind of lag. As for the game, it is a blast.Combat is fluid, intuitive, and makes pvp really intense. The open world factions based (like WoW) pvp is always a good time. Can't wait for the upcoming pvp content in the next week or two. Sidequests are actually fun, but if you want to get down and dirty you can just start killing anything and automatically recieve a quest to kill that monster. (Pretty great honestly if you just wanna practice your skills and not worry about going to find a quest for a specific monster, you also can gain dungeon points doing these)Pet system is awesome, hilarious, and adds quite a bit of depth to the game. There are a crazy amount of pets/mounts to tame. You can upgrade pets to gain different abilities, and the same goes with mounts. You use other pets as an ingredient, but it can be a little grindy (it is an mmo). Talents are really fun, and what you craft is actually valuable/worthwhile. (There is also a secret resource dungeon you can find randomly to aid in crafting (; )Gear can be upgraded and infused, and talent upgrades allow you to shred even more noobs. It also looks great, and there aren't just a ton of reskins of similar items. There could be more sets, but what is there is very nice.I just hope they add more content like they say they are going to, as I will be here for awhile.Only complaint is nerf guardian, and add more stuff.

There have been many games that attempted to pull of the stunt that Nintendo did with the Super Smash Bros. franchise which failed, but I shall not name any names *cough* Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale *cough*This game, however, has a fine build and solid gameplay. I was hooked by the crisp HD 2D models and backgrounds, the balanced system, and the characters themselves. Sure if you don't play the training, you might get adapted to it rather slowly, but my first round on this game definitely showed me that in order to play this correctly, I shouldn't only rely on my Smash skills. I have high hope for this game and do wish to see improvement as I'm sure it is in good progress. Thanks developers for doing it right! :D",1

The register button is not working properly i guess, because i can't click it.Go to Arch game! wtf I just made my account on it (logged by facebook) but invalid password while login on never winter and also I didn't know my own password, arch game never ask for you to type your own password that I thought it was same with my facebook password.

16022,DCS World Steam Edition,2016.0,"If you want a flight sim that isn't as dull and dated as FSX or Xplane  then DCS is for you. However, all that glistens is not gold as they say... DCS has fantastic visuals and great professional flight models and the 3D modelling on the plans is superlative. However, many planes are still in early access and have been for quite some time and as such are not featured on Steam. Also as many of r/hoggit users would tell you, DCS may as well stand for 'Delayed Combat Simulator'  as the standard wait time for a two week release is about a year. That's not to say that there isn't enough to be getting on with just understand that if you're stoked for a new module you've heard about you may have to maintain that enthusiasm for a loooong time before you actually get your hands on the stick. Also, despite the base game being free, everything else is very expensive. The Navada Test Range and the new modules will make a big hole in your bank account unless you pick stuff up on sale. Two high fidelity planes in DCS will spank you for more than £60. So be aware, that while it's a great flight sim, it's a money hole. Do I recommend it? Hell yes. It's superb and enjoyable and the online community is great. Just be prepar3d to wait an age for new stuff and pay through your♥♥♥♥♥for it when it finally arrives (the game + all DLC on Steam will set you back over £500. More if you include what's not featured on Steam and accessible via the Eagle Dev DCS standalone).",1
308,School of Dragons,2015.0,"I think the game is great, but it's a little annoying that you have to be a member to enjoy the game. If you're not a member, your play options is limited.

20067,Dota 2,2018.0,"So I wanted to give the game a fair shot and I enjoyed it for quite a while actually and then it kind of all went to hell in a flaming car while demons sprinkled acid in to my eyes. Let me just say that the idea behind Dota is fun and its mechanically a good, if sometimes very oddly janky, game and if it were just up to that it would be fun. But its not just that. I don't think I've seen more people take a game more seriously and turn on eachother in such a way that is so cringe inducingly sad until your team loses every lane and you're forced to turtle the rest of the game out. I've seen death threats, people insulting eachother's lives and it just makes me wonder why bother? Add onto that the fact that games go from bad to worse when mistakes lead to uphill battles that can't be clawed back from and games in which you will literally be stunned for eight seconds straight and god help you if you fall even a little bit behind then because you will then not want to be in the game. So all in all I'd suggest you don't pick this game up and just let the community fizzle and pulse as it wants.",0

9138,Elsword,2014.0,"Elsword is really fun.Why?It has fast-paced gameplay, a plethora of characters- each having an unique class change with different specialties, a fun PvP system.The gameplay is fun. One might assume it's a standard button-masher, yet it is so much more. Variety of combos each requiring good timing for maximum punishment. The Characters- Each have their own fighting style. One could find any style to fit his or her gameplay, whether one enjoys shooting big cannons, stabbing enemies, shooting fireballs or arrows. PvP is exciting a chance to climb the ranks. Each having their own AP tier. Although it does have some lag and balancing issues. Overall it is a fun game and a must-play. Additionally since the NA elsword is behind the KR elsword the game is always being updated. This allows new content to arrive very quickly.If you are looking for a fun anime-like game, you should play this already!",1
10669,Neverwinter,2015.0,This isn't a bad game. It isn't a MMO. It's a hack/slash.  It is a pretty good hack/slash though! It has pretty nice graphics; an ok pay model; and good fight mechanics.

6161,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has so much done right.  Eliminated a lot of the RNG HStone cards bring .. yet fast play as HStone provides and extra depth that MTG elements bring and yet they failed to improve on the broken land mechanic of MTG.   Its one thing to win or loose a game because you are drawing badly .. or well .. yet to be completely eliminated from the match because 7 lands come up in a row ... I dont know .. MTG is amazing but after all these years you cant tell me someone cant come up with something better because its insanely archaic.  I have build decks explicitly on ""empower"" mechanics and yet there is enough stun / removal so that if you are only drawing lands .. you are dead in the water.  It just seems to happen to often.  Other than that the game is incredibly free to play and has done so much so well ... but the sigil / land mechanic hasnt evolved at all in 25 years.I still think this game is actually great but dayum the land draw is simply horrible and should be a side effect / board.",1

But overall from a gameplay and look's of the game is beautiful and I would go as far as to say it is better than PUBG in every way. At this point, i can't wait to see what the developers have up there sleeve and I hope this 'Ring of Elysium' will making big one day.I give the game 8 its made well, looks awesome and the soundtrack is one of the best game soundtracks i have herd in a long time.",1

My only problem with this game would be the ""page has stopped responding"" stuff. It might only be me but i recommend getting this game and giving it a try.A message to the developers: You guys should add in a singleplayer aspect to the game that doesn't require internet connection. It would be great for waiting at the airport for your flight or if the internet is down at your house.

Not worth it.EDIT: I just found out that the creators were paying off people to provide this sack ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥game with positive reviews. There is absolutley no game here whatsoever. You can't even call this a goddamn clicker game because it lacks any sort of goal. In order for a video game to be a clear and precise video game is that it needs to kow what it's doing. Shakes and Fidget does the opposite of that. It may be entertaining for the first hour but then you have to start waiting longer and longer to do the dungeons it just gets frustrating.

2258,H1Z1,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewPersonally I do enjoy this game and while this game certainly does have its ups and downs, I am not here to praise or criticize this game.  I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!Here are the ingredients you will need!Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.",1

The OP russain aircraft are so painful to play against, it almost literally gives me cancer, if it hasn't already.The constant patches and updates with un-notified changes to aircraft models within the patch notes is incredibly misleading - one day you could be flying along fine, then after the patch your aircraft could just fall out of the sky, it's wings could shear off just because you made a 2G roll, your aircraft could blow up just for looking at a russian aircraft.I would say play the game, just to understand what I mean by all of this nonsense, but I would also say do not even bother with it.  It'll be a waste of time.The jets too - well, don't fly any jets that are British or American, because they apparently suck - by the time you get off the ground, the entire russian team of MiG-17s will be on top of you, blowing your team to pieces.  Believe it or not, a Gloster Meteor from 1942 would fly against a MiG-17 from 1952 (for those of you who are not aware, huge technological advances were made in jet engines and aircraft aerodynamics within those 10 years).In fact, if you're reading this and you still want to play the game, fly as russians.

11152,Crush Crush,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewDEFINETLY the most moist game I've played this year.I could perhaps best equate this game to a bowl of TOP RAMENÂ®. Like ramen, it's a game that requires a certain mindset to enjoy, a mindset which consists of coming to grips with your place in life and understanding that, while partaking in this may devalue you as a person, you are still going to do it as a means of cheap personal gratification. It is also like ramen in the moistness aspects, a lot of animu grills do not contain what I consider to be ""just the right amount"" of moistness, much like how few bowls of ramen rarely deliver on moistness, but this game  and  TOP RAMENÂ® deliver the moistness on both counts.In terms of issues not inherent with the analogy, I must say that I can't get microtransactions to work.

However, when you want to squad alone and are being forced to with the new squading system... kinda... no IS very freaking irritating, esspecially when you want to play as tanker, and your friend is a rifleman and you can't squad because of it.

Not to mention this is on beginner servers for people below a certain standard of equipment and 12 hours of play time. Essentially, if you play without people on an empty or mostly empty server, you get to walk around a vast really ugly and repetitive map with highly pixelated textures on everything even at the highest settings, killing the occasional and exceedingly rare zombie, for which you get nothing worthwhile, or you can play on any map with players where you will be instantly and repeatedly killed, lose all of your stuff that no one will take but by the time you can rejoin the server will be gone anyway. The choice is yours. Personally, I recommend not even bothering to waste the data and going to play nearly anything else.",0
18553,DCS World Steam Edition,2014.0,"This game is one of the best free to plays I have ever played. Its the kind of game that you can play for hours and still not learn everything there is. I have played 26 hours at the time of this review and still haven't used the autopilot, weapon systems, and much more. Everytime I play this I seem to learn something I didn't know before. It does take a while to get a hang of and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who gives up easily because you do need to crash a lot in order to get a hang of everything. It is a game that seems to reward those who put in the time to learn how to fly specific planes because it has a ton of keyboard bindings, some a necessity some a conveniance. The planes you get in the free version do a good job at showing two sides of piloting. The TF-51D is a plane that in the game requires some learning in order to know how to just start it since it has an eight step proccess to start the engine. Once you get the TF-51D in the air it seems to be an easy plane to learn because it doesn't have a very high top speed and therefore has less you can mess up with in things such as landing. The SU-25T is completely different because it makes everything on the ground easy but once you are in the air you can break your wings off if you turn too sharp (which I know from experience). The community from what I have experienced is very friendly and I don't hesitate to ask them questions because they are helpful for the most part, aside from the LCtrl+e+e+e jokes every once in a while. Overall this game is great, it is a game I would willingly buy which makes it even better that it is free. If you would like a game that can teach you something while you learn, this would be a great game to try.",1

1565,War Thunder,2016.0,"You wanna good WWII combat simulator? I am sure you do, thats why you are here, isn't it?You want that game to be well balanced too, right? Yes I am sure you doYou want a game with no nation bias? Of course!Then why the hell are you looking at War Thunder? Seriously, go play one of the Red Orchestra games, they may not have planes and they may not be free, but they are cheap and have really good tank gameplay that is both fun and balanced and still maintain historical accuracy. In short basically everything War Thunder is not. The first thing you notice with War Thunder is what I call the 'shell', which is basically what you perceive, the shell is probably the best part of War Thunder. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, all the models for the tanks and planes are fully detailed down to every nook cranny and bolt; but then you play the game, the game is pretty fun at first but once you hit tier II-III, thats when the game starts to go down hill and that is when you really and I mean REALLY start to notice something is incredibly wrong with the Russian planes/tanks. Just to put it into perspective (this is a true story by the way): My Tiger tank was unable to penetrate the front of a T-34 at less than 40 meters and he was directly in front of me, he ended up killing me because the Tiger really didn't have over 100 mm thick armor and a ridculous gun, thats just ""western propaganda"" according to gaijin (I dont think they actually said that but it wouldn't suprise me if they did because that is their reasoning behind anything that is not Russian being under powered)  Another example would be the time I went into a head on fight with a Yak-9 in my Typhoon mkIB (Very historically accurate I know) and naturally I killed him since 4 20mm machine guns hurt, but while his plane was a flaming and wingless wreck he managed to get ONE last cannon round out which caused both my wings  and my tail to fall off and my plane was a flaming wreck just like his. Now that that is out of the way; remember how I mentioned 'the shell'? Well, the shell is not really there for most people, and while this problem has been delt with in the past it still exists, but what is it? Well, all those lush trees, bushes and grass can just disappear if you go into the options menu and turn down your graphics, and while on your screen you are very well camouflaged in your STUG III some Russian guy across the map sees you with your pants down looking like a drooling idiot. So how is the game developing you might ask? Well, the devs are just adding content and not really fixing anything, and the drooling middle school-age masses that is the War Thunder community is okay with this. Speaking of the community, lets talk about them. Basically the type of brain you'll be playing with are ones that are not developed enough to use logic and reason and if the match does not go in their way they will spam the chat all caps screaming at everyone who is still alive, its to the point where reporting these people is usless since there is so many of them and Gaijin doesn't do anything about them, thats why they are too afraid to fix the bushes and trees problem, they are too afraid to loose a handful of players. There are so many more things I could go over, but there are other reviews out there that will explain those things I failed to mention in greater detail than me.I will end on this note: I do not recommend War Thunder to anyone. There are so many promises that are unfulfilled it makes DayZ look like a finished product. And the sad part is: This used to be a pretty good game, but it has been on a steady decline ever since before they added tanks a couple years agoWell, goodbye my friends, thank you for reading this review and I hope it helped",0

4156,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter almost 200 hours and achieving the rank of Master two season's in a row, I feel like I can write a proper review for Eternal. This game is great. It's almost disgustingly free to play. You'll be showered in packs and cards when you first begin, and getting a free card pack on your first ranked win a day has kept me returning time and time again. However, if you're looking for a cheap alternative to Hearthstone, you're probably looking for Shadowverse. Eternal isn't an easy game by any means. The power system is very similar to Magic The Gathering, which can be very off-putting for anyone who hasn't played it before. I believe drawing mana makes the game more complex and allows for a wider array of decks than could ever be achieved in a system that gives you one mana every turn. If the occasional mana flood or mana screw really bothers you, this just isn't going to be the game for you. If you've been looking for a complex CCG with all the deep mechanics of Magic the Gathering while also being very generous in how easy it is to collect, I cannot recommend Eternal enough.TL;DR: Not great if you're just tired of Hearthstone, but if you're willing to sit down and learn it's quirks, there is a truly complex and interesting card game that is very accomodating of small budget.",1

18467,Cuisine Royale,,"Access ReviewThis game may seem fun on the surface, and why wouldn't it? Great graphics, guns sound great, and who wouldn't want to run around while wearing a pot on your head? It all sounds great, until you realize the game controls feel like they were made for an Xbox controller, and climbing up ladders is absoutely abizmal. My friend and I came across a couple of bugs, the first bug we came across, I was on top of a car while my buddy was driving it, and he all of the sudden died, and it said it was ME who killed him. Another bug we came across was when me and him were crossing a bridge, and I just suddenly phased through the bridge. I couldn't move, I couldn't jump or prone or do anything to get out of it. The only reason why I was able to get out was because my friend drove up to me with a vehicle and I was able to get into it. If I was in a solo match, that match would have been done right then and there. On top of that, people are running around rampant with a golden pan that 1 shots people. In conjunction with them equipping boots of speed, which makes their movement speed 10x faster, virtually making them unkilliable. There are arguments on forums and threads saying ""git good"" and that would be true, IF IT DIDNT 1 SHOT. Atleast the framerate was good, and the sounds were awesome. There is talks of hackers running around as well, however, I've never seen or caught anyone that was FOR SURE hacking. I mean there were some pretty fishy moments but nothing really solid. This game has a ton of kinks that need to be ironed out. TL:DRPro's: Good graphics and soundsCon's: 1 shot weapon in a battle royale game (seriously what were you thinking), game breaking bugs, and controls.",0

6045,SMITE®,2018.0,"Pretty good game. It's free. I think the only thing thats worth putting money on is the ultimate god pack because it gives you every single character for free.  makes the game more interesting and less grindy. Typical moba except its more emphasis on the skill base. Balanced better than other mobas imo and is pretty fun. Don't be a toxic player, learn from your mistakes and you're bound to have a good time! The devs are meme lords and push skins in chests that can be obtained through money, which is kind of dumb in my opinion, but if you really care about the game its your money. I haven't encountered any horrible game breaking bugs but I do know that the devs are constantly pushing new content out which is nice in comparison to other games that take forever to release new characters or content.

892,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2015.0,"Well... No. At this (as they say) early state of development there are many reasons to just say 'no' to this game. I played a whole lot of racing games and racing sims and still I'm not fully aware where to put it Raceroom Racing Experience in. Sometimes, driving in R3E feels reasonably realistic, sometimes it's ridicoulusly arcade-ish. Let's have a list of good aspects of R3E; There is a great AI, which often fights and struggles the same way you do. I don't want to say that they're completely flawless, hell no, but compared to other racing games, the AI in R3E is damn good.The tracks come in a very polished manner and for me it was a pleasure to see such detailed tracks, full of life. Codemasters still does a better job in this but well, you can't be good at everything, right? Also the cars look nice - not great, but nice. It's pretty hard to say when it is ""enough"" regarding details, because theoretically it's never enough if you want to simulate things. But sure there are restrictions in terms of hardware resources. And it's 'free' to play, so they want to reach a big audience of course.All along the words 'free to play' is the biggest flaw in here. When you first download the game, there are waiting 2 cars in your garage on 2 tracks, with 3 and 2 versions of it. Of the the tracks is a R3E Fantasy track, which - don't get me wrong - is damn good.Sector 3 Entertainment offers a test-drive in every car you may want to drive, at least. But let's face it - if you want to have a full garage, you're about to pay at least 120€, which is too damn high, considering that the cars are not even realistically balanced or even physically correct - yes, they are nice, but nice doesn't want me to pay that much money. I purchased the ADAC GT Masters 2014 Package, the Hillclimb Package, as well as the track Bathurst and the Ruf GTRS12 (basically a Porsche 997 GT3). Hell yeah it was worth it, I had some fun, especially on Bathurst, and with some of the GT Masters tracks and cars... But the game still feels incomplete, everywhere pops up a ""BUY NOW"", ""BUY NOW"", ""ON SALE"", ""ON SALE"", advertisement everywhere - incredibly annoying. I don't think that they ever change this, so this alone is a reason to give it a 'no'... On top of that comes the questionable physics and behaviour of some cars and the lack of settings of track conditions.Oh and it was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to get my Force Feedback into a playable state, although it fully supports my Logitec Driving Force GT (I know, it's far away from being the best, thanks! :D ), which to me was a antipathic moment, also...Go download the thing and try it yourself, but invest some hours before you buy something.",0
17907,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,"Been playing since 2015 [mobile device then] with over 13 K battles. Still is a good game.Simple to learn, hard to truely master. Balancing? Some would complain, yet War is never fair. Gameplay is enjoyable to an extent with multiple maps and tanks. Grinding could take time however, events could be dislikeable to some. A number of toxic players now and then and pricy tanks. Most battles are different. Sadly, depending on the person, sometimes it's frustrating like RNG. Not much else to complain. Blitz is a fast paced game.When it first came out in 2014, originally was mobile. Take note however, this could be outshined by the PC and Console versions in graphics, game, content, and that sort of stuff, so you could have that, if your PC can handle, it's less demanding.

8743,Star Trek Online,2015.0,"This game at it's current state is pretty darn good. And I say this because of many reasons like:1. The story is intriguing and it has that little something that keeps you going through it. They reward very good loot(some of them) when you replay them at max level, which is 60. Yes, you can replay almost every episode(missions). New episodes are added regularly. The story captures the feel of the Star Trek universe pretty well.2. The combat is good at the start, but it can get boring if you don't have a good build. There are many builds out there and there is one for you for sure. Ground combat is not the best, but not the worst either. IMPORTANT!  The game relies on DPS a lot. It is possible to be a healer/tank, but you won't influence the battles that much.3. The game is massive. Sector Space is huge with a lot of Systems including Sol System, Qo'Nos, DS9, Drozana Station and the new Delta Quadrant is awesome. There are tons of things to do in the game, from crafting to grinding Energy Credits(in-game currency) to building your Fleet Space Station and other Fleet buildings. 4. One of the best things with this game is that you can get Zen(the most important currency) in two ways:a. Buy Zen with money. ORb. Grind Dilithium, which is made from quite a lot of activities in-game. There is a Dilithium exchange market controlled entirely by players like a stock market or a bank. You buy Zen for Dilithium or vice-versa. That makes Dilithium a very important currency. You are capped at making 8.000 dilithium per day per character though. But you can make other characters and transfer the dilithium to the character you want. Zen is the only currency account-wide.",1

6419,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is an incredible card game all around.Similar to Magc: the Gathering in many ways, Eternal streamlines the formula and adds its own twists to make a game that plays faster, more balanced, and with deep strategic interplay both over the course of individual games and in deckbuilding.Eternal rewards skill and strategy, and thanks to its generous free-to-play system skill really does matter (easily the most generous of any card game on the market - this game is actually free to play, even at competitive levels).For existing card game fans, this is a masterfully designed game that takes existing concepts and improves them while adding its own spin.

15559,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2014.0,"Lord of the Rings Online, or Lotro is one of the older Mmorpgs out there. Like the name of the title suggest, this game plays out in Middle Earth where you can play as a Hobbit, Human, Dwarf or Elf. Each race has its own background story but will eventually merged in to a in my opinion Rich storyline where you help the people of middle earth and the fellowship of frodo and his companions. If you are a fan of the movies like i am then it won't take long to fully emerge your self in to this game and even learn new things about Middle Earth it self.So...? What can you expect from this game then? As for Dungeons and Raids nothing to challenging, wich in my opinion isn't all that bad, i have seen other games where they make it so damn hard people just rage quit or can't be bothered to play it after a hard day of work or school. What is new (mostly for ppl that used to play this game back in the days) is that deeds (kill for instance 200 orcs or complete 30 quests) are much more important then before and for ppl that are looking for a quick breeze through the game for max level and then hope to enjoy the end gaming this is made possible (unless you invest alot of $ in the online shop)For player activity? I Am playing on the europe server Snowborn and there is lots of people online, never had a moment where i didn't meet someone while playing.Free To Play version of the game. You may or may not ask you self, Is it playable with out spending a Dollar. The answer is NO. Some of the expansions aren't free, and if you're not in the mood to grind deeds with multiple character you miss out on a lot of coin that is needed to unlock many things in the online shop. Ultimately whether or not you choose to play this game is up to you. Like i said above, It maybe free but you gone spend money in the end anyway, that is if you want to see and be able to do everything this game has to offer. Other then the financial aspect its still on of the better online games out there and i'm sure with the release on steam the game will get a boost in player numbers, so in the end i give it a YES on recommendations even with cash you most likely gonna have to spend.",1

20296,Magic Duels,2017.0,The game is great. I started playing magic long time ago and now I'm back enjoying it.

Why old boosters don't get a discount? It's a pain,1
10366,EverQuest II,2014.0,"Okay. Here goes.I may have played this game for 2 hours in all, butthat was because my computer crapped out on me and i had to put it in the shop.AFter two weeks, it came back to me, completely wiped to factory specs because of a nasty virus.Two hours of gameplay, however, is enough to me to recommend this game.The character customization itself is enough to keep me occupied for 45 minutes or so, as there are a large number of races that include the ""average"" fantasy races like dwarves, wood elves, dark elves, and even two different kinds of fae (we'll get into that in a moment), but there are also unique and interesting creatures like the Frogloks (good aligned frog people), Ratonga (Rat folk the size of dwarves) and two different species of lizardfolk.Also, this game gives you the option between good and evil. there are a surprising amount of evil aligned classes (and good, too, for you light siders out there) and the choice of alignment changes starting areas and such.The deity you decide to worship (much like neverwinter) will give you buffs and items. UNLIKE neverwinter, the deity you worship actually matters in the game. Depending on the amount of of worshippers, the god or goddess can materiallize in the world as an Avatar, giving server wide buffs to worshippers and offering quests.And if you're like me, you will want to spend thousands of hours playing this game purely because of collectables. Artifacts and books (much like Rift) are scattered everywhere, and they seem much more common in this game than in Rift. I can't really walk 40 feet ithout finding something interesting, whether that's an artifact, wierd enemy, or absolutely beautiful view.This game is VERY pretty, in my opinion. I have it on lowest settings because of preference (I want performance, not quality) but I've seen some things in my TWO whole hours that make me think ""Wow.""The good starter area, for instance, is on an icy continent/island/archipelago thing, and the ocean is VERY deep. I was a froglok, so i could breathe underwater, and i stopped before finding the bottom because i kind of wanted to play instead of swim downward for a lifetime.Definately give it a try, better than WOW in my opinion, mostly because they don't try as hard to suck every penny out of you.Yes, there is a cash shop, but you can definitely play without spending a dime. I know, i looked around in it.",1
19441,AdventureQuest 3D,2017.0,"Early Access Reviewi personally love the game, for those idiots who hate it cause of the continues grinding or lact of content, you should remember the game is still growing, so shut up and wait.other than that i  dont have much to say. oh and dont be fooled by the amount of hours spent in game. i dont play it through steam.",1
9373,Magic Duels,2016.0,"For magic lovers like me, Magic Duels is a right step on the right direction (even better than magic online sometimes). Main problem with the game right now is the limitation on online games where ragequitters still have a small benefit leaving the games.",1

19059,School of Dragons,2015.0,This game is amazing i love the How To Trian Your Dragon movies and shows and this is just the kinda game is was looking for even though i wish they had put more quest to get dragon eggs in the game i still love it and enjoy flying and playing games with my friends on our very own dragons.,1
17134,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game is certainly the one-of-a-kind third person games.Like SMITE, it changes the tower defense genre by making it third person, making the experience great.recommended for users who love TD's and third personKnowing there's bugs within it being early access, I've had problems with loading screens.It kept saying loading, and not taking me where I needed to go for the next area.",1
1288,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2014.0,as the name entails the game is based around disassembly of the guns and although that is fun and its a great game it has a major downside where you actually have to buy each individual gun and it needs to connect to the servers to play so you cant play offline it feels like more of a educational game for gun lovers than anything still if youre hoping to learn about guns this will do it,0
11377,War Thunder,2014.0,"Game has gone downhill since patch 1.35 and at this point almost has no point in playing.

No thanks, sorry on this one Gaijen, you messed up.",0
15597,War Thunder,2018.0,"The gameplay itself is fine (I have at least 200 non steam hours), but the grind, repair costs (for some vehicles), and the fact that Gaijin has gone full Stalin(i.e, censoring critical forum posts, mocking the community, and just generally not caring https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8XKXUDQXRU) kinda makes me not want to play it that much anymore.",0

1912,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWas excited to play this game, got into it and had a long queue time to be able to play. After a 3 hour wait time the devlopers itself said they server locked the server i queued up for. Wasted HOURS in just trying to make a character, but then wasnt even able to make a character. Very poor English Translations, one quest i spend 15-20 mins on just trying to make sense on what it wanted me todo. It said something along the lines of '310>click' WHICH MAKES ZERO SENSE.There also locks on 3 classes but you still get drops for those classes in game, everything about the game is poorly made.4-5 hours is spent in trying to get in and make a character just to have a poor run game when you get into it.4-5 hours wasted just trying to figure out what the english means + lag of the overall game.They even begain locking servers since they cannot handle people in servers.This is the first time i have been really upset at a mmorpg.",0
2068,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI love this game even though its a Early Acess  im sure it will get better as it progresses, Highly addictive and real fun . only downside is there are D.L.Cs which are a bit  expensive But apart from that if you Like fishing and got a few hours to spend  get this game",1
2207,Shadowverse CCG,2018.0,"NOT recommend for variety and balances.Variety? nope, only 1-2 playable type (unless you're memes player, the best kind). This IS SHADOWverse, not a FORESTverse, DRAGONverse, PORTALverse, BLOODverse, RUNEverse, SWORDverse, HAVENverse nor NEUTRALverse, best not to say BALANCEverse.Ugly human anime arts (girl especially. I'm biased, YMMV) but Good Dragon (non-girl human anime with 'dragon' features abomination) and Monster related arts, though, and best of all, it has Jabberwock The Nightmare Handsome Spawn ❤.Oh, and this is Japan game, so expect no community feedback.Read someone reviews else for more information.",0
6328,DCS World Steam Edition,2013.0,"if you like some combat flight simulators and dont want to buy one, get it... if you are searching for an Air Combat game, dont touch it...to many control-options for my taste, and no real Tutorial showing you how, which means, read the manual =/",1
13208,World of Warships,2018.0,"Great Game except the annoying match making, ie Tier 6 vs Tier 8 or worse still Tier 8 against Tier 10.  I know its balanced out within the team but for the players that come into a game with a lower tier ship against a superior ship is not my kind of fun. Tier 8 does not exist anymore because your guarenteed to be put in a Tier 10 Battle. My other gripe is that when you work your way up to a desired ship that your after that has just been released, weeks later they will nerf it so all that hard work into thinking your getting the ship that was reviewed is removed, they should fully test the ship before reviewing it. Numerous occations i have worked hard to get these ships then in comes the nerf which makes the ship totally crap.Other than these gripes the game is awesome, i have played since the beta and have progressed through most of the ships. Best Warship game on the market!",1
8251,Brawlhalla,2018.0,"By god this is one of the most fun party games you can play with your friends online or locally. The gameplay is good, there's a lot of character/weapon diversity, and reading opponents can be very satisfying. But. And this is a MAJOR but. If you try and play this game by yourself to climb the competitive ladder, the salt starts flowing like the ♥♥♥♥in' dead sea. The community is extremely toxic (almost every opponent is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in post-game chat), the matchmaking is complete garbage, (fighting against players who are 200 more elo consistently), and passive play reigns king. If you have friends to play this game with casually, by all means, go for it. But if you're looking for a competitive fighting game, this game is simply not worth it.",0
2772,Magic Duels,2016.0,"Product received for freeLots of problems with the campaign deck design. The game gives you your own collection, and encourages microtransation purchase of virtual packs, but then gives you a sizable amount of campaign scenarios, where in all of them you are forced to use their preconstructed decks, which at least 80% of them are filled with unfun garbage. For a game designed for appealing to beginners, it debuts and shows off a spectrum of bland and unspectacular cards like Drownyard Explorers, Shambling Ghouls, Fire Elemental, Carrion Crow. I was enraged to see Nephalia Moondrakes as Innistrad Jace's 'big' card. The Origins campaign, spare much less than half the battles, were insufferably boring. Liliana's decks in particular were very bland and very much worse than what you were facing, up until the last battle, which was actually well done. Gideon was boring, Chandra, for a 'burn deck', saw a distinct lack of burn spells, and a lot unspectacular creatures. Nissa's deck was usable, and what should be the bare bones standard for entertaining design, and Jace's campaign managed to have the only consistently fun deck and gameplay. The Shadows Over Innistrad challeneges were quite bad with a few exceptions: Jace and Tamiyo vs Avacyn had a good decklist, Sorin vs Avacyn would have been a great fight; Sorin had a very fun deck, but Avacyn's deck was very underwhelming and very squishable, I replayed that battle twice, wondering where her threatening cards were and found none. Jace's deck proved to be very slow and bland against all aggro decks, I had no fun with it until a brand new Welcome to the Fold was put into his last encounter. I actually do not have complaints about the Zendikar campaigns; Gideon's decks were actually good and fun to use, and the very last battle against the Eldrazi titans was very well done and very fun.The storytelling was adequately executed, I am generally satisfied. The game engine appears to be the same Duel of the Planeswalkers engine that has been used for years. I think it does have some issues regarding the game atmosphere and feel; the effects and card animations have lingering, floaty animations that confuse or lag, rather than impress, or appear 'magical' or whatever the intent was. They aren't inherently bad, they are well done for the intent to be floaty or slow, but they are frustrating when you are in a boring spot, or losing a match. In particular I feel the drawing animation should be much more concise. Sometimes some cards fly erractically (I experienced this when opponents used cards with madness effects in the Innistrad campaign), linger and wait for your acknowledgement, or don't linger and wait for your acknowledgement when you expect them to. For magic's complicated design and arcitecture, the engine executes it fairly well, with a few occasional hiccups. I find myself occasionally having just not enough time to respond to a spell or ability that I really intended to respond to as soon as I noticed my opponent's move, while sometimes feel frustrated waiting for priority to tick away while either me or my opponenet have no mana untapped. This is less of a criticism, I imagine priority is a part of mtg that is a nightmare to design for in a game. I feel the use of the space bar handling both pausing the timer and passing priority when appropriate was handled fairly elegantly, and should have been noted at some point in tutorial dialogue.I had two technical problems: I had some problems with a glitch in the graveyard browser, several times while I tried to make a decision while one of my spells was resolving, I tried to minimze my spell, and when I entered the graveyard broweser, no cards showed up. This happened every time I tried, and robbed me of information I could have used in gameplay decisions.I had several crashes in Chandra's campaign against the Lieutenant. I am sorry that I don't have any information on what could have caused the crash. It was mildly frustrating, but I managed to make it past the node on about my fourth time. The good news is that these were really the only glitches I encountered in a very expansive and complicated system. I do fairly often get screwed by the game skipping phases when I have activated abilities I want to use on my turn. I don't have an exact example at the moment, but several times the game skips phases on your turn when you don't havve creatures on your turn, and I have wanted to activate draw effects and hopefully draw a land to drop, but the game will skip the phases so quickly that by the time I can actually pause the timers to activate my abilities/cast my instants, it's already the end step on my turn. The ingame popups while navigating the main menu are really annoying, and have yet to actually pique my interest in anything they state. The game has spammed me with many popup informing me of a reward for beating the Gideon campaign, which was something I claimed within the first hour of the game, and irrelevant like, 4 or 5 times they informed me of it.The deckbuiliding UI is pretty bad, filters for only colors, nothing for rarity or card effects. Finding the way to name and change the picture for my deck required me to look online, and was very unintuitively placed. You should be able to favorite cards to find during deck construction. I didn't buy any packs with real money, and I am already swamped with how many cards I have to wade through, the system really needs improvement. This game makes a critical mistake that is very common in the video game industry, and that is hand-holding new players with tutorial messages. It is very patronizing to players when games decide we are not intelligent enough to figure out mechanics on our own. I am playing from the prespective of a veteran player rather than a beginner, so I am predisposed towards not needing the tutorials, so my criticism will be biased, but I do feel that a better design would be painless for a seasoned player as well as accessible to a novice. I feel the bland preconstructed deck construction is also tied to this 'tutorial' mentality, that starting players cannot handle flashier or more powerful cards for some reason. I feel this decision is not only mistaken, but detrimental towards the starting player's excitement and motivation. I feel that Wizards puts a considerable amount of thought in how to introduce new players, and this overcaution has hindered the game's enjoyability and viability as an introductory tool. The new design of their pay model is very interesting. Though I tend to dislike freemium-style, free to play games, as they prey on whales, I think it's ultimately Wizards/the dev team's prerogative for how they decide to monetize their game. I think the current design is more advantageous than the previous model of buying the complete game, given that they can use Magic: Duels as a tutorial/introductory tool for bringing in new players to the game in reality. While I feel that duality in functionality was a smart design choice, I think the game is ineffective its execution, as I stated in the above paragraph. I would feel more inclined to purchase packs if I felt owning these virtual cards meant anything; they will be outdated once Wizards releases whatever their next game is. The packs purchasing mechanics also comes with a very slow earning of packs with ingame currency, which for me at least is a bit daunting and discouraging. In summary, some things about this undertaking were done very well, more things were done very badly. I love mtg, Hopefully the next installment is better executed.",0
15602,DCS World Steam Edition,2014.0,"DCS World is one of the few games I can really enjoy at any time of the day.. Its communities (eg hoggit) tend to be quite welcoming and friendly to all types of players, and that is huge plus.. DCS of course, has a variety of aircraft, mostly purchased ones for around $40, I would recommend picking up A-10C ASAP. Graphically, the game is quite nice (in the air), but ground textures are lacking in certain aspects, but EDGE should in theory fix this, along with some performance problems on older rigs. Overall, 10\10 gud gume 60 fps no crash",1
11710,WARMODE,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThe game basically sucks it has no real animations the game i would rate it a 2/10 there is no such thing in this game about spray patterns and yhere are too many hackers and no anti-chat system,0
12465,Digimon Masters Online,2016.0,"The english and grammar of the characters and npc's of this game is so painful I couldn't even..I just couldn't even...It makes the entire opening to the game too confusing.

1323,Creativerse,2017.0,"Building:Pros:The building stuff looks nice.It's easy to place blocks and rotate them exactly how you want them.Cons:The blocks require too many materials, even for basic blocks like windows or fences. It's not inherantly EXPENSIVE, just annoying.Combat:Pros:None that I can think of.Cons:Really janky.Enemies have no telergraph of their attacks at all.There is no way to block or mitigate damage, so you just have to constantly circle strafe and/or backpeddle to avoid taking damage.No sound or flash effect to notify you when you've connected a strike.Monster spawns are entirely based on light, with not even a safe zone around the player, so if you are walking in a dark cave, monsters might spawn literally on top of you. (Or, y'know, an almost-fully-lit-up cave, keyword ALMOST)Crafting:Pros:It's cute and simple.Take a thing, shove it into a machine and it cuts it up, or cooks it up, and then you come back later and pick up your finished thing.Cons:Extremely ""gamey"" recipies. A level 4 diamond digging glove takes diamonds (OK!), pristine feral pig skins (???), ice cubes (?????) and some other stuff. Why? Because those are all ""tier 4"" materials! Many other items have similarly stupid and pointless reagents needed, for gamey reasons!Too much stuff, too little inventory to manage it all.Exploration:Pros:The built-in map is a nice touch.Teleporters are easy enough to make, and there is a player waypoint ""touchstone"" which you are given for free, that functions essentially as a spawn point and teleport locale.Caves are large and vast. It was not often that I explored a cave in it's entirety.Cons:Not much to explore? The surface had perhaps 4 or 5 biomes total. Grassland, forest, canyon, snow, and.... Maybe one another? Maybe there were more, I don't know, I never found them. I explored quite a bit on the surface for a good 2 or 3 hours, and I just found these same 4 repeating over and over.The caves weren't much better, since it was entirely 100% layer-based. Between 0 and -25? surface caves.-25 to -50? Stalactite caves.-50 to -75? Lava caves.-75 to -100? Corrupted caves. Yawn.No structures, no nothing worth your time, unless you like looking at large and empty caves full of infinitely spawning monsters.-    Misc:Multiplayer was easy enough to do. I just started a world, and a friend joined me right away.Physics are kinda jenky. Sometimes monsters would 'pop' really high into the air and then fall down. Sometimes **I** would fly into the air when placing a block, killing me.Not really a fault, but I felt like the cash shop was too in-your-face too early. Before I had even gotten in-game the very first time, I was bombarded by the cash shop suggesting I buy stuff. Maybe hold off on that stuff till the 2nd launch, maybe?Overall, it was not that fun of a game, but at it's current price of Free, it was worth the cost.",1
19378,Fallout Shelter,2018.0,"After putting a decent amount of hours into fallout shelter I feel like it's about time I share my opinion on the game.To start off: I get that this game is free to play and all, but that doesn't stop it from being a shameless cash grab.Almost everything in this game requires you to pay up a sizeable amount of money, sure you can get somewhere without paying a single penny but this game was clearly designed around the pay to win route just like most mobile games.A lot of you might disagree with me on this but if waiting 5+ hours to complete a single quest is the sort of thing you like then be my guest.On top of that the game is hilariously unbalanced, Bethesda's idea of ""Difficulty"" in Fallout Shelter is to just spam a ♥♥♥♥ ton of enemies at once.The animations in this game are really unfinished as well, you could argue something like ""oh, but that's just the artistic style of the game!"" I don't think art style can be used as an excuse for not putting things on the right  L A Y E R S.I would say more about this game but that's basically all there is to this game,wait, click, repeat is all Fallout Shelter is when you look at it overall. Pay, click, repeat if you actually decide to spend money on this game for some reason.Overall:I can't recommend this game to anybody, I've seen worse but this game is still mobile gaming trash.",0
16951,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018.0,Why???? This game was probably the best FPS around in my opinion. I enjoyed it. Screamed at my monitor for dying. I loved it. But this game has completely nose dived into hell. FILLED WITH HACKERS.... and now instead of you know fixing that stuff they decide to jump on a trend and make a BATTLE ROYAL MODE??????!! Literally this game was amazing and then they destroyed it by jumping on something that changed the game completely. Its free now there goes my money. This game was great until they chose to not be original and jump on every trend out there. Thats what killed this game.,0
2427,Brawlhalla,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game used to be fun. Been playing for about a year or more, and really trusted the game would pick up, however I was quite wrong. The game is fun, if your playing against friends who are looking to have fun, from a competitive standpoint, this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. the devs release new weapons that completely powercreep the others, the gameplay hasnt changed in about 6 months when the community clearly sees a problems with certain aspects, the devs have no clue how to rebalance, and each ""update"" is so miniscule you could quit for months at a time and not see a difference.

15044,Dungeon Defenders II,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis game has jsut the right amount of excitement and breaks. I like how there always somethng to do even if yure not in a mission. 8/10 in my opinion very fun and a great timewaster.,1
3682,Fishing Planet,2015.0,Early Access Review I am trying to redownload the game.. It really looks like it was a very well thought out fishing sim! It loaded up for me a few times but the view seemed to jump around like my mouse drink to many energy drinks and took speed lol.. it seemed to do it as soon as i started to walk.. Maybe the reinstall will fix the problem.. I hope! I would very much recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good fishing game.. I will keep trying to fix the issue might upgrade my laptop alittle more just so it plays right.. Keep up the good work teem and ill be reading more on your progress in the future!!,1

The game is in early access... expect bugs and other minor glitches etc... With any game especially 1st person shooters expect hackers and wallhacks/ESP but honestly I rarely expereince this or see it unless you're diegosaurs or other big named streamer constantly getting streamed sniped by cheaters which 90% of the time get banned anyways... All the♥♥♥♥♥♥you read about this game collecting data or spying on you and being malware is a false positive... If you want a REAL company to worry about go YouTube/Google EA Games and look at how Origin is technically considered a whitelisted botnet... (whitelisted being it's not detected by anti viruses)People used Process Monitor to scan Origins behaviour and posted pictures of the program accessing files of their tax management program and their cell phone manager.obviously its scanning directories, but to look for games when the only ""games"" available on origin are from EA I find it hard to believe it would need to do such a deep recursive scan, but regardless I find it quite amusing that this program can pretty much hook into everything - read config files and who knows what else, it's♥♥♥♥♥♥like this on why I don't buy many games and the primary reason I refuse to install origin.",1

5561,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewNever before have I played a game where the matchmaking lobby is as exciting as the game itself!! I used to LOVE playing Asteroids as a kid - kudos to whoever thought to use it as a while-you-wait minigame (I sometimes find myself wishing the main game could wait a moment or two longer, which is just...wrong).The actual game itself is very well presented - as space-sims go this feels solid and generally balanced (though there are a few niggles, though it's only really an issue when your team choose their ships badly). The graphics are great on my 5 year old pc, and the devs are great at updating and bug-fixing. In fact, they seem to be listening VERY hard to the players - I sent in a ticket about an issue I had, then 3 days later the next fix has fixed it. Result!10/10 Lobby mini-game genius",1

The gameworld is like a beautiful girl you're getting to know and then at the magic moment she tells you you have to pay and that all of your frenemies already did, and did it on your gaming-chair. The constant reminder to buy in game purchases utterly destroyed any fun you were about to have with your friends too. The pretty game just told you that you probably weren't good enough to have fun without getting another job for more bling, and they should start paying too if they're gonna come over to HER place. Fun-less.So all in all I'd say this was about as disappointing as finding out that Santa wasn't real and that the dude mommy's been kissing all these years was just Jerry Seinfeld's pudgy, unemployed buddy Geoge.",0

290,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewYou can see that i spent one hour in the game, but i only gave this game the final shot before writing this review and unfortunately for this game, it took this long to get into single battle.I started to play it in late 2014 using robocraft launcher and managed to reach t7 in 3-4 days or so. Queue times were short and battles were fun, though the more i progressed the more cheaters i saw. It was the main problem those days. Developers tried to make authoritative server to solve the issue, but failed at that (because of obvious reason) and chosen EasyAntiCheat. Since it is client thing, it did not filter all the cheaters, and caused issues for many fair players because of how it is designed. After a while they decided to push another update, where they removed repair cost completely. Many players liked it, but mostly those who couldn't build a proper robot and those who often leave the battle in the middle of the game.In another huge update they changed the default game mode, that was a mistake once again, because new game mode was bugged and each round took a lot of time, making the players both play with half a team (because of explained above reason) and wait much longer between rounds.Of course there were some good updates and things too, like megabots and medics, but they cant overweight the bad ones.I stopped to play this game because it is very choppy. Seriously, i posted bug reports related to this several times almost a 8-9 months ago and it is still not fixed. Last time i even explained solution to this and that fact is ridiculous.Currently it is 3 months since unity 5.1 (including beta) is out. And it has authoritative server functionality built in. Guess what? They keep using EAC s*** instead of it. They created some vacancies on their site because they cant fix their game on their own. They expect that some one will come and fix everything for them!I don't believe they will ever fix their mess.",0

Also the gameplay is really fun, from flying your ship, or going on away missions. Another thing i really liked was all of the references to the shows ( TNG, Voyager, DS9, TOS, Enterprise and the movies) not to mention all of the actors who have voiced their characters in the game. (Michael Dorn, Robert Picardo, Tim Russ, Aron Eisenburg, Jeri Ryan, Walter Koenig, Leonard Nimoy, and others as well.

I've seen many friends who started out as total newbies and became very skilled.

6214,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewVery slick card game that sits in complexity between Hearthstone and Spellweaver. What I appreciate most about it is the refined interface that allows you to play quickly without waiting for animations to finish, and to have access to all info you need about the various card effects.The MTG-inspired battle mechanics are pretty good, as is the Instant system which allows you to react to enemy instants, stacking effects until one player stops replying - the only thing I sometimes wish for in Spellweaver, though that's definitely a tradeoff that will slow the game down when facing some players.The number of game modes available is also laudable, everything from gauntlet vs the AI to Ranked, to Draft.This said compared to Spellweaver or Hex I find browsing the card collection quite yawn-inducing. The effects on most cards are not very inspiring to say the least, they don't fire my imagination about potential synergies and combos like the former games do.In the end I'm recommending it as ""fast food"": it's easy to get into, they even give you pre-made decks regularly so you can just jump in without knowing a thing about deckbuilding, and you'll already be playing something more interesting than starter decks.",1
18272,Digimon Masters Online,2017.0,"Quick Review:This is an old (2009-ish) korean game (for those who play korean games, you know the grinding is real) , with micro-transactions everywhere. The game is really fun at the beginning, until you realise how much effort you'll have to put to get the most basic digimon, which will get slaughtered by mobs at the same level as it. If you're really craving a digimon online game, I'd recommend DigimonLinkz at the appstore nextdoor.Long Review:The game is free to play, but to have any chance at anything, you need to put in some cash since: - Inventory is limited (items and digimons); - Evolution requires cash shop items; About the cash shop: - Items seem cheaper now than they were before; - The cosmetic items and auras have a time limit; - LOOT BOXES (the eggs you buy have to be scanned, and you can get lvl 3 ( weaker than mobs same level ), lvl 4 and lvl 5 (way stronger than mobs same level); - The economy is more f*cked-up than Venezuela's, so you'll most likely resort to the cash shopAbout digimons: - Scanning and enhancing uses consumable items, and may fail, so you need to buy backups (so you buy an egg, the chips, and a backup). Failed attempts may destroy the item; - As said above, you need certain items to unlock evolutions and riding mode, all from the cash shop; - They have a good variety of digimons and digivolution lines.About gameplay and story: - Point and click game (they added WASD now with...different degrees of success); - Press F3 until you or your digimon dies; - Game has a stamina mechanic, to waste even more of your time; - Game has raids and dungeons, as most MMOs have; - Story more convoluted than Final Fantasy games;Random thoughts: - Devs don't seem to be too bothered about toxic players or botters; - They changed the initial maps, killing a bit of the nostalgia I had; - Not as laggy as it was last year; - Bots everywhere; - Can't merge with your old account, so bye-bye money you invested; - Devs are really trying to get new and old players in, so I wonder how longer it'll last; - No pvp (thank god, the korean one is awful); - ...I miss the game's 2009 launch...Please don't hate me.

9958,Paladins®,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is a great PvP game. Even for someone who usually shuns the genre. No pay to win model, diverse characters and nice ways to optimise your character via load outs (small skill boost deck).The amount of free content is impressive. A handful of heroes are available from the start and others can be unlocked via ingame gold which is earned by simply playing the game. The cash part is only for those that really like cosmetics or gamers with less patience.The gameplay is smooth, each character plays differently. Some heal or have great mobility via fly or teleport, others use shields and swallow loads of damage and some just apply raw damage. Winning depends on the team effort not the individual effort.The diversity of playgrounds is lacking, this game needs double the amount of arenas to stay interesting in the long run. And often you get kills while actually missing, so that needs optimisation. Cant say anything about ranked play, its locked until you got a whole bunch of champions on lvl 5. But frankly I dont care about ranked, the other game modes are fun to play.",1
10867,Path of Exile,2015.0,"-Devs, although they seem to be great and connect to the community, only really interface thorugh reddit and don't seem to address problems properly imo,-As mentioned in other reviews, this game turns into an oligopoly simulator where most players farm  to try adn get enough currency to play whatever build they want or simply flip currency to get there several times faster. The fact that there is entirely no deterministic farming means that trading is almost necessary for a lot of players given their playtime and as such multiplayer interactions are necessary.-Since multiplayer interaction is required, a mention to the fact that trading relies entirely on an external 3rd party website seems relevant. GGG makes no effort in fxing this issue and the in-game trade chat is an aberration of scammers and bots.-Balance changes are made around mostly the top players, i.e streamers and nolifers, meaning that the for the vast majority of the playerbase, many things are not possible at all, which is perfectly reasonable given the ARPG genre of the game. However, said balance changes are often nonsensical and utterly brainless: for instance blatantly overpowered uniques introduced to the game, most of existing uniques being useless garbage, nerfing the FOTM build every league. An extreme case that shows how out of touch the balance team at GGG is is the state of melee in the game: they don't even have the basic understanding that what makes melee skills relatively unviable, which is the mechanics. instead, they give a few % more modifier on the damage as if that will change anything. Ranged and spellcasters deal both more damage/have more aoe and are safer to play due to several reasons such as being closer to CI and also not having to be in melee range of mobs but they don't seem to understand thsi at all.-There is a lot of false diversity in this game. Given how difficult it is to produce a truly original build that really works, it is basically recommended to follow some build guide. When you consider all these build guides, they all share may similarities within given archetyoes, CWDT IC, same skill tree give or take a few nodes with different active skill gems: even the support gems are usually  the same, especially for melee skills. Whilst many active skill gems exist, many of them either have the same mechanics or are simply not used.-Crafting is also equally falsely diverse (not considering the new essence league which is not part of the core game) givem that it consists of spamming orbs of fusings to get a 6-link or spamming chaos with the occasional exalt slam. -The fact that the game is still treated as a public beta and bugs, although they might be fixed reasonably quickly, are not accounted for in terms of previosu playerHC lost characters worries me given that the game has existed for such a long period of time. In addition, almost every recent league launch has been horrendous and problem-ridden, yet it is still described by the GGG team as ""having gone well"" with no mention at all of the huge problems that happened, especially given the competitive nature of the game and the very staggered starts that different people encountered on the ladder to 100.-Many problems still exist in the game despite general engine improvements, e.g. lag from rain and ground effects, which have persisted since their introduction, and the game has only just come relatively close to other games of similar fame in terms of performance.In conclusion, I would not recommend this game given how slow the early game is for new players and how dire the current state of the game is.Addendum: After the passing of a few more ""leagues"", repeated bad design and balance issues and a failulre to understand at it's basis what a game of this genre is meant to achieve, probably due to the void of other games in the arpg genre, I have reached the point where I no longer expect anything from Grinding Gear Games: the leagues become sloppier and sloppier with little to no end game content to even look forward to.There is no real skills rebalance and the devs obviously don't even playtest their own content for balance: this is evident from their delegation of the balancing to the reddit community, especially notable popular streamers of the game, and it is really unforgiveable for a company of their size to be so inept at anything except PR and occasionally art.The release of multiple ""loot boxes"" for visual microtransactions is visibly becoming worse and worse, with the latest complete armour set requiring on average $210 with huge variance due to dupilcates. I would not recommend anyone purchase anything with money in this game unless they agree with most of GGG's design philosophies.",0

14171,Brawlhalla,2017.0,"When I first reviewed this game, I was way too critical about it. I think I need a better explaination for my feelings.As a strictly Rivals of Aether fan, I feel brawlhalla is very watered down. I feel like there is only 10 ish real characters in this game due to all weapons having the exact same moveset (like one sword character will have the same moves [aside from sigs]), and because of that I feel zero connection to any characters. I think the artstyle is lazy having all the characters have the same exact body template and its weird that everyone is as light as paper, even the rock character is light as a feather.I also don't like how most of the cast is locked behind a paywall but I can forgive that due to the game being free.I don't like competitive  play for this game, its just a bunch of ledge camping and it feels really boring; however I could see why some brawlhalla fans would like it. So now you might ask, why would I give brawlhalla a thumbs up if I have so many complaints?A. Because its a partygame at heart and its great at being oneB. It's freeC.

19405,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018.0,"Deathmatch:- 2 teams (ct and t). aim is to run around and try get as many kills as you can.- different point values are awarded depending on the weapon used when you get a kill.- which ever player gets the most points will win the match for there whole team.- instant infinite respawn on death.- infinite ammo (but still have to reload).Competitive:- 2 teams (ct and t), aim is to complete an objective to win the round. which ever team is first to win 16 rounds wins the match. games can also end in a draw if both teams manage to get 15.- objectives, a round can be won by any of the following: 1. killing the whole enemy team (before the bomb is planted)2. killing the whole enemy team (before a hostage is rescued)3. defusing a planted bomb (ct win)4. bomb explodes (t win)5. by rescuing a hostage (ct win)- all players have a skill group ranging from unranked (lowest) to global elite (highest). players of a similar skill are placed together.- you cant leave the match, if you do you will get banned.Casual:- same as comp but any one can play with anyone else regardless of skill.- no ranking system- larger teams then comp.- leave or join match at any pointWar games:- a collection of game modes based off of comp or deathmatch but with diffrent objectives (e.g. win round by getting kill with knife in arms race) and different conditions (e.g. low gravity in flying scout's man).- the war games are as follows: arms race, demolition, and flying scoutsman.Battle Royale:- similar concept to PUBG or Fortnite. parachute in, large map, search around for weapons and loot.  to win, objective is to be last player alive.- servers are much smaller with only 16 players, which differs compared to the 100 players of other battle royale games like Fortnite.My opinion on new free to play update:why would any hacker waste money on buying csgo when they can play it for free?remember that non prime (free to play) and prime (paid users) dont mix.so by making the game f2p: it separates legitimate users (people who are willing to pay money for the game), with hackers (people would rather save them selves a bit of money and play the free version, as there is no need for them to waste money getting prime).so yes there will be a lot more hackers in free version, but you won't have to deal with them if you yourself are prime.in my opinion this is one of the best moves valve could of made. and i understand there thinking as to why they did it.",1

19622,Robocraft,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter reading some of the negative comments, I must say it's not as bad as they paint it...The game's about building vehicles like they were lego's and putting guns on them and pin your creation against other peoples creations. It's fun! Satisfaction comes from seeing your creation bust up the creation of other people as you shoot them. At the end of the match, you return to your mothership to make repairs and/or changes to your ship before the next match. Repair costs increase the higher level you are, but you usually earn more than what you loose in repairs. At higher tiers it does start digging into your pockets, but it creates an environment where careful strategy against the enemy becomes the main focus, and not some rambo crazy kamikaze attack because you'll literally end up paying for mistakes with credits you can use to otherwise upgrade your ship.Sure, there are ""premium"" users, but that's not a huge deal... all they get are blocks that you can also get with some game-time. They still have to level up to use enough of them because of the ""CPU"" Point system, so it's not exactly Pay2Win (Because, I must emphasize that you can get what they can the more you play)My favorite part about this game is the physics engine. You can't just make any vehicle work out, so it's funny seeing people at spawn flip over onto their backs or flying ships going haywire because they can't get good weight distribution. Overall, it's a great game to pick up, play for a bit and then do something else. You won't regret it.Oh, did I mention it's a free download? ... yeah ;)Review Update#12/10/2015The game just keeps getting better and betterRepair costs are gone and new parts just keep flowing in!Optimizations are fantastic and with each Update comes a fresh breath of air that spices things up!",1

Because since the Gun Mettle and Tough Break updates came out, ALL the stock weapons have atleast 1 reskin (apart from a few things like the sapper and PDA's).

It helps even the new players get what they want and need and for me after being Killed 3 times by two diff people i've decided to be a hunter someone who takes the lives of those to pillage and hunt / live off of what others find but in this you can't just let anyone see you.

However, it seems with every update the game just seems to get worse. It wasn’t perfect of course (what is?) but steadily, with each and every update, more features are removed, more fun sucked out of the game.For everything positive that was added, two features would be removed and some new crap would be added. Freejam caught lightning in a bottle then squandered it.They don’t care about their player base (check the steamcharts if you don’t believe me) tossing everything aside in there rush to their “vision”, a MOBA, E-sport knock off, that copies (badly) features from other, far more popular games that will never be successfully added to the wonderful game they already had. All priority is given to attracting new players with no regard to keeping the actual players that already loved the game (something for new players to keep in mind, you’ll be next to be thrown under the bus).To borrow an old phrase, “I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed”",0

12586,War Thunder,2016.0,"The greed of these devs has always been impressive. They do everything they can to push you to buying premium time and gold. At tier 4 and beyond the grind ramps up to a ridiculous level, but with premium you get double exp. Also silver is damn slow to get, but of course premium time gives you double silver too.And worse than just researching new vehicles, when you buy a new tank or ship you have to research fire extinquishers and repair kits for them, and the speed at which you do that also slows down at higher tiers. So once you get that shiny new vehicle all it takes is one touch to damage your weapon or engine or start a fire and there is nothing you can do about it unless you manage to reach your base or a cap point and live long enough to repair there, so most of the time the only option is to wait for death or suicide, because you will die anyway trying to reach a repair point.With ground forces specifically, there's the added grind to unlock new ammo types as well. Many tanks start out with an ammo type that is basically useless for what they will be going up against, and since you are unable to cause much damage it slows the grind down even more.But of course, if you buy gold you can instantly purchase these items and bypass the research time to skip the struggle!Got a new american tank destroyer and after about a dozen matches i still don't even have the repair kit because as soon as i see an enemy my inferior ammo bounces off them and when they return fire they can hit any part of my tank to put it out for the match instantly.Coming back to the game, I wanted to try out this new PvE tank mode, thinking it would be a good place to grind out repair kits and extinguishers for my tanks at least. The problem is that it's a wave assault purposely made to get your vehicles destroyed as many times as possible. And to respawn you need to pay silver... so it will just bleed you dry if you want to play it without premium.On top of this, the matchmaking and balance is total♥♥♥♥♥♥ A 1.0 rating difference between vehicles can be insane, and when you are bottom rating in a match it's a massive handicap. In air battle enemies will be faster, more durable, and can have 2-3 times the weaponry. In ground battles, anything focused on armor will be nearly invulnerable. In naval battles, you will get shredded by a single enemy shot.",0

Really boring and no strategic at all.- Super random effects everywhere in prophecies, abilities, spells. Gambling at its best form.- No counter tactics.- No interaction in your opponents turn.- No color/attribute theme and special character. They are all a big mixed salad.

And if you buy something with money like new guns and such you can keep them indefinitely except the consumables. And just buy the types of guns to suit your hunting style and your fine. Also the ammo replenish after hunts so you only need a case or two. Because the yearly subscription fee is not that big and you get loads of stuff with it I think it is actually pretty fair.

1571,War Thunder,2015.0,"TL;DR great game destroyed by bad devs.Would I reccomend this game a year back? Yes. My best friend introduced me to it and I got hooked, we played for HOURS just pwning people in RAF planes.  It was brilliant, with wonderfully detailed models (still applies now tbh) and varied gameplay with a challenging yet entertaining game that was just fun to play.Then slowly but surely they made dumber and dumber decisions, like casualising tank gameplay (Even on sim mode!) Having imbalanced and unrealistic gameplay (Stalinwood and RAF Planes are best, everyone else suffers) making the game a grindfest and making planes too expensive (you have to grind 'silver lions' to repair planes after battle, if you run out you have to grind starter biplanes) My friend gave up about halfway through saying 'this game is just another P2W 'free' grindfest.' He's right, the game isn't as bad as others (No names), but he's still right.And then the team started making outright moronic changes to the game, the dealbreaker for me was when they started to make flags and certain decals in the game cost real life money, apparently because Ukrainians were using them to bully those poor poor Rooshan soldiers who play this game, after takings ze vacations in Ukrop...Comrade Pootings was made of the sad there, comrades. Politics aside, it's just a cash grab. A dirty filthy cash grab. If they really cared, they'd ban Ukrainian IP's or just removed the flags all together.It was kinda like my ex GF, she started off interesting, fun and she was pretty too, but then she started to get fat, started chatting behind my back and asking for more and more gifts, I hoped both would eventually go back to the good times, but I knew it wouldn't happen. I knew it had to be broken off. So I unsubscribed from the subreddit, deleted it from the library, broke up with Gaijiin by text and killed and hid my computer under the patio when they started to talk backBasically, the developers suffered Hanlon's Razor (never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance). In other words, they aren't EA, but they did make some dtupid decisions that pretty much ruined the game. so I'm writing this review, then I'm uninstalling. Sorry  Gaijiin, you dun goof'd.

It's not the guns that will make a difference. Just upgrade your implants or armour or if you go combat medic like I do then upgrade your healer.

I'm very specific about what I enjoy in aRPG's, but this definitely delivers on all the fronts that I've come to like. The maps are repetitive but random (this is a good thing) and there is an obscene amount of loot to find. The currency system is different, but better (I remember vividly how useless gold was in D2 - no more). The passive tree isn't very intuitive (if you want a competitive character, that is), but it does offer a lot of potential for theorycrafting if that is what you enjoy. As far as I can tell the classic aRPG class niches have all been nicely filled. If you don't feel like theorycrafting, there's an active forum community (official forums, obviously - not the steam ones) that probably has a guide for the thing that you want to play somewhere.

On steam I only got 602hrs since typing this but that doesnt include playing this game not through steam for over a year when I was the most active playing.  My current opinion though is I have been slowly moving away from this game because its a struggle to play anything that uses solid AP rounds as spalling is very lacking making tanks with APHE more effective.  Then theres the screwed up BR system as where tanks face others that will struggle alot against which will cause trouble especially for players that havent gotten the stronger tanks where as I have rank 5 tanks in every nation except brit.  I sometimes go back to play lower tier tanks for fun and always seem to get upranked all the time which makes it extremely hard but can handle it since I know almost all of the tanks weaknesses and such.  But this for new players will cause people to stop playing much sooner.  Currently the game needs alot of work especially in BR, DM, spalling, and much more before the game is perfect.  Personnaly I say they should stop adding new tanks for now tell they fix alot of the small issues then add more once the problems are fixed as everytime they add a new tank more problems form then ones that are fixed causing a bigger hole dragging this game down.Currently I dont know if I can recommend this game due to all the problems but its still a blast to play here and there but I no longer put 7+hrs a day anymore in this game because of the issues it has.  Ill be putting no for recommendation for now but dont let that distract you as the game is worth a try but I just cant recommend it at the moment with the way the game is right now.",0

18162,Crush Crush,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access Review TL;DR:  Game is a fun daily check in for your virtual waifus where you pretty much make girls fall in love with you by meeting their requirements to advance your realationship with them.Pretty simple game really, you leave your character either working or leveling up his/her traits for your waifus. I enjoy it for how simple it is and easy to pick up. I would recommend this game for anyone who is bored and needs something to try out but cant commit too much time into. The pros and cons are as follows:Pros:-Decent Art, it isn't perfect but still does the game some good-Appealing characters (to me that is, not everyone may agree).-Reset for longer play-Traits/Hearts/Money can be generated while offline. -Save files-Simple UICons: -Music can get repetitive...this is easily fixed by muting it and playing your own. -Paying gems for saves, hell no. At least the progress is still there though when you check back though.-Item prerequisites are kinda crazy, although i can see why since making money isn't too hard after a few resets and days of being offline. -Microtransactions being boosters and time skips, honestly it doesn't surprise me these exist but I am patient enough to wait a few days rather than pay for a skip. In a nutshell, I give this game a 6/10. It isn't amazing but it is still charming enough for myself to want to check in on it and play it for a little.  ",1
8344,Star Trek Online,2015.0," To boldly go where no series has gone before! Star Trek Online has come a long way from the 49.99 shelf price I picked it up at. From beaming down to that alien world of your favorite Star Trek episode, to fighting the Borg across the sector. Each piece culminates into a game anyone who enjoys Sci-fi can love. Trekkies of course get the opportunity to visit each of those scenes they loved most in Star Trek.The current iteration of Star Trek Online is quite simply put, 'Marvelous' and only getting better with the addition of the Delta Quadrant. PVE is the main focus, but PVP is possible in specified battle zones. Surprisingly, and a wonderful touch in my opinion—has been the growing addition of Voice Actors for a number of main quests, and most importantly, voice acting by actual Star Trek actors, come to replay their digital roles. Some of STO’s original voice acting flops, but they have gotten very good at putting the proper emotion behind their voice actor’s character. Each new addition is far better than the last. More than anything else, in this game…the story is perhaps the cherry on top. Wrapping the player into a universe that is similar, and yet so very different from the shows we used to watch. I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Science Fiction of any kind, just wants to kill things in space ships, or loves a good story. Oh, and of course if you are a trekkie, why aren’t you playing already? ",1

10138,War Thunder,2016.0,"With my hours in this I beleive I can give a credible opinion on this game. I reccomend this game if you're planning on playing this game every once in a while, as with this games terrible grind system you won't be getting too far down the tech trees. I play both Tanks and Aircraft and it seems the balance goes down the drain the further you get and the matches get less and less enjoyable. Planes are great, although the Russian aircraft get really annoying as a bit less than half the players i it seems bring them into battle. I love American tech and Vehicles so I primary them, and then the Germans for both game modes and it from what I experience everything in the American lineup isn't as good as the others it's put up against - this is mostly directed for ground forces. A massive chunk of the earlier tree is made up of the M4 Sherman type tanks and its great at first but when you use the same gun for 5 tanks down the same tree facing tigers and panthers and broken T34 it becomes incredibly stale. Now that I have 2 6.0 tanks going into battle is now a complete waste of time, I usually when I play ground forces get 4-5 kills per match but now i'm getting less than 300 RP and barely a single assist. My advice is to either 1: pay for premium/golden eagles to boost your way out of the terrible 5.7+ mess of a matchmaking or quit and play another of the factions until you hit that point. It, after hundreds of hours of work is incredibly dissappointing.",0

1760,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has been in beta for over 3 years. Recently they just did a patch that made everyone's previous grind worth nothing, and put a paywall up to play the generals portion of the game. So they made the generals portion of the game unaccessable to the players, and the FPS portion of the game is ABSOLUTELY HORENDOUS. There are 6 FPS maps. 6. In 3 years of open beta, they have managed to design 6 extremely buggy maps. The equipment's pretty imbalanced towards the allies. They actually have Shermans beating up Panzer IVs. The vehicles aren't even upgradable. There's planes but each side has 1 plane and they're really glitchy.You're better off anywhere else for an FPS game, and you're better off anywhere else for strategy game. It was kinda cool before the last patch because at least the common player could play in the strategy game and then go and influence the battle in FPS, but now you can't play the strategy game and the FPS has always sucked, so just playing this for the FPS is a dumb idea.",0

1526,Dota 2,2014.0,"Dota 2 is a multiplayer game (though you can play against bots). There are two teams of five players - the Radiant, and the Dire. Each player picks from a list of many characters, each with a different set of abilities. The two teams start on opposing sides of the map (there's only one map in the game). Each team has a base area, in which resides an ""Ancient"". From each base, creeps - these autonomous NPC creatures - spawn periodically in waves, and start a journey toward's the other teams base. Towers are scattered around the map that will automatically fire on any enemy unit.The goal for each team is to destroy the other team's Ancient, while defending their own. Hence: Defense of the Ancients.Sounds simple - but there's a lot more to it than this. Imagine the game starts and both teams just stay in their own base. Creeps from both teams will wander out from one base and head to the other, meeting somewhere in the middle of the map, where they will fight (again, they do this automatically without any player input). The creeps are evenly matched so typically they will both wipe each other out. The next wave of creeps will clean up anything left over - or they'll reach a tower, and get smashed by it - and the cycle will continue.Basically, nothing will happen - the game will not end, because the creeps can't get anywhere. Now imagine just one player from one of the teams goes out with his creeps. He can attack the enemy creeps, and support his own creeps as they make their way across the map, knocking down towers along the way. Eventually, he'll get to the enemy Ancient, and be able to destroy it. But if just one enemy player comes out to meet him, the teams will be more evenly matched - and it comes down to a player versus player (PvP) scenario.The PvP is, of course, the heart of the game. It is of a high level of complexity - the learning curve is quite steep, making it challenging for noobs, which is one of the reasons why the community was famed for being full of what I will euphemistically call ""short tempered people"". One player who doesn't know what he is doing can easily bring down the whole team.The complexity comes from two main parts - first, the sheer number of selectable characters in the game. At the time of writing, there are 102 characters - with more added periodically as the game is updated. Each character has four different abilities (sometimes more) that are active (requiring the user to press something to make them go) or passive (they just operate automatically). The abilities are character-specific, though there are common elements between them. Some of the abilities require chaining to use them effectively, and each ability is leveled individually as your character earns experience.After you've done the maths and figured out how many different abilities there are between all the characters - and thought about how long it would take to become familiar with even a small handful of them - consider that in addition to that, there are over 120 different items that you can equip your character with. Items can perform new actions or augment your existing ones (again, they are active or passive in nature).Oh yeah - each game takes a long time to finish - around 45 minutes is pretty common. You will never get away with saying ""I'll just have a quick game of Dota"" to your significant other - at least, not once they've put up with you playing it a few times.So - learning curve. Big one. Time investment (or sink, if you prefer). Big one. Especially when you're trying to play with other people and they're abusing you for not knowing what you're doing. But the real question is - is it worth it?I've clocked up almost 400 games (and there's still some characters I haven't played). I'm not turning pro any time soon, but have a reasonable handle on the fundamentals. My win rate is about 50%, which seems to be fairly normal. Losing is often traumatic, especially after you've lost a couple of long 45-60 minute games in a row, or you're saddled with random teammates in the matchmaking who are abusive idiots (or just bad).But the games that are good - they're really good. With so many combinations and different ways to exploit them, the level of satisfaction when you're playing with friends and manage to co-ordinate a five-person push on a tower, laying down that perfect combo that takes advantage of all your abilities, wiping out the other team.... well, that's what keeps me coming back for more.Not only that, but once you've invested a bunch of time and gotten over some initial learning humps, it's genuinely fun exploring the different characters and item combinations. There are always new builds to try and new items to buy. I've gone through several ""favourite characters"", depending on which new ones I've played recently and how well they worked out with my natural play style and with my teammates. Even after around 400 hours of gametime, I still have more to explore.I do, however, only really enjoy playing the game with my friends. I've tried a few games ""solo"", just picking up teammates using the matchmaking service, and I find this massively less fun. It's less engaging because I typically don't like to communicate with randoms via voice, and your chances of picking up toxic players are increased. I've had good games with randoms, but generally don't bother playing unless my mates are online.As with all reviews, this one attempts to help answer the question: ""should I buy this game?"". Well, good news - Dota 2 is free. It has just come out of a long invite-only beta period, so your actual financial investment in whether or not you should get into the game is zero. But there are two big questions you need to ask yourself:1. Can I justify the amount of time I need to get decent at this game before I start enjoying it?Make no mistake, the learning process for this game is An Ordeal. If you're prepared to spend many hours reading guides and playing with bots until you can beat them on a reasonable difficulty - maybe 10 games? - then that's a good start. If you've got mates that are happy to babysit you then that's good - but note that most of them will not want to do this because it almost certainly means they'll be losing (a lot) while you're still struggling with the basics.The best way to approach it is to read some guides - I recommend Welcome to Dota, You Suck - and play with bots until you can beat them on Hard, reliably, with one character. Then find some friends who are happy to play with you knowing your noob status, and play some games online with them. The more friends the better; if you're matchmaking with randoms they will probably be less tolerant.2. Why is it free? I seriously can play this without paying anything?Dota 2 is built on the ""freemium"" model. It's free to play, and you can purchase in-game items for money. By giving the game away, Valve hope to make more money selling in-game items than if they'd charged for the game. This is an increasing trend - so get used to seeing it more, especially for games with a strong network effect (i.e., anything with multiplayer).The things you can buy for Dota 2 are basically adornments for the characters. For example, you can outfit them with new armour, or a new sword, or some new spell effects, that are different from the stock-standard one that they come with. You can get some of these for free - they'll randomly drop at the end of games - but the good ones for your preferred characters you'll have to shell out for.It's very important to note that these items are purely decorative and have no impact on the gameplay at all. You can't pay money for a new sword that does more damage - it just looks different. This is critical and stops the game from becoming a silly pay-to-win thing. If you're a content creator, you can also create your own stuff and sell it in the store (splitting revenue with Valve). ",1

9742,Neverwinter,2014.0,"My vote for the ""Great Because I Paid"" award. ;)This should win because you literally aren't sh*t if you've never bought stuff in the game.

Overall, this game is a lot of fun in the early stages. But when you become a reasonably high level, you can't compete with people with some better items (which you need to buy with money or trade a lot of stuff to get that much AD).

2381,Infestation: The New Z,2017.0,"This game is actually one of the worst things i've ever played, its got it all ladies and gentlemen, huge empty maps, pay to win microtransactions, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay and glitches, no body in the development team cared about this game, they just want to make money",0
12107,Bless Online,2018.0,Maybe this game gets fun later on. Right now it's just people autorunning quest to quest. At one stage I was running the game at 1FPS and I tell you what the game isn't any more engaging as a slide show.,0
5719,Heroes & Generals,,"game used to be amazing. it now sucks, used to be one of my favorit games, now im unistaling it. tanks used to be HP based, it wasn't perfect but it made sence. now tanks are awfull with a modual system that dosent work. planes are busted too, the P-38 beats all the other heavy fighters easily. the Me Bf 109 beats the mid fighters, and the recon planes all suck so bad that they're equil. infantry sucks because russians have the worst guns / equipment of the three nations. germany has the most accurit, damaging, and advanced weapons of the three. also when the game first came out most people chose the germans and grinded all the things they could and are Over powered now. last thing that is broken in the game that im going to mention, Curency. money is extremly hard to get you get 2000 cash from a decent game, and the first gun you can get costs 25000, plus the xp you have to get first. better guns cost the same as some tanks, around 250000. I even bought some gold but that $20 i spent will never get me to like this game again. either fix the game or get rid of it. because right now it's awful. I'm unistalling this game now so if you want my advice dont waste the time or space on your computer, just don't get it. my rating of the game: 1/10",0
3752,Fishing Planet,2015.0,Early Access ReviewOne of the best fishing sims out there currently very addictive and alot of fun and rewarding at the same time! I highly recommend this game if you enjoy fishing real life at all because this game is really realistic and is a good sim that mimics real life fishing! highly recommend!10/10,1
19447,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,Early Access ReviewIts a poor mans red orchestra thats less user friendly and you have to rank up to play the real matches drive vehicles or get a gun that shoots straight for every faction!!! (US germany USSR) granted it is early access so they could fix the confusing menus,0
10,School of Dragons,2015.0,"The game's concept is amazing for kids and adults who are fans of the HTTYD movies. However, strip that fact away and you're left with a game that is buggy beyond enjoyability and is very limited in the free to play model. Multiple quests are bugged and unable to be completed, the game crashes to the desktop, features are bugged and force you to reload the game to be able to resume play.  My daughter enjoys flying on her dragon, but outside of that I am extremely disappointed.",0
466,WARMODE,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's early access but the graphics are dingy, you have tons of hackers, lag, absolute crap for weapon balance.Insanely low recoil/spread - even COD has more.Combat feels shallow and uninspired....Needs a ton of work to even be 'fun' - especially to be matched with people who actually speak English or live anywhere near to the states.Overall rating 3.5/10 - Would NOT recommend.",0
6835,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Great TCG. ....well... no, not really.Completely unbalanced game. The first player that plays a premium card wins the game. (Except you are lucky enough to kill the card in exactly that turn)",0
361,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIn my brief (comparatively) experience with this game I have thuroughly enjoyed it. This has been stated many times but Eternal gives many advantages to F2p's that most CCGs do not. the game positively showers the player with gold constantly, giving out card packs filled with goodies at the slightest reason. You just won your first game of the day? Here's a pack! You just won three games in a row? Here's another pack! you get the point. Now, that being said the game does have flaws. I.E the power system, if you've played magic you understand the inherrent flaws that come with this system. Overall I don't have enough beef with anything here to justify a negative review, the deckbuilding is creative, though the power system is a tad restrictive for my tastes. and there are enough people playing that it usually doesn't take that long to find a match.8/10, you should at least give it a try!",1
559,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016.0,"If you join a pub server and scroll through the players you'll probably find at least one more or less blatant waller, and you can rest assured VAC isn't going to detect their tutorial copy paste cheats any time soon. You know it's bad when there's an actual business around providing a 3rd party matchmaking system where people don't cheat, and there's more than one competing platform. Gun balance is what it is, it comes and goes with Valves seemingly random patches. Some changes the community agrees with, some it doesn't, not like the community can always even agree with itself. Pistols are stronger than I'd like, certainly stronger than in previous titles. Acceleration and player speed are quite quick, which sometimes leads to frustrating experiences with getting dicked on by a strafe spamming pistol player.Speaking of frustrating experiences, it's hard to blame Valve for the playerbase, but still I wish there was something to be done about it. Mostly matchmaking gives you cool teammates, but sometimes you face a tirade of rage and abuse without any recourse. I'm not sure the reports actually do anything.You could say there's a lot of customizability what with the cosmetics, skins and sprays and such. It's just that you used to be able to download them from fpsbanana but Valve has figured out a way to turn that into a revenue stream. Good for them, money sink for others. Granted, you don't need cosmetics but I think it's safe to say most like to have a few. I have mixed feelings.At it's core CS:GO is a solid competitive team FPS with a lot of gameplay depth, good map pool, active playerbase and lots to learn and room to improve yourself. There's just many little pitfalls. I think a lot of people will end up spending more time on this game than they initially expected. I don't know if I'd recommend it. You get really into it and then it just becomes too frustrating.",0
7937,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2014.0,"Dont get it, back around mines of moria expansion, this game could be up to WoW standards and maybe any better. Now........ The creaters of runscape have more intelligance than the staff here. You ask for help, they will not respond.",0

I love this game...I hate this game, it made me hate everything and yet i kept coming back for more.... Yes Monkey king is a little Broken, as all new heroes are....But this change is just more than i care to take with the time i sunk into this game. So the good- Still looking?The not so good- The new map, blows mostly, too much low ground- The UI is terrible (Too Small)- The hero name above the portrait is cheap and looks unfinished- The shop is terrible- Checking enemy items is terrible- The Skill tree is terrible, pick 3/4 cores and win game by default because lvl25=23, get midas and pick XP bonus. GG EZ. - The skills in the skill tree are terrible, let's give heroes free lifesteal, triple silence, triple sniper shot...Cool...but not what those heroes are to me.- Level 25 CM? With blink, drums, hex, and aghs 40 min game? NO PROBLEM- And since all heroes changes etc. are based around the above♥♥♥♥♥♥skill tree, that just means EVERYTHING is terrible.- Please rename game either STORM : Heroes of the League of Dota from Newerth.... OR Level 25 Rush Simulator.- The Arcade style VS thing....is just....nasty.- HEAPS more clowns than usual, Congrats your patch cleaned the bottom of the barrel- The Stats tab being gone and not being levelable is terrible.- Wanna know how much int your OD has vs enemy to calculate damage? Goodluck if you don't know the game and heroes inside out,,,,but we making it noob friendly don't worry.- The damage, MS and armour tab is just♥♥♥♥♥♥ - Let's add a backpack to make it less confusing, its worse than ever....I'd rather have it drop on the ground thanks.- The Pre Planning is nifty, but should be kept for captain's mode, i want to have fun, and not reason with 4 random idiots why not having a courier is a bad idea before the game even starts- This game no longer feels like dota....having played HON, HOTS and League, it feels like none of them, but like a bastard child spawned of 4 way incest. THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN- The performance issues are terrible- The servers are somehow worse than ever- I feel let down having downloaded 6.6GB of this♥♥♥♥♥♥br>I have a old image on external which i will never update to keep the memory of the game you guys ruined. If your intent is to force people to play this mess, with no regards for year long fans, give us a mod so we can search for games of a version of our choosing. OR SOMEONE MAKE A MOD PLEASE.While i have friends that have found this to be great, some have complained that the above appears to be more noticeable when playing solo. Maybe with 4 Friends this can still be great given the right circumstance.I accept many will disagree with all of this, but reviews are what our perceptions are on said things, and this is just mine.

7748,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is like playing a dude that is drunk and he got on pans and bags on his arms. When you go to try to aim its all slow and you have no control. 123FPS and it plays like 1.23 fps. That will be a no for me dawg.,0
240,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Let me begin by saying that I'm a big fan of the genre. I'm a huge sucker for 2-d mmos. Ragnarok, runescape, maplestory, elsword, etc. They give me a sense of control I could never experience in a 3d game.Is the game fun? Eh.It's a game that makes me want to keep playing. There's tons of things you can optimize: hats, stats, gear, gems, skills, class choices, collections, achievements, exploration, crafting, secrets, movement tricks, I could go on and on. It's a game that's simple on the surface but extremely deep. You will spend hours playing this game without being in front of a computer. ProsAt it's core, it's all about the grind. Hate it our love it, you will eventually have to buckle down and do it. I have no problem with this, but others might. Personally, I think the game does a good job of making the grind more enjoyable. A variety of monsters have rare, valuable loot that make you feel like it was all worth it. Crafting requires recipes which are dropped by monsters. Then collecting the items needed to craft that item is like completing a quest and getting a reward. Craft enough to fill out your journal and you can get adventurer points and experience. Gameplay is highly skill based, requiring both knowledge and a bit of finesse. The game is optimized for keyboard controls, so your skillshots can only be aimed in 8 directions. There are still cursor target skills that are better for mouse players, yet still comfortable for keyboard. Also supports gamepads.MehsSome may feel that the game feels too hand-holdy, but that's common for theme park mmos. There's also a very high level cap of 280 that is expected to grow to 600 in the far future. If you're in a rush to hit cap, it will take you at least a month. Some p2w features like putting random stats on hats that would normally all have none. All the hats and the premium membership can be purchased using in-game currency from the marketplace, negating the p2w aspect. Add-ons made by users are also available, improving the quality of life of the game.ConsBugs are present, just like in every other game you're played. Translations are done by volunteers so there are some mistakes in the text that may bother grammar nazis. Bots are somewhat common like every other f2p mmo, but you can block them with an add-on. Some classes are horribly balanced, but that may change as new ones get added. Lag and poor netcode are the biggest offenders. You don't need a good connection to play, but you will be heavily disadvantaged.Personally, I love this game to bits. Though many of its positive features are personal likes, those who aren't fans of the genre will have a hard time enjoying this game.",1
4279,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFull disclosure I am a founder having picked up the top version of this game immediately at launch.  My time played is greatly inflated due to the amount of time spent on que screens.  I can not reccomend this product in good conscience, there are some redeeming factors but the bad simply outweighs the good at this point. Steer clear of this game for the forseable future.",0

3328,War Thunder,2018.0,"After installing this game to try it, it later installed a autoupater piece of software that that ran at startup (Gaijin.net). The uninstall of Warthunder did not remove it so I had to research it and do it manually (the auto-updater does not register properly with Windows to be removed.) The Gaijin.net updater essentially acted as malware would and it was very unprofessional for the developers to release it in this form, nor explicitly ask permision for the additional software install after the original install.",0

9469,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2014.0,"Absolutely a fantastic game after re-vamp of the classes and polishing the world. This game has unrivalled atmosfear!I am truly impressed by this game, and for the very first time since it's release I have high hopes of raching end level tus experiencing my favourite fantasy city when they release it in an expansion: Minas Tirith!I always met the wall around level 30 before revamp; levels got slow, and the ""induction"" time, which are much less noticeable now, became unbearing.This game is now a strong 8/10; would be a dead-sure 10/10 if there was so that we could create a character on the ""dark side"" and level it up in it's own zones; PVMP doe's not really stir my interest in the way game is, but as a PvE game it surely is a gem.",1

12557,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewA bad magic clone full of all the same mistakes made by its antiquated predecessor: Mana Flood/Screw. Mid game dead draws due to useless excess mana cards in order to try and prevent the aforementioned. Its gorgeous to look at. But it plays exactly like the game they cloned to make it. And with the devs deviding their time between this and the equally clunky Hearthstone cash-in called Elder Scrolls Legends, neither game gets updates nearly quickly or reliably enough, and neither game has anything truly unique to offer.",0

It's just about grinding, you have to play a lot to get powerful, other than that everything is on sale, you don't have a knife or secondary gun, your gun doesn't have sight you have to pay 75,000 for 2times scope sight (if you wanna know how much is this, the US M3 submachingun price is 50,000 still cheaper than the scope). I got bored that everything needs buying even your ammunation.",0
705,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2014.0,"This is a great game (even the comments are fun to read, especially Linkno1's). Personally, and this is probably just me... I think everyone should learn about guns, that way they wouldn't be such p*ssies when it came to owning and handling one. This game is a great first step in LEARNING about guns. Practice, of coarse, is a whole different story. My Wife and I both enjoy this game, because it's like a puzzle game combined with the game of Memory, combined with things that can kill and maim. What's not to like? And, for the record, my Wife didn't want guns in the house until I took her to the shooting range. Now she thinks she's Rambo. It's quite sexy (now, if I can just get her to wear a bikini when we go...). The only down-side is that when we argue, she swears she's gonna go ""Tarantino on my♥♥♥♥♥quot;. I usually have to remind her that he often uses Mexican stand-off's in his films, which means that she wouldn't make it out alive either. Her response is ""I don't care! I didn't bring you in this world... but I will take you out!"" She's so cute.Anyway, If you want a chance at survival in dangerous situations this game is a good starting point in LEARNING about the tools you'll need (minus the tanks and rocket launchers... unless that's your thing... I'm not one to judge). If you want to be a scared victim, learn how to use the phone to call the cops, and die waiting for them. Although, I don't think there's a game for that... mainly because GUNS ARE COOL AND EVERYONE LOVES SHOOTING THINGS AND BLOWING THINGS UP! But I digress... if there is a game like that, it's probably British.AUTHOR'S NOTE: Before anyone gets upset at me for my last comment I just want to point out that shooting a home-invader in the face with a gun is a whole lot quicker than beating him/her about the head and shoulders with a cricket bat (although ""ye ole willow wood"" has less moving parts). Also, keep in mind that criminals don't care about gun laws. Come to think of it, they may not care about cricket rules either... I don't know... maybe try this game bundled with Don Bradman Cricket 14, or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive bundled with Cricket Revolution. Regardless, I recommend this game.",1
7348,Crush Crush,2017.0,"I have 5 minutes of playtime because I was so disappointed in the game, and I'll be uninstalling right after I post this review.In the first couple minutes, you, apparently, hurt a girl somehow (I could not tell what happened from the video that played), a Cupid analogue (Q-Piddy or something) appears, promises to get you a date with her, and says ""Looks like you hurt her pretty bad! Excellent, she doesn't have health insurance*! You should offer to pay her bills**! But first, you'll need to get a job to earn some money"" and directs you to get a job as a burger flipper*** in order to pay off her hospital bills****. Then you're directed to talk to her and be nice to her and give her gifts until she likes you enough to go out with you**.* What an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.** This reinforces the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t idea that you perform niceness and are owed a date or sex in return, and worse, presents the idea that you could ""accidentally"" injure someone in order to have an opportunity to be nice to them in order to get a reward for it*** Okay so you should probably be living paycheck to paycheck on this salar- oh it's $10 every couple seconds and you have no costs.

5887,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewIt isn't the most scary game out there, but it's effective and interesting. The game starts to convince you to feel that it is a joke, and isn't supposed to be actually scary. Then, something silly catches you off guard and startles you. You laugh it off, embarressed. Then, there come Spooky's ""specimens,"" which are startling and not cute, which the you might not expect. The game adds more depth with a few references and rooms with silly morbid mini-games, which emphasizes how much you should actually fear ""Spooky."" Spooky is a very adorable character, too. I love her design and how she too seems like a joke at first, but then you start to realize she's pretty evil and crazy.

You can also join clans to battle with your clanmates, unlike CS GO, it has a better community. But its graphic is not that good as CS GO, plus it is indeed not that realistic (gives you a feeling of mobile phones). Weapons in game are kind of expensive too.

9509,Minion Masters,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat game, but I get disconnected from the servers right before victory screen, which not only negates my win, but kicks me out of game as well. Happened to 60% of all my matches in the last 12 hours, its unbearable to play and have half of your progress negated. Also had a thing happen where my teammate (not premade) was disconnected during the start of 2v2 battle, which not only ended the game, but gave me a deafeat as well.Until this is fixed, do not consider playing the game, it just invalidates all your progress and the time you spent on it. Also the in-game economy is kinda dumb, because all the units are in this rock-paper-scissors  relation where A counters B, B counters C, and C counters A, and thus top players are all relying on a strategy which consists of abusing a few very strong cards, that you can't get unless you spend a lot of hours on the game on average, thus making the game pay to win for many new players. And since every drop you get is RNG based, unless you are exceptionally lucky, you are looking at 50-60 hours of game-time to build one strong deck.But, the game is still young, and it is very fun to play, so these are mostly just concerns about its state. The main reason I'm not recommending is because of the constant win-negating connection issue which has completely ruined the game experience for me.",0
6577,Magic Duels,2016.0,"This is great. I played Magic: the Gathering from 4th to Urza Saga. A long time ago. And this is Magic. Fun, surprising, tactical and with the deep combo over combo and thousand possibilities.I play a lot. And try many games even if just for trying. And this game has the best ingame ongoing tutorial ever. They teach you the basics and send you to play. And as you encounter a card abillity, effect, that you havent seen before a popup appears explaining it and if you want play a mini tutorial quest - so you further understand that specific ability - and then just return at point in game that you were.The deck builder is a dream. You can filter for everything. Card Types, mana cost, etc. And again in a helping hand style they offer tons of deck buildups so you can understand the strategy of each one, chose the one you prefer, help chose cards to that strategy ... Really great.The Duels are fun. Very fun. No lags and when you think there's a bug read the cards again ;-DAgain with just a click or a scrool touch you can have all info on the card and in this zoom mode you have at side of the card avaiable all info about its abilities.  i notice they keep changing like things that weren't bad but they are always making it a bit better.BEST TCG  ",1
19016,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,I would have recommended this game 2 years ago. Now there are about 80 % less players than what it was. And it takes ages to find a match and if you do your ping is probably really bad. Aswell as that the Germans are op. Sadly this is the end of this beloved game.,0
8647,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter 100 hours in, heres my review. Quick and to the point. Wont repeat majority of what others stated.Lvls 1 - 45 = Same grind you have always done in every game.45 - End Game = Buy lvl 37 gear off AH, +7 some of it, Add some spirits. Run highest level dungeon in game, Bosses have 80% chance to drop NO LOOT at all. Dungeon lockout of twice a day. Spend 1+ Months farming level 45 gear. To then wait on Raid Content update. Week 1 Duplication exploit ruined economy, Week 2 Chili exploit re-ruined Economy. Week 3? If you did not take advantage during week 1 - 2 have fun grinding money for no real reason.PVP Rewards nothing currently, Pvp goes from Broken, To patched and break something else each week.Week 1 Mages press 2 for free wins, Week 2 If your a Paladin you can 1 v 4 people.MULTIPLE skills on each class do not work, Paladins cleanse literally does nothing, So you are forced to just watchs Dots tick on you. Multiple mage CC abilities do not actually CC.Taming gets extremely grindy and repetitive for little to no satisifaction of rewards. Marketplace (AH) is terrible, If you list a SUPER rare item your capped on how much you can sell it for, If you sell a SUPER abundant item, You must sell it for Sightly more then the Current going Price, Placing your item behind literal Thousands of copies, So it will take days or weeks to sell.In a Nutshell game was worth $30 for 100 hours. If All Japan server content was live in this version I could look past the bugs, annoyances, server lag, etc. etc. etc... but its just not.

The gameplay is very fast paced late game and with the sheer amount of content in endgame it's absurd this game is free.

I have gotten about 20 hours of enjoyment out of it without having to breach a paywall/by using what they offer as free to play... The game is fun, but if you really want to hunt anything other than a Mule Deer then you'll have to pay real money basically. Do I recommend this game? Sure, for 20 hours or so... after that no. If I said sure then surely this recommendation should say yes, but I'm marking it as a No. Yes... you can get a lot of fun out of just hunting Mule Deer, but that is a extremely small amount of the content of this game that you're being limited to, which is why I can't recommend this game in the long run.Edit: Another thing I dislike is for you to ""play"" on a multiplayer server you'll have to have a membership, if not then you can join someone elses... 7/10 of the Hosts I meet are normally♥♥♥♥♥holes that kick you when ever you say anything they dislike, for example... I was playing on this American Server and this host asked if I was a girl, I told him ""No, What made you assume that?"" and he said ""Either you're a girl or a super gay wolf"" I said ""Rude, is there a ignore command"" then he kicked me. I have also met hosts that'll say nothing at all to you, but they'll kick you the moment you fired on deer etc... Of course it is not the game's fault that hosts are terrible, but it sucks because of the paywall, If you want to play with your friends you will have to endure terrible hosts or have one of you purchase a membership.",0
12154,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017.0,"Awesome game, has a real competitive feeling and it's actually quite fun with the right players but on the other side it's really annoying when it comes to the fact that there's 90% of players in the game that are mentally ill, bad-mannered, and have some sort of itch to insult and mock females for their own pleasure, and lastly the rank disappears after a certain time of inactivity, sadly it doesn't just disappear but also your rank decreases a bit far and you'll have to climb up once again!

15285,School of Dragons,2018.0,"The only fun thing about this game is the flying, the rest is buy to win. Litterally. Quests are fun- at first. After about 20 minuets of a quest, it makes you go somewhere.....where you have to PAY REAL MONEY to get there. You also have to PAY REAL MONEY to delete a character, you have to PAY REAL MONEY to make a new character, you have to PAY REAL MONEY to get another dragon or gear, and the game money is worthless. This game is free because you cannot complete a quest without having to PAY REAL MONEY. =S    Therefore, there is nothing to do in the game but PAYING REAL MONEY.(best is 5 X, lowest score is 1 X) GRAPHICS: X  Hated graphics. It looks nothing like the movie, and certainly doesn't look like any other game Iv'e played. GAMEPLAY: XX  Poor gameplay. Like I said in the first paragraph, the gamplay is just quests you have to pay for. The only thing most people like about the game is you can fly your own dragons.LAG: XXXXX  I have never experienced lag or crashes in this game. It is pretty much the only thing they actually worked hard on.CONTROLS: XXXX Liked controls. Controls for School of Dragons are pretty good, a little to sensitive, but good.MULTIPLAYER: XXX People don't interact with each other much, but if you are in multiplayer, the better chance there is to recive lag.MULTIPLAYER CHAT: XXXX Like I said, people don't interact much in multiplayer, or chat. But, if bad people dicide to come in and say somthing bad in chat, it gives the person 3 chances to stop saying any bad thing he is saying, and if he doesn't stop- he will automaticly get kicked out of the whole game for an hour or so. Cool, right? This game has crack security!    It is positive, but you just can't play this without having to pay money. Thanks, leave a comment on how you feel!! :3 ",0

6504,Neverwinter,2016.0,"Let me put it simply.I've been playing off an on for a few years now, as I have not had time to play it like I want to. It's an MMO, when you look at MMO type RPGS, you get the same exact outcomes, Pay2win gear, for PVP, almost EVERY MMO has this, so no reason to frown at it becuase its pointless. If you like PvE games, this is a good game for it, however if your a PvP lover who refuses to pay money to win, go play an arcade style game. becuase there are very few MMOS that arent pay2win, and why do PvP games have pay2win? becuase how else are they going to pay for the game servers. It's got a pretty good story, and its pretty old so performance on newer GPUs kind of cuased problems, but the game was programmed to run on older equipment, not much they can do about this, so complaining isnt going to get us anywhere.Will I continue to play? YesDo I recommend this game? Same with all mmos, if you dont like pay-2-win, go play something like COD, or as a great NPC said - Go cry on the forums like the little ***** you are, where no one cares.How do I rate this game? - seeing as there hasnt been any word of a newer Neverwinter Nights, 8/10",1

I had spend many many hours in Guild war 2, Planetside 2 and other F2P game. However, the way this game push its monetisation just leave a bad taste in my mouth. You start with crappy cards obviously, which is not really an issue at first. Then the difficulty ramps up and you hit a brick wall which no amount of skill will carry you through. You see, the card game mechanics is interesting, but it is not as flexible a system as say, magic the gathering. If the opponent's cards are much stronger than yours and/or their type of deck counter yours, eg:Rush deck vs your slow deck or AoE deck vs your creature spam. There is simpily no way to win without getting more powerful cards and/or redesigning your deck entirely, which also need more cards.Obviously, this is to push you into spending money on buying cards. However, when I hit a brickwall that no amount of skill can get me through, I am obviously feeling♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rubbing salt in my wound by showing an elaborated, unskippable animation of me losing AND then shoving in my face ""Do you want to spend $$$ and WIN?????"" prompt is just going to make me even more annoyed.TLDR: Game is worth a try for novelty sake, although you will notice its limitations fairly quickly and the monetisation modal is probably going to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.",0
3559,Team Fortress 2,2011.0,"I have one very specific complaint now.The new concept for matchmaking absolutely destroyed my TF2 experience. Introducing the forced BO3 format for casual games with an obligatory map voting afterwards drastically shortened the average game span. And most of the people leave after their map finishes because usually something else is chosen in the idiotic voting.Games are short, and people rotate like strangers in public transport.Now why do I hate this? The old TF2 was unique to me in that when I went into a game, probably on a server I knew and had in favourites, I could meet or make some friends or rivals. And the rivalry has been the key concept of TF2 since its 2007 beginning -- might I remind you the nemesis system and how well all the cosmetics and taunts fit into it by making one's appearance memorable and intentional.In the current environment it's near impossible to get personal, because the games are simply too short for any love to be able to bloom on the battlefield.Everybody feels anonymous, there is no reason to try build a team spirit if I'm going to be playing with different people 3 minutes from now. ""But Marekk you old ♥♥♥♥, why not go to a community server if you like them so much?"" Well tell you what, community servers are dead, and not without help from the official servers' availability. Of course, official infrastructure is a blessing. And it was working perfectly well for a long time before this new matchmaking arrived, and it was great.But what did we trade that for?

898,WARMODE,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewPeople who downvoted this game, ITS IN EARLY ACESS. That means things will change, they will implement things better, add new things, make it fun, ya know? I put only 3.6 hours into it and i already find it quite fun. Let me break down the game a bit and what I think are the pros and cons of this game so far:PROS:Great graphics for an early acess! They are amazing for a free to play shooter!Gameplay is fast-paced, very fun.The gun selection is quite nice, although some, like the AK47 and the AUG need a bit of balancing.CONS:The teams can get out of balance incredibly quick. it could be a 3v1 and I have seen games as far away as 5v2. Although I have seen some good players, they aren't that good.The semiauto shotgun is a bit op, as it does a lot of damage from a farther range you are used to.There is only one game mode at the moment. Even though it is still an amazing game for early access, one game mode puts me off a bit.Most of the weapons you can get a tapshoot kill with, which is dissapointing, because i would rather have only a few weapons that that can one hit kill, which would mean balancing out all of the assault rifles, and balancing up the smgs.All in all, a great game for early acess. Recommend it for experienced gamers. Great job WARTEAM!",1
14442,Champions Online,2018.0,"The peole who worked on this also did Star Trek Online? Slap yourselves on the wrist! That game makes this game look like absolute garbage. For starter, character creation. What I like about STO is that while you can't have but 3 classes and a handful of traits, it was never obvious when I started that it wanted m credit card info. In Champions, you only get a small fraction of the archetypes. And most of them can't stand alone when fighting on level. Next, STO had good faces. It was gonna come out eventually. These faces, I mean come on. I understand that this is from 2009, but do you mean to tell me that in 9 years, nobody ever thought to update these mutants? In STO, everyone looks like a supermodel, and I won't miss that when I play this. I know I'm making a lot of STO references, but I love that game, and this one could be so much better. No shooter style controls. I hate games where looking in another direction needs you to hold down a key. I'll admit, for a while I sucked at STO. But I still liked it and eventually I got rather decent at it. I'd get mad, but I'd learn the more I play. This garbage fire has over 3 days of time invested into it on my account, and I still only find satisfaction in character creation and walking around the arena part of the hub. If you want a MMO superhero game, get DCUO. You'll have to choose between playing as Pam Anderson or Arnold Schwarzenegger with powers, but it's a small price to pay. And while I'm on the topic.

By that I mean it's a big map with a lot of mounatains and open space-Seems to be an FPS cap, around 60-70 frames, hope that's removed soonOverall:-I'm a big fan of pubg and this game is like an easier, more optimized, slightly faster paced, potentially more fun, version of it. From choosing a loadout and your spawn point in the beggining to the oh-so-sweet chopper evac at the end, it's a fun and interesting ride.

19265,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter skipping updates A-C, I thought it was a good time to revisit at D-Update. Boy Squad 2.0 is not what I expected it to be. I am un-offically calling this update ""Reto's Choke Collar"". Why is it a choke collar you might ask? Before you used to get into a squad of 6 infantry and play with your friends and switch classes/ Assult teams while in game... Now you are stuck to one assult team( with the exception of this stupid auxillary seat system which I will get to later). So bascially, If mid war game you were resupplied with say tanks, and you wanted to use them you would need essentally psychic powers to be able to tell the future and make sure you've chosen the correct auxillary squad seat, and on top of that you need to be the squad leader to make sure you have that auxillary seat. No, just stop right there Reto. This is not squad 2.0, this is squad 1.0000000001. For literally years I've been waiting for a squad system that will do the following:1. Invite who I want2. Invite However many I want(6-12 players seem fine)3. Choose what Role to play4. Join a game a 1 unit/clanNow its impossible to join a specific War battle as a solo player. You know whats stupid, To be able to invite more friends I need to unlock these damned ribbons; rather I need to spend credits/gold to invite the same number of friends as I could before this update??? Thats like... you going to your favorite hot dog stand and you always paid 2.50$(usd) for a hotdog with whatever toppings you wanted then suddenly one day, the hot dog guy says: "" Yo times are tough its gonna be an extra .50 cents per topping...""

I don\'t recommend this game to anyone.Developer response:Reto.Circinus  [developer] Posted: Feb 25 @ 9:22amGringojs, you never got banned for your constructive critism on the game and admittedly, you had some good topics and posts like that as well. The primary reason why we suspended your forum account is that you were harassing and intentionally provoking other players, which would result in flame wars. You know our rules, you have been active on the forums and the game for a long time, yet you continued to violate them even after we suspended your account. You have received plenty of warnings prior to your permanent suspension from the forums.Look at this from our perspective as well please, We\'d love to spend more time on critism and constructive feedback, but the Developers naturally get discouraged to read the forums when\'s too much trolls and flamers running around spoiling a lot of the topics.As Reto.Robotron3000 said it: When you decided to start flaming devs & other players and posting troll posts on the forums we had to ban you, just like we would do with *any* other player.

12432,GUNS UP!,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewOkay peope lets be real. PROGRAMMING IS REALLY F****** TOUGH!I couldn't log on even once after downloading the game due to a fairly widespread connection issue to the servers (the devilish -3008 (05) error. I put out a few (to many) comments on various chats and forums and within a day or two had recieved a reply. A day later I recieved a personal friend invite from one of the Developers who then went through a rather long process of gather information from my cmd prompt and such that I sent over for him. He was precise, asked detailed questions and was super helpful. He is now as I write this chatting with the dev team about trying to get to the bottem of the issue! Yes it's similar to a mobile game. Yes there are in game purchases (a necessary way for programmers to earn a living off of a Free to play game I may add) but the team has been incredible in trying to track down what is clearly an extremely tricky bug! I am so pleased with the responses and effort of the team and they deserve an A* even if the games not exactly The Witcher 3 or something!",1
7212,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2018.0,"Had this game for the longest time on mobile. Many many new boxes have come into play with the game, and made the game all the more interesting. However, playing in PVP is kinda unforgiving. The new meta decks everyone has been using is really making the game feel extremely repetative and not very fun. Don't get me wrong, the game itself is amazing and I really like they brought out the characters to the game.But if you're looking to get competative in it, you might as well dish out money in order to get the best cards or get really involed in events to score rare cards. Overall, great game to play. I do recommend for casual players, for competative players it's a hit or miss.",1

968,Realm of the Mad God,2016.0,So I played this game for a long while. What deca (yes I'm looking at you /u/sil3x) could do to make the game better is to look over some of the community dungeon ideas. Some of these ideas are so good that they are more polished than dungeons that are already in the game. But you guys are already doing such a great job getting straight to work fixing duping and still being able to interact with us and host fun events. Keep it up :)To any new people looking at this game it is worth playing if you can get past the constant death at the beginning.,1
17309,Magic Duels,2016.0,"I like the game a lot more since season 2, because the quests are now worth more gold and are doable with own made decks. First win of the day is cool too. There is a couple of very big flaws: Sometimes cards dont do what they are meant to do. I hate the fact that people can disconnect in game and then do not lose rank.  I really hope you guys do something about that. ",1

1574,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2017.0,"Donald J. Trump Inauguration SpeechEvery four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent, thank you.Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people.For too long a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed.The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country.Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there has been little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.This is your day.This is your celebration.And this – the United States of America – is your country.What truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people.January 20 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now.You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement –  the likes of which the world has never seen before.Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighbourhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves.These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.But for too many of our citizens a different reality exists.Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.An education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealised potential.We are one nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, we share one nation, one home and one glorious destiny.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.We are one nation and their their pain is our pain; their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny.The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidised the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our own military.We've defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own.And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.But that is the past and now we are looking only to the future.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power – from this day forward a new vision will govern our land – from this day forward it's going to be only America first – America first!Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries, making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down.America will start winning again; winning like never before.We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.We will build new roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labour.We will follow two simple rules – buy American and hire American.We will seek friendship good will with the nations of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.We do not seek to impose our way of live on anyone but, rather, to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow.We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones, and unite the civilised world against radical Islamic terrorism which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America. And through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice.The bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly but always pursue solidarity.When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.There should be no fear: we are protected and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement. And most importantly we will be protected by God.Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.The time for empty talk is over; now arrives the hour of action.Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail; our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their hearts with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: you will never be ignored again.Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny.Together we will make America strong again; we will make America wealthy again; we will make America proud again; we will make America safe again; and yes – together we will make America great again.Thank you.God bless you.And god bless America.",1

Especially with the mechanic that you have to win to earn in game currency a real party since you lose about 50 % of the games you would actually win due to the constant crashing.Can be fun to play while it lasts but with the constant crashes I would not recommend playing the game let alone pay a single dime!,0

7534,Creativerse,2017.0,"I've played 44 hours so far, so I think I can make a review about it. The game is very similar with Minecraft, so most of the stuff from there would be here aswel.Here are some pros and cons.PROS:-The game is free to play.-It's so simple to make the server and to have others join. You can make it private (just for you and friends) or you can make it public and have a lot of ppl join in.-The game have nice features to protect yourself from trolls and noobs. -Good graphics! -You can rotate every block in the game (even furniture), so you can build cool structures and have good decorations.-The game is harder than minecraft, it has a nicer combat imo.-It takes much longer to build and craft stuff wich i find it more compeling-You have a sense of progression. You unlock recipes by descovering blocks and crafting stuff.-The game lets you build your own adventure and share it with the community. (not something that i find fascinating, but its a nice feature)-You can customize your character.CONS:-The game has some bugs. The ladder is so annoying, you won't fit on it properly, you have to struggle, it feels like the character is to big to fit into a 1 block gap with the ladder. Sometimes when you close doors or traps, you get pushed into the air and fall to death. You can farm some resources with ease (diamonds and coals), by using glitches. Sometimes when you use a potion or food to regen, it won't activate. (Those bugs are rare, not something that will annoy you, beside the ladder, that is so annoying, but they need to be fixed).-The game doesn't have weather (rain, snow, thunderstorms.... ect.), instead it has a temperture that it shows up whenever you are in a specific zone (savannah is really hot and you can burn to death or in the mountains you can freeze to death if you don't have a fire nearby). The temperature is a really nice feature, but combined with weather or seasons, that would have been so much better and insane!!! -The tree leaves won't decay. They just stay in the air after you take a tree down.-FPS problems in the multiplayer. Rare small rollbacks (not something that will be a problem). Need to be better optimised. Not a big problem, not something that will occur everytime.-The game need to have more monster models, more adventures. Portals to other worlds. Bosses need to be added. More content would really make the game better.-The game does not have a hunger feature in it. You can't starve. You can craft food however and use it to regen your health.-Wanted to see some zombies in it. Wanted to see some random villages with npcs that can sell stuff like it minecraft. Adding humanoids would have been nice.-Wanted to see more blocks and decorations.My conclusion:The game is really nice to play with friends and to have that minecraft vibe in a f2p game. The game have nice graphics and new mechanics and ideas that you can't see in Minecraft, but it also lacks several cool features from Minecraft. The game could really become incredible if more content were to be added into the game. Beside the issues that it has and the lack of some features, it's stil a very good game, one that I enjoyed so far and will play it more. I recommend it! I also hope the game will be active and the devs will improve it over the next months and years.",1
3834,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFreeJam ♥♥♥♥ed up a perfectly good game.1 year ago, this game was great. The game was based on a tier progression system, depending on your robot's ranking which was decided upon the blocks used to build the robot. Starting from tier 1, to 10. That system is now long gone for more than a year. What came after that was CPU matchmaking. Based on CPU consumption on your robot, you would be put with stronger enemies. So that ♥♥♥♥ed up the game. And guess what they did after that. Yeah. You guessed it. They ♥♥♥♥ed it up even more. How? The currency used in the game called RP (along with GC, premium currency) were both eradicated. Instead came a lousy universal currency called Robits. So how do you get Robits? You don't. Before, you would earn credits based on your game performance, good games could earn you lots of RP, which were then turned into Robits (divided by 10 or 100 or 1000) after the update. If you didn't have much RP before the update, the game simply would laugh at you in the future. So guess what they did. They introduced a loot system. Instead of spending your hard earned money how you want to, now, based on game performance, you get crates which reveal loot (NOT money) which can mostly be♥♥♥♥♥♥because you need to be extremely lucky to get something rare, so do get something rare you need to sell items so that you can get robits but selling items for robits gives something like 50-1000 robits so in each game unless you get a Platinum chest you get 50-1000 robits and rare items can cost up to 150,000 robits! WHAT?! DO THEY REALLY THINK THAT'S GOOD? So let's list some Pros and ConsPros:-Creativity, now limited.-...Nothing elseCons:-Lousy server-Horrible loot system-Terrible dev team-Overpriced items-Time taking grind marathon-Items that cost WAY too much and are not good whatsoever (remember the Aeroflak? anyone?)-Playerbase that is made of absolute Toxic Waste gathered from Chernobyl, assembled in a laboratory and ♥♥♥♥♥ed upon-FJ Guard dogs-Tons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥terryTL;DR: This game is worse than killing yourself.

10872,Brawlhalla,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you just started this game and thought that there are certain legends more OP than others, or spamming is ruining the game, give yourself some time to learn the game. Almost every fighting game has spammers which are really easy to deal with once you get the hang of it.But as for legends? Every legend is seriously balanced (while some are underpowered and hard to master, but if you like challenge and have some patience, they'll certainly do the same job as other legends). Devs listen to the community and they keep balancing the game on regular basis (every week or something).I for one hated my first time in game when I faced the wave of spammers (and hattoris heh), but thank god I met some of the nicest and greatest players in the community, they helped me understand the basic mechanics of the game and how to deal with such stuff easily. I'm posting this for those people with low luck of meeting some nice players and wanna quit after their 30 minutes of playing.

6880,Fractured Space,2018.0,Played since November of last year. The game is great for all but one aspect. Graphics great. Gameplay not bad (or used to be not bad). The BOT AI is really nothing but cheat code. No real AI at all. And it just gets worse and worse. I have not seen one single team win a game in days now. None. They have repeatedly been asked to hire a DEV to write a real BOT AI but refuse to listen.  The game is now unplayable. Want proof? Over 6k members but only around 100 a day now. Does that tell you anything?  And a real shame. I really loved this game and spent a fair amount of money supporting it. I own all the ships in the game. I want (ed) the game to succeed. But I doubt that is going to happen now. I can't believe they would trash their own game over one DEV (BOT AI DEV) when the rest are doing such a great job. Sorry to see this happen.

16171,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWell, I am joining a long list of dissatisfied customers that really wanted this game to be a good one.  I can't even say that i enjoyed the game that much due to all the glitches, poor translation, and combat system.  I bailed at just over two hours hoping to come back if the developers actually finish this game.  I do understand it is Early Access but that is not a free pass on amking a crappy game and having customers finance your slow development process.Here is my list of gripes:- Horrendous translation issues (I shouldn't have to Google how to play your broken game)- Combat system is a bust and chaining fails more often than works. CQB will leave you standing there like an idiot while you get beat down.  Reviewers are stating that this gets ""better"" as you level but how is basic combat broken but advanced combat isn't?  I left the game at 12Level (see what I did there?) and it showed no signs of getting better.- Early access was a poorly executed joke at best.- Optimization is crap!  There are so many U3 games on the market that are amazing that there literally is no excuse for not having this game run well.  This is a dev team tragedy and a sign that they are lazy.  If this is the early acces of a game thats been in development for 7 years and deployed in three regions for almost three years, how are we to have any faith that they will ever fix these issues.  If you stick it out, you're a better gamer than me.  I honestly see this game as another DayZ!  Four years in ""Early Access"" is just shameful and Bless is following suit.  All of the problems NA/EU players are experiencing are echoes of what has been published through Russia and Korea reviews.  You'll know the end is near when they start merging servers because of low server pops.Get a refund of the game and wait it out.

5168,Realm of the Mad God,2018.0,This is one of the most rage inducing games i have ever played but somehow i still get dragged back into playing it. Example you'll grind for like 4-8 and then have good tiered stuff and your mind is like ahhh finally i have made a charcter that will live forevr and then pretty much after you start getting those thoughts just get off because your gunna ♥♥♥♥ing die the next second. The moments after dieing are the worst becasue your either super salty or in rage mode because of deca's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥servers. * in a duegeon lags and cant close realm and then 5 seconds later the servers are abck and then ohh your dude that you spent hours on is just ♥♥♥♥ing dead not even because of you its casue of deca* this game is so weird when you get mad you get offand your basically are calling the game trash but somehow you contiounsly get dragged back in this game . This game is highly addicting one you start to grasp how to play. I would recommend getting started everything is pretty much pay to win because you have to buy a good pet you have to my space in your vault you have to buy everything and sadly i have spent money and i regret it because it just makes me want to play more so i can get my ♥♥♥♥ing moneys worth. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND,0
17405,Crush Crush,2018.0,"A very cute game with lots of unlockable content. Pretty easy to grind if you check in every few days or so-remember that they only keep your savings and you can't earn any more after a week! I love the dialogue and humor behind the game-it's very self-aware and I can laugh along at myself with how silly the whole concept is. Each character has their own individual charm and quirks and it is well worth the wait to try and unlock them all, alongside becoming their top-tier lover ;)For a free to play game, it has some really decent art and the in-game purchases aren't too bad. You earn enough jewels on your own to purchase some pretty good time slots and anything else you may need. Music is also very nice, you can adjust the audio settings if you need. I personally haven't purchased the DLC or any microtransaction type things so I can't comment on that process, though I would likely show my support to the studio in the future.Overall, fun game, good for a bit of time wasting and checking in on whatever cute girl they have available at the time. Lots of variety in characters and a good laugh. :)",1
8361,DCS World Steam Edition,2018.0,"I loved this game. I played it for years. But I tried to get back into it, and bring a buddy of mine as well, and realized - you have to spend (WITH A DISCOUNT) 745+ dollars to unlock ALL of the content within the game. To only raise even higher, when the new Aircraft (such as the F18) comes out as well.This is ridiculous, it's unbecoming, it's near criminal, and disgusting. I will not be getting my friends involved in this game again.<3EDIT 7/18/2018 - If you buy an aircraft on STEAM, you can't use it on Standalone. Standalone updates at different rates than STEAM at times. So if you buy the plan on STEAM, and play on a server, you can't use that plane on Standalone, you have to wait 2 days to a week until it's updated and you can play on your normal server again.",0
14657,Digimon Masters Online,2016.0,"Ok first off the new Digimon they added Devilmon is already spelled wrong! It is Devimon! DEVIMON! I they actually knew their digimon and cared about the fans who would get upset about this they would take the time to correct tons of the digimon's names they have spelt wrong as Devimon isn't the first. Second I started playing the game before it ever came to steam and in honesty it is just as bad or even worst. They force you to practically choose between the three main characters from Season 5, but it seems they have added the characters from Season 1 however I still refuse to play, and this causes a lot of issues as most people would like to create their own character instead of just choosing someone from a selcet few no matter how much I myself like Marcus I don't want to constantly play him.Third the actual game play is extremely buggy and sometimes my game will just crash after one mission. I'm sorry I don't want to just go and restart the game after ever mission it is a waste of time.Four they also want money for different items and such which only makes me laugh. Here tons of people are spending money for the game, money you could be using to impove the game, and it seems to be going no where. Why spend money on a game that won't get any better.For my closing statement the game should honestly not even be on steam. It wasn't good before it was on it and now that it is a lot of people including myself thought it would be better only to find out nothing has changed. This game is not worth the time to play nor the money to spend on it. I rest my case here and hope the Devs just take the game off steam and close it down period also if I seem harsh well if you are a major fan of digimon just the misspelling of the names should upset you especially Devimon being he is the first major evil digimon in the game and should be respected as such.",0
16419,Crush Crush,2018.0,"Honestly can be a lot of fun. The art is top quality, the dialogue is often very funny, and there's plenty of variety in both the nerdy references and fetishes represented. There's even something of an overarcing story to be completed. That being said, I do have my reservations. The game takes a long time, even for a clicker. You can progress really quickly, until you start reaching the later stages of the game (say, unlocking Eva or Luna). There is no way to increase the speed at which things happen after you reach a reset bonus of 2048, without spending gems in the store. Late game, it also highly encourages gem purchases, as some characters (see Luna and Eva again), require items that are so expensive it's almost impossible to buy them with in game $$$, or they require such a high amount of hearts that the super expensive magical gem items are the best way to progress. Also, sometimes with events the developers can be difficult. There is often not a lot of reward for a player who bought an outfit if that outfit is the event reward, and only recently they have added a ""You missed the event! Spend gems to get the reward!"" This is a problem in and of itself however, as it said this in my game, which prompted me to buy gems to get the reward, only for me to realize before I spent the gems, that I actually DID have the rewards from the event, so it seems it says that no matter what? This can accidentally trick a player into spending gems, and if you do buy it while already owning the items it just says ""You got the (Whatever the reward is)"" and doesn't really benefit you.Final Review:4/5Fun game with fantastic art, but not a lot of love shown to F2P players later on in the game, and the notifications and messages in game can sometimes be confusing.",1
7794,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"While this game may suffer from typical japanese waifu/husbando tropes I'd say this game is quite one of the best TCG/CCG games out there if you want depth and flexibility. The main story suffers from the same issue mentioned above but at least it's something compared to say Hearthstone which just puts Warcraft lore into a blender.+ Lots of diverse cards/playstyles avail.+ Awesome art direction and sound presentation overall.+ Crossplatform for say Android/iOS.+ Free stuff offered compared to say HS which blatantly DEMANDS you buy packs for $$$.+ Easy to get into as a noob/casual, as the tutorial levels scale accordingly.+- Suffers from waifu/husbando trope. Which is a hit or miss for some I suppose ¯\_(ツ)_/¯+- Playing competetive can be either fun (and/)or frustrating as it doesn't use say Blizzards typical 50/50 W/L ratio system.- Minor complaint for Android graphic settings but I guess that's just nitpicking in my case.While it's not as deep or time-consuming as Magic.

8468,Magic Duels,2015.0,"The game had a lot riding for it. From the potential, to its namesake, to the cards themselves. Alas, there are more things wrong with it than good. The ""storyline"" is pitiful, and the decks they give you for those battles? Abysmal. That's not to say they couldn't have been good, they could. But they weren't. The musical score behind each battle is intriguing to say the least, and has a very nice feel to it. However, none of this even compares to the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor attempt at card selling. Either you waste hard-earned cash from the real world, or you work your♥♥♥♥♥off at trying to farm up enough coins to buy a booster. There is no middle ground. No viable free card selection, and hardly even a method (yet, and I hope they change this because if they do I'll re-think my entire thought-process for this game) of buying individual cards for a set amount. In short, if you're a masochist and poor this is the game for you. If you have even 30 bucks to spare, I'd recommend overlooking this entirely and buying yourself an actual deck of cards you can play with your buddies with.Pros:Good MusicNice cardsCons:No method of buying individual cardsPoorly made storyline+storyline decksHard to begin without spending your money.Abysmal booster pack system.Very bad over all feel to a once beloved game.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE.",0
14190,World of Warships,2017.0,"WoWS is overall a decent game, so why the downvote you may ask. I gave this game a downvote because of two reasons:1. Wargaming. This is an awful company you should think twice about throwing money at. WoT is notoriously infamous for it's inbalances and P2W policies. Gladly WoWS is not nearly as broken as WoT, but since we're talking about WG it's only a matter of time if you ask me. 2. Playerbase. It's not the toxicity, it's the unbelieveable incompetence that breaks the game, especially on weekends when all our beloved weekend warrios login. ""Blame the players, not the game"" is especially true in this game. Yes, the game is flawed, but ultimately what breaks the game is the people playing it. The second issue could easily be resolved by either implementing skill based MM or making ranked play more available (It's limited to short periods of time and specific tiers only).Unfortunately WG relies on those masses of extremely bad players, who godknowswhy oppose skill based MM, as source of income since the game is F2P, so nothing will change.

788,Neverwinter,2013.0,"I would say first, it is really an action game using RPG elements more than an actual RPG. While you do have the ability to customize your characters stats and abilities and you do take quests, there is really only one way to complete quests, which is to kill everything between you and the quest marker and then talk to whoever is waiting for you at the end. Further, even though this character is a rogue, I don't pick locks or pockets. I can disable traps, but in a group everyone runs through the dungeon so quickly there is no point in trying to disable anything.That said, the combat is pretty fun and action packed. I tried the PVP arena for the first time yesterday and had a blast. And then there is the Foundry. The Foundry allows players to create their own adventures that other people can then go through. I've tried a few and they seem to be pretty creative and fun (my earlier screenshots with the dancing skeletons and the upside down world were from two different foundry quests.) Once you are done with a Foundry quest you can then rate it for others.Overall I would say the game is pretty good, I have been having enough fun to keep going back",1

Fast Progression6. Third person makes it unique to other MOBAs7. In game store only has cosmetics (NOT P2W)8. Good community9. Fast paced (Quick games depending on the game mode)10. 90 different gods to play as11. Periodic sales and good deals in the storeCons -1. Unbalanced gods2. Matchmaking (Noobs every game)3. Store isn't reasonably priced (Expensive)4. Devs updates don't change the correct things (god balancing, item balancing, or game mode changes)Now, of course these are MY opinions for pros and cons.

My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

11187,Fractured Space,2017.0,"Honestly, this is one of the best f2p game that exist bar none. The grinds are not bad and the rewards are decent. The best part about this game are the DEVELOPERS which I have said about no other game ever. They read the forums and will react to feedback sometimes responding to your post directly. I have literally only had 2 issues with the game and after submitting a ticket they were resolved in less than 24 hours. The gameplay is good but not overly complicated. The graphics are good but again strike a good balance for my machine aka I can run everything on high but not ultra. This game is a great fit for me because I do not have a bunch of free time and just want to unwind for a couple of hours and get in a few co-op matches and snatch a few drop pods. So if you are a casual gamer who doesn't have a ton of free time I highly recommend you give it a spin. It is easy to learn but not so easy to master so there is depth.  The maps look good, the ships look good the ai is decent. If you are more competitive it can accommodate that as well.

16887,Star Trek Online,2018.0,"Aside from the mere 3,474 hours I've played here, I played another 500 or so thus far using the official ARC launcher. This is the only game I've come back to. I understand some people complain about grinding, or about purchasing things etc. However, there are two things which make this formula acceptable, and here is why: the Devs continually modify and add to the game - they can't be expected to work for free. Secondly, in no way do you feel like you need to buy stuff with real money. If truth be told, most of what you might buy would either be some specific ships or extra docks (and of course, the EC cap). Sure, you can buy whatever else you'd like if you really want to, but you don't really need to. Considering that Zen is the currency which can be bought with real money, it should be noted that dilithium (an ingame only currency) can be obtained and then traded for Zen.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: PROS :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Spock... is in the game. Leonard Nimoy's voice lives on in the game, alongside many, many other characters.Game mechanics are really good, and I consider them to be the norm on which any space game should be created upon.You can customize your characters with a fairly decent amount of costumes.An incredibly huge assortment of ships, and always growing.The Borg... as powerful as advertised in the shows and movies.Content has been either changed or removed/added in the past to improve the storyline.Every faction (Fed/Klingon/Rom) have a specific storyline until it merges.Each faction has a huge assortment of ships to select.Crafting system is extremely simple, and unique items can be obtained in such a way.Select whatever type of weapon types: phaser, disruptor, polaron, tetryon, anti-proton, plasma and other.Good voice acting.Global official giveaways - ships and items - and special events.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: CONS :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::The Borg... they drain your shields like it was nothing, and you can't do a thing about it - but that's also a Pro.Not as much content as I'd like.You do have to grind quite a bit, depending on what you want to achieve.The reputation system doesn't unlock every tier for every character once unlocked (this process is tedious), and takes 20 days at the very least, and 40 days initially (20 days once you obtain Sponsorship Tokens).Not enough costumes, hairstyles or beardstyles.Some specific characters cannot be modified, costume wise.Some races are not playable (yet), such as Cardassians, Breen, Vortas/Jem'Hadar, although you can usually create the look of most of them. Takes a while, of course.Personally, I have experienced frequent disconnects at some point (not always, but maybe once a month).Graphics are a bit dated, despite some improvements.

The game play is very fun, .The only disadvantage newer players have is there skill level, This game is very similar to leaque of legends in that case.Negatives.The learning curve is not terrible, however you are likely to spend your first hundread hours grinding for ships you want to try out, I recommend you watch all of the ship tutorial videos.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_16n3wjUA8&list=PLewyUR6qbD2kIiytyzYVX-ZCsdcy0C9Dt"".The game is still a work in progress even today. They are often making changes to gameplay and reblancing shipsInclusion I would recommend the game, it is a ton of fun and I still enjoy it every time I play it. There is nothing more satisfying than winning a 1 v 1 or getting 20 kills and no deaths, I do not recommend playing for wins, you will only become sad D: No matter what your going to lose some games. But you can find joy in the combat it self or focus more towards your personal stats in the game. ",1
9934,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game is Early Access and it shows.Being a free to play game and about 6GB in size, there is no reason not to play it if you enjoy tower defense games.All transactions for the game are cosmetic or inventory increases (basic quality of life).The game is definitely enjoyable for a while. However the flaw is quite clear with a game following the road of ""item levels"". It turns into an MMO. Each hero only has 4 towers meaning a current total of 16 options. For those who enjoy a bit more complexity and variation, this gets boring fast. Using item levels forces you to grind for gear for most of the game to reach the next difficulty, ultimately putting you in a position of what to do after getting through the hardest maps. Also for the hardest difficulties, there is little room for variation on towers, there is a specific towers requirement essentially and also a gear requirement for heros to play certain roles properly in order to succeed.The use of heros is fun and fine, but in the end due to the power of enemies and many lines, you have to rely on towers more. Unless you enjoy grinding for gear or can find some form of enjoyment after obtaining the best gear without being bored, this game ultimately falls short. The more classical mazing tower defenses or those with 40+ variations and multiple upgrade options will remain a more entertaining option for those seeking a true tower defense game. The only reason I can truely recommend it is because it is free. Otherwise it would be worth $5 at most.Personal experience score: 6.5/10Story: 1/10 - Really none as of this writing, game may or may not have story to it laterSound: 9/10 - Pretty good music and sounds to fit the mapsGraphics: 10/10 - Very nicely done, keeping in mind the art style chosen for the gameControls: 9.5/10 - Very easy to use, just sometimes you get stuck on terrain partsGame Length: 8/10 - Fun for about 30-50 hours",1
16266,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAnother Battle Royale game joins the market. But I like this. Why? No building. Good touch with melee weapons vs guns.

2004,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2016.0,"This game is a lot of fun if you can get past the graphics and the fact that there aren't nearly as many players as more popular MMOs. If you're a fan of the LOTR books or movies, this game will be even better and more immirsive. Basically, just try it, what's the worst that could happen?

8786,Champions Online,2014.0,"The game had a lot of potential to be the best Superhero MMO out there, the customization options were endless, the Nemesis feature was really promising, the universe it was based on was a remarkable and fresh universe compared to the tired dc and marvel heroes we have seen again and again and the stories it featured were really interesting until......Until Perfect world entertainment took over and decided to simply milk the shop for as long as it lasts. The game now only features broken and buggy missions, unbalanced pvp, no support and the only new content would be two or three laughable word missions every millenium along with a underwhelming alert. All of which are served as a way to pitch to the players more crap from the shop like useless vehicles........",0

12854,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2017.0,"Great graphics, not a bad game but the 22 gig download is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥poor when you only get 3 tracks and 1 car with EVERYTHING ELSE is pay to play including tracks. Pretty dissappointing when every other game allows you to unlock basic vehicles and tracks as you progress with premium packages offering higher end vehicles normally unavailable to people not willing to pay. This limits the players who have bought premium packages/vehicles to competition by others and limiting the field of play yet again by putting paid players at a dissadvantage. Finally, if you have the couple of hundred dollars to unlock all vehicles and tracks  then you might be finding yourself playing the game with one or 2 others like Bill Gates who can actually afford to play. Good luck with the game guys but not for me when EVERYTHING comes at a cost. Yes I know you can test drive vehicles before you buy them but once again these are ONLY test drives, all up I give the game a thumbs up for graphics but a BIG THUMBS DOWN for the download size and lack of content. Obviously a game for the elite in society , good luck guys but this is one game that is GONE from my steam account as stated above. All up this game sux HARD CORE for content and playability.",0

14903,DCS World Steam Edition,2014.0,"A truly evolving combat flight simulation. The platform started as Lock on: modern air combat in 2003. Since then, the developer decided to part ways with Ubisoft and successfully made a niche for themselves. DCS world is the ""World of tanks"" for modern flight simulation. Its still in its infancy with the scope. Things are constantly being updated/added and it has become a premier flight simulation. The graphics engine is dated with more CPU intensive processes, but the engine is due for a change with a revolutionary new EDGE (Eagle Dynamics Graphic Engine) that should be released this year. The planes are represented in painstaking detail. The physics for each plane is the most accurate representation in any flight simulation, including military trainers.The base game is free and allows you to fly the Su-25T and TF-51D. But the others can be purchased through addons. There are two lines of DCS addons:DCS: xxxx  :: Fully detailed aircraft including clickable cockpits. You need to spend 3-5 min just starting up the aircraft. Just like pilots in real life.DCS: xxxx Flaming cliffs :: A study simulation. There are easy one button presses to get the systems/avionics going, but the aircraft physics is still modelled very much like the DCS counterparts.At the end of the day, this is one of those MUST PLAY SIMULATIONS if you like flying aircraft. They still have a way to go with limited campaigns, dated graphics etc.. but things are improving with every version.Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 7/10Audio: 7/10Replayability: 9/10MUST PLAY. ENDLESS HOURS OF ENTERTAINMENT.",1
410,Star Trek Online,2012.0,"For the price (free!), it is not a bad game. You can create a character for each of the three main political states - Federation, Klingon & Romulan. There are a variety of races to choose from and you get to customize your character (and supporting NPC crew members) for free (first time only). I saw a lot of buxom & statuesque female Vulcans even one bald but for a top knot (very blonde hair) and a tattoo around one eye back going back towards the ear.Some of the game mechanics feel clunky & some cut screnes (shuttlecraft wobbling all over the place as it comes in for a landing on Vulcan) leave something to be desired. And if you want to really get serious in the game and get the good stuff, you will have to buy (as in $) special credits (or earn them which takes a lot of grinding). Missions included space & ground and you can even get involved in fleet actions (versus Klingons, Gorns, Romulans, Borg, etc). For the first MMO I have really played, Crunch had a good time (not playing much these days) and recommends it if you are looking for a casual or serious MMO. He rates it 7.5 out of 10.",1

1086,DCS World Steam Edition,2018.0,"TLDR up front: Has its pros and cons as a game, but if you aren't A: loaded, and B: a super-hardcore combat flight simmer, for the cons it has, this game seriously isn't worth your money... and oh boy, you are going to have to fork it up to buy in. If you want to know why I think that, read on.So, I have a few hours in the Steam version, and many, many more in standalone. I have a handful of modules. Why am I coming to Steam to make this review despite being a standalone player? Because seeing this in Steam is what got me to check it out in the first place, and I'm lucky I got my nose in the community enough to get warned away from the Steam version. As for the pros of this game, there are more than enough glowing reviews of this game to tell you the pros, so I'm going to focus on why I'm not recommending this. I'll save the problems with the Steam version for other negative reviewers in here, as they have more skin in the game than me. So here goes:My first gripe with this game is that the actual gaming content just isn't there. There's no dynamic campaign to speak of (what is this 1995?) despite dynamic campaigns otherwise being the industry standard, the mission editor is weak and doesn't have a big community (like Arma's) hammering out content, there is almost no professionally developed co-op content to speak of, multiplayer is lacking with the exception of a couple community dynamic campaigns, and the on-rails singleplayer campaigns are ""meh"" at best. Yeah, flying is fun, but if I was looking to have fun just flying I'd look at a different game, I'm here to fly high performance aircraft and blow stuff up. Eagle Dynamics (ED) needs to step their game up, literally. This game deserves much, MUCH better content, which leads in to my next point.That point is that the DLC modules (AKA the planes you buy), are obscenely expensive. This is a true example of the Gillette razor business model. They give you the razor for free, and they charge your pants off for the blades. Most of the planes in this game are sweet, they're thorough, they're modeled to a greater level than pretty much every other civilian simulation out there... but when you don't have the content in which to REALLY have fun with these modules, their intrinsic value drops like a rock. You cannot convince me to drop 80 bucks on an early access F/A-18, when AAA titles that have solid gameplay from start to finish, to post-completion are consistently $60. I have bills to pay ED, and not everyone that plays your game is some kind of filthy rich flight-sim snob that has hundreds and hundreds of dollars to blow on DLC. The absurd cost of these DLC modules seriously makes me think you guys believe that. I get that development is expensive, but you have to price this stuff at a level that makes sense for the consumer; and with the state of the gameplay itself, it really doesn't help justify the high cost of these modules.I am a pretty serious flight simmer, I have been at it since I was a little kid and the cost still just doesn't add up. $80 for a plane that I can jack around with in instant action, play a campaign that will be fun once and only once, hope there is some community developed co-op for (if I were actually able to get my friends into this game), or play multiplayer with a bunch of people I don't know... or I can pay $60 for a full feature AAA title that I know is going to be a great time? Heck, I'd probably rather just buy a $30 indie title that I know I will lose hundreds and hundreds of hours in. They charge you for the maps besides Georgia, they charge you for WWII assets, they charge the crap out of you for the buggy land warfare module, they charge you $60-70 for the other top-of-the-line modules, they charge you for additional campaigns. Assuming you already have a great rig to play this on; getting a HOTAS and headtracker (the minimum required peripherals IMO) AND the price it costs to get the full fidelity planes you want, the buy in cost for this game is ridiculous. That's not counting the cost of planes down the line, if you want to get into VR, or whatever other side assets like maps or vehicles they're going to charge you for.That's why I seriously don't recommend this game: the cost-to-fun ratio is seriously not there. That's coming from a sim-aviation enthusiast, and a general gaming enthusiast. Unless you see yourself building an all out sim-pit in the future, just about any other lower-fidelity combat flight simulator out there will give you a better time, and you actually have a chance to get some of your friends to buy in and play it with you.",0

You can invite friends (from steam) into a game (haven't tried as I have no mtg friends on steam) and can't make any.. because you cannot chat or interact with any other players aside from playing cards.

It's bound to happen sometimes when friendlies just run into your explosives or infront of your vehicle.- Can't make my character look cooler without buying cosmetics with real cashIt is a great game i recommend to my friends. It's really fun when you play with your friends or join an outfit. Highly recommended. ",1
11761,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2015.0,"Raceroom experience was a very frustrating experience!Update :- I have found a way to fix the main problem that I have with this game and that is to change traction control preset 0 from 0 to 100 in the car setup in the garage before a race (i.e. in practice or qualifying). I think what I was experiencing is called power on oversteer. Though I still cant believe that it should be anything like that bad in a real car :(Note this wont help you brake or go around a corner, it just means you wont spin off the track into the corner when you gently accelerate !I cant believe the developers have made this game so inaccessable when all they need to do is change 1 variable and it would be 30000 percent more playable to people who try the game !Btw I come at tihis as someone who generaly prefers more sim like games like gt legends, grid, dirt, test drive unlimited 2, nfs shift 2, race injection etc. But even with hundreds of experience on probably 20 different racing games I couldnt make it around a lap without it crashing from oversteer !I still hesitiate to recommend this game because of the sheer anount of frustration this issue caused meHere is my original review :-Raceroom experience is a very frustrating experience!This is mainly down to what I consider a fault in the physics model !The frustrations are :-1 (and this is the big 1) ) When accelerating out of a bend the car oversteers and crashes back into the bend it has come out of ! This is most noteable on raceroom raceway, on the corner at the start of the start finish straight. The track goes around a corner and up a hill, yet the car just uncontrolably spins with oversteer back towards the corner if power is applied.No amount of opposite lock corrects it, and it doesnt feel like the back end is trying to overtake the front end due to too much power. It feels like its turning in a circle for no good reason. Grrr !Though I have a feeling this is a common fault with a lot of so called sims. How many cars in the real world do you see spinning into the corner they have come out of ?This issue is probably more of a problem on raceroom raceway than most tracks. But that track in the standard yellow car (Canhard R52, sillhoutte series ?) sure does highlight it!Btw I have a g25 wheel and pedals and a fast pc (gtx970 etc). So I dont think my problems are down to my setup.Also I have witnessed many many drivers having the same problems on that track, so its not just me. Though the experienced drivers do work around the problem.2) If you do crash off, then the game takes 20 seconds to get going again. Either the car wont move at all or it just spins you into the opposite direction or you end up doing doughnuts. It will not spin and point in the right direction ! It doesnt matter if you are really subtle and gentle on the power or really heavy the result is the same ! Grrrr!I think other than this the physics are very good, the sound is very good, the graphics are a slight improvement over race 07, but not as good as say need for speed or project cars.Oh and I think the actual online multiplayer mechanics are good, which probably makes it one of the best online racing games, sim or otherwise on the pc (if and for me this might be too much of an if :- If you can adapt your driving style to ignore what I consider to be faulty physics).I like the way you can test drive the cars before buying, though generally the content is too expensive. Particularly buying multiple items doesnt give enough of a discount.Anyway, it would be a very good game, if it wasnt for what I consider to be a fault in one aspect of its physics model that makes it soooo frustrating :(",0
6930,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2016.0,"Still, after 9 years since game has been lounched it's one of the best mmorpg's ever made.

Yes, only with a few elder members, but still .. Graphics dont look like an high end title, but ye ... it still isn't trash.

1202,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI cannot believe how long I have been waiting and keeping an eye on this game. I've been waiting for a game that ticked my boxes, but sadly this isn't the one.The game looks good, has a huge map that's begging to be explored and I would've loved to explored it, combat is somewhat interesting and refreshing as well. Sadly this is all ruined by the fact that the Devs can't get a working game to peform correctly. The game has failed few times in the past, yet here we are. I got no clue of why they failed but what I do know is that if you fail, you learn from your mistakes. Here that doesn't seem to exist.Why bother throwing out packs that give customers access to the game 2 days early before official release date when the servers are wank, fps is shockingly poor and loading screen freezes??? Makes no sense at all. I honestly feel sorry for the game, fans and maybe devs but this isn't right. I'm thankful that Steam has refunded me my money as if they wouldn't, then this would've been a cashgrab.Not only that but a user made a thread regarding a duplication bug and it so happens to be the same one that existed in the previous versions of the game. I checked with Discord to see if this was true and one mod said that he or they were looking into it. Sounds like a yes to me.TL:DRDo yourself a favor and click  Not Interested  as this game is a complete mess. I cannot believe I paid for a game and couldn't get in to enjoy it.",0

14035,Magic Duels,2015.0,"To save writing and rewriting, or extending 'update reviews' for this game, let me just summarise how it goes over time:  Stainless releases a new update.  Things fall apart.  Bugs everywhere.  4-20 weeks later.  Mostly fixed.  MtG is such an amazing game, the few rare bugs left are nothing to worry about.And what can I say about it that is stable regardless: The gameplay is fantastic and it's endlessly replayable.   MtG is easily the best TCG around.  I've played scores and scores of TCGs and regularly play 5-6 particularly good ones, but MtG is in another league entirely.  And for Duels they carefully choose cards that make for a fun experience, with a nice balance between strategic and random factors, a bit like playing limited; but also give you tonnes of options for deckbuilding.  I currently have about 25 decks and none of them feel or play the same way - and I've seen plenty more both online and in the developer designed decks for AI play.It's challenging to unlock more cards without paying... but that actually brings with it a key part of what makes MtG what it is: because you have different cards from your friends, there's more variety and surprise when you play each other.Summary: If an update has just been released, wait a few weeks.  Otherwise - get it get it get it!",1

The game got over limited, you can only do 2 dungeons per day instead of 5 run PER dungeons at the beta. If you are a F2P player, you can't use some feature, example the party storage.3. You crash/Lag without reason due to the fact that the code is poorly optimized, one of the worst optimization that I've ever seen.4. You can't really trade see: https://treeofsavior.com/news/?n=356One of the reasons for these limitations is normally to prevent BOT, but this isn't effective at all, the only good point for IMC is to make you cash all month for an useless token for using all the feature of the game.Pro:1.

I bought a better flask at one point, and a new character, but I purchased both of these with the credits or whatever the currency was with what I got for free just by playing the game or by special event things.The gameplay is very fun, and it is quite relaxing, honestly, the just roam around and take over all the dungeons you see.

The reason smurfing in CS:GO isn't as bad as it could be is because of one thing. The price tag. Every single time you want to make a smurf account, you have to pay for another copy of the game. But with TF2, it's free. So all you need to do to make a smurf account is to make another account, download the game, and buy the cheapest thing off of the Mann Co. Store. Plus, the whole skill based matchmaking is a terrible concept. You could have played this game for over 5000 hours, and still be meh. You could then go into the game, and be matched with people who have played similar hours, but these people are amazing at the game. ""Oh, but to play competitive, you have to buy a ticket"" No, you actually don't. All you have to do is link your phone number to Steam, and you're ready to go.I started playing shortly before the MannConomy update, and it breaks my heart to not recommend TF2.

Platoons do have an overall effect on the outcome of a battle (An example of this: I was previously part of BWC, the general command of the platoon would always send us to the battles that we were losing or where we needed the territory and we would almost always succeed in changing the outcome of a battle.)6. Huge room for advancement in the game both for the developers, and as players. 7. Game for all ages and skill groups. Everyone can be used somewhere for something and be proven useful in that field.All-in-all, this game has been one of my most favorite games since I've started PC gaming. It is also one of the few games that I have been able to keep myself up all night playing. The game truly never gets old, theres always ways to advance.On a side-note, I have seen a few reviews saying that the game is pay-to-win. That is entirely no the case. Yes, you can pay for items in the game. But, all of those items are also obtainable through hours put into the game. No items are overpowered. The only factors into how well a player does is skill and knowledge of the game. And, of course, the occasional lucky play. But yes, the game is not pay-to-win. I have put money into the game, to obtain items that I simply did not feel like grinding for. Now, even with these items, people who have put no money into the game, had generic starting loadout, etc. Have killed me without issue. It simply depends on the player behind the keyboard.Of course, this game could improve in many ways. Like any other game, it has the occasional game-breaking glitch that is generally fixed immediately. Apart from that, there are generally very few issues within the game from what I have experience. 9/10",1
14498,Dungeon Defenders II,2017.0,"Immediately, it was unresponsive. Then, it took 12 or so attempts to actually access my tavern. Talking or interacting with anything causes the game to freeze temporarily. Server response is incredibly unacceptable. In-game purchasing is quite literally the worst model for a game, bringing the experience down to about a 5/10 on its own. With all the other problems, this game doesn't reach the scale at all. It's barely playable. And, I assure the reader, these are not problems with my system or network. This is clearly not a finished, or even decent, game.I'll stick to the first, actually working and enjoyable game.",0
18483,World of Warships,2018.0,I like that there is a friendly fire system in any game. This game is way over the top. People sail into your main gun fire. You get penalized. People ram you and you get penalized. People sail into your torpedos you get penalized. Other than the overwhelmingly stupid system it is an ok game. It has a few traps in it that force you to buy in game coin but its not terrible or good compared to others. Still though that dumb over the top friendly fire system I can't get past.,0
12279,Path of Exile,2018.0,"This game only works if you guys not have phones!In all seriousness, this game is dope, a megaton of content and completely free. It's complex and fun and instead of increasing number values on set items every few months like Blizzard does with Diablo III, they actually make new and engaging content and release them as a new league completely free to everyone to play. Sure you can enhance your experience with extra stash tabs or cosmetics if you want to, but you are never bared from any activity in the game because you didn't want to pay. I highly recommend Path of Exile for people who love deep and engaging Action RPG.",1
6388,Fishing Planet,2017.0,"As a casual player, the game has hit a point where it feels like it is aiming towards forcing you to pay real cash or quit.when you first start the game it all feels good but soon takes multiple turns in some ugly directions.You can't just sit there late game and think (oh yeah) ima sit back, relax, start off with a few perch, maybe enter a new map and go for some trout for a nice fight, or just roll out the cranks on some large mouth bass.You pay the pathetic amount of travel cost and licence fee for the day.Your forced to pay the advance licence to have access to the fish that are worth anything.Then you are forced to grind out the same fish species that offers the most cash so your not going to become bankrupt and end up back a noob lake.IMPORTANT: Don't make any plans for the day and if you have any plans cancel them.So you start to pull in some fish, not the fish you want to catch because this game just turned into a full time job.Everything starts off good then all of a sudden all the fish dissapear and no matter what bait you use or spots you try, everything that worked 10 minutes ago is now useless, bags almost full again anyway. lets skip time again so the fish show up... skip time.Nope, you can't skip time because they added a cooldown to it, 40 minutes left to wait... 20 minutes if i am a premium user, or i can skip time regarless for premium cash that i will never have because i only support game companies who do not enforce a pay or quit scheme.Maybe i should have gone for smaller fish, either way im on this map all day and night till i get my damn cash back and make atleast a little profit on this map. [15 minutes later]Sick of waiting Im done for the day.[The following day]Ok lets make this work..... [Something bites the fish are back yaaaay] Ohhh this ones a big one... wow 41lbs flathead catfish ima bag this one....... .. .... . .. . . . Noooooo fined, my licence ran out. Hello once again my noob lake friend.They call this game a simulation with pride, the fishing parts feels simulad at first but then starts to fall off in to an arcade grinder because of the pay to get anywhere features. The currency is definitely not simulating a real life experience, expect to pay huge prices through out the game and receive tiny amounts of cash in return because the currency in this game is about as far from simulation as you can get. If the game currency system was in our real world today, We would all be homeless in a week, but who cares about an empty home anyway, always grinding for that cheap tv that only costs around 178000 credits. 342000 if you add the travel cost.this game has potential to be one of the best game simulations out there but is ruined by greed and an unfair pricing system.",0

10909,Infestation: The New Z,2016.0,"*I have never heard of the New Z before it coming out on steam and tried it out for the first time yesterday*First off I want to say this game is free. Meaning there should be no reason for you to listen to reviews. You should play it and see if you like it or not.For a free game it's actually alright. There are no pay to win elements what so ever except being able to buy premium which is like unturned premium, yes you can buy meds and ammo for real life money, but you can also do so with ingame money which is easy to get. In my 3 hours I have well over 150 grand which is more than 20+ dollars can buy.This game is mainly pvp, with meds that have cool downs to use during fight, barricades to block off bullets, and a sweet arcade feel for combat that is not realistic at all.Killing zombies is quite rewarding as well and there is a skill gap in this game. You can find clans that go in together and run parts of the map on servers, so skilled gamers will enjoy this game.Remember this isn't a survival game but a shooter with zombies, where you find loot like meds, armor, guns, etc. and then go to pvp. That's the whole game. But it is fun to play and free. All negative reviewers are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid or are rating this way to harshly.Overall: 7/10 *Fun to play with friends every now and then and free*",1

13966,SMITE®,2016.0,"It's been over four years since I have stumbled onto this masterpiece of a MOBA. My review alone wouldn't do this game justice. The passion I have for the company Hi-Rez, the community, and the pro league is near and dear to my heart. The amount time I have sunk into this game is something I really don't want to know. From 3rd person action view and the 7 different gamemodes like conquest, arena, and MOTD (Match of the Day), to the 70+ playable gods that are still growing in numbers to this day and are all available under the god pack for $30 (best deal EVER). The game is updated every two weeks with incoming balance changes, new gods/goddesses, skins, and a lot more. From the variety of things like youtube, twitch, reddit, and gurus out there, the amount of content associated with this game is enormous. I highly recommend people who are intrested or are on the fence about the game to watch the new  Smite cinematic trailer  or  god reveal  for Amaterasu before jumping into a game of explosive enjoyment.I hope this helped some people out on making a decision and happy smiting!",1

1173,PlanetSide 2,2012.0,"TL;DRA unique experience, no other game does combined arms this well at this scale. Has a VERY steep learning curve, but it's definitely worth it.Still an absolutely breathtaking game, more than 5 years after release. I implore everyone to at least try this game! I owe some of my most amazing moments of gaming to PS2.Contrary to what many people say, this game is not remotely pay to win, at least in infantry combat. Your starting weapons are great, any weapon you can buy are side-grades. They affect your playstyle, but don't give you an advantage in every situation. There is a point to be made in vehicle combat though, as some (arguably) must-have weapons have to be unlocked, such as rocket pods. Luckily though, every weapon (except for the fancy decorated ones, which have no benefit over the regulars other than looking nice) can be unlocked with certs, this game's free currency.There's something here for everybody. Like tanks? Oh we got tanks alright. Like flying? Sure, you want a bomber, fighter or transport vehicle? More of a hit 'n run type? Try the Buggy or putting a grenade launcher on your quadbike! As for infanrty, the light assault allows you to scale walls, the infiltrator can cloak and snipe, the heavy assault has heavy hitting weapons and rocket launchers, it's all here.  You'll hear some people say there's no reason to play any other class than heavy assault, but this is simply not true. Yes, the heavy is capable of taking and dealing the most damage, but this is pretty much all they can do. If you learn to master the other classes, you'll be just as much of a threat. An infiltrator, for example, can sneak around the battle and start hitting the enemy from behind unseen. Take advantage of your turret near a chokepoint as an engineer! The possibilities are endless. However, it will take you a lot of time to figure out what the best option is in any given situation. Many players, however, are willing to help. Don't be afraid to ask questions about anything! Take note of what others are doing and try it yourself. If it's not working, that's not your playstyle, and you should switch.",1

It gets repeatitive, but this genre, grinders, is better this way, since you don't need to really push yourself, and enjoy the enviorenment, and actually just play with your muscle memory instead of brain. Yeah, here I said it, this game doesn't require brain, but still. It becomes addicting, but only if you understand this game as I explained. If you want a full MMO experience, I might say this game is not for you. It includes them, but lacks on a lot of it's aspects. It's like spinning a fidget spinner, doesn't make a lot of sense, you don't use your brain, but you have some kind of fun. If you like catching, growing and evolving monsters, this game is playable.

3978,Magic Duels,2015.0,"Magic the Gathering has become a free to play model this year, and I really tried to like this game. I liked the campaign and the challenge associated, deck building was neat, and having options to play after the campaign was over was nice. Now as I mentioned before, this game has switched to the free to play model, and the game is stacked heavily against you to pay real world money. These booster decks they want you to buy come 6 cards in a pack. Historically the Magic the Gathering video game series has been a cheap way to play Magic without having to physically own a deck, but last years and this years games have gotten very greedy. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time. If you are looking for decent Magic games I recommend anything before Magic 2015. I've played every Magic except for 2008 so I can tell that the video game series is steadily going downhill. I'd give this game a 4/10 and I'm being very optimistic.",0

But just cause after hundreds, if not thousands of hours of gameplay (I never really launched through Steam, so don't look at that) I walked away (cause everything wasn't going my way and my obsession with building a starbase had taken on sickening proportions) doesn't mean it's not a good game.My rule of thumb is generally that if you get at least 1 hour of fun out of a game for every 1 dollar you've spent on it, it's a good game.

I personally love leveling up, but i wish i can make some friends :(Okay, so what you need to know :This game is, of course, an MMORPG. You create your player with a selection of 12 classes. After you selected your character features, you have to choose your eidolon. Eidolons are basically partners that stay with you on your journey ( Pokemon-ish lol ). You begin the game in a dimensional belt or something. You fight your way to the boss. Somehow you end up in a small town next to the ocean. You have to complete some tasks for the people. After this, you move on to the next area, then the next and so on. The max level is 80 I believe, and once you reach over 70, your level turns into ??. I've been playing for a long time, and honestly, I love this game so much. If you would like to meet me in-game go ahead, but ofc you would have to be my friend, or if you already are, well you get the point. Okay well I hope this helped. And yes, I recommend this game DONT ASK ME QUESTIONS STEAM MY GOSH.......Sorry steam was asking me if i recommend this game.

I don't know if the AI ""cheats"" but I suspect so. I have been land starved after 4 lands in about 20% of my games using the decks given to me -- surely the AI is using similar compositions. Which leads to #2...(2) Get used to hitting the ""Restart Game"" in the Story Mode (to grind the currency a bit faster than head-to-head games). After completing the entire story mode including all the tutorials, I had enough currency to ... (WAIT FOR IT) ... buy six booster packs. The only thing sadder is that this is *significantly* faster than grinding in head-to-head games.(3) I have completed quests, seen the 40 gold checked and move towards my currency total, and then had no currency added. This happened to me most recently just a few minutes ago, and after wasting time creating a new deck to finish a quest, and then not being rewarded, I can safely not recommend this game to nearly anyone.I have played earlier Magic titles, and surprisingly... wait, no, *UN*surprisingly from this company, this is the worst one of them all.",0
19073,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI'm not going to give you a lengthy review but, bottom line is, if you love seeing hordes of monsters dying at your feet, a massive amount of loot (and the subsequent storage management), and if you're okay with a relatively short game with replay value amounting to building the same towers at the same location, then this game is for you.There's just a few maps at the moment, so i'm hoping they add more soon.",1

Somewhat canon rules, good olden card-os (think heartstone before GVG), and microtransactions (i get it, you need to earn something to stay afloat. But ONE deck slot and paywall to get more? REALLY?). For my taste it's meh. But if you never before tasted Yu-Gi-Oh!, don't want to get your hopes and dreams crushed by OTK/Exodia decks, and/or just looking to play some casual children's card game this might just be it for you.

If the developers ever read this: PLEASE! pretend you didn't make this game or have zero experience with a flight sim, hell just find some guy off the street and see how long it takes him to figure out how to fly with your current tutorials/videos. Based off that, you need to start over from the ground up. Explain EVERY step, how to perform it, and it's actual function in the simulation itself.

944,Champions Online,2014.0,"For  those  missing  the  hole  left  their  heart  by  the  departure  of  City  of  Heroes,  Champions  Online  can  help  fill  in  the  gap....a  little  bit.  In  many  ways,  the  game  has  a  much  different  feel  than  the  average  MMO,  such  as  a  need  to  be  more  precise  in  targetting.  While  ranged  characters  retain  auto-aim,  melee  is  more  about  actually  aiming  strikes.  The  character  creator,  though  more  limited  than  City  of  Heroes,  has  a  vastly  larger  number  of  customization  options  than  the  average  MMO,  as  opposed  to  some  popular  MMOs  like  DCUO  and  SWTOR.  The  game  has  major  short  comings  however  in  that  it  is  very  relient  upon  teaming  up  with  other  players,  and  some  difficulty  spikes  can  make  the  game  a  nightmare  to  try  and  play.  It  also  is  a  very  cartoony  and  comic  book  styled  MMO,  so  don't  expect  a  serious  story.  If  you're  look  to  fart  around  with  a  better  character  creator,  you  could  certainly  do  worse  than  Champions  Online.  But  if  you  really  want  to  play,  you're  better  off  waiting  for  City  of  Heroes  to  be  re-released  as  City  of  Titans  in  2015.",1

5804,WARMODE,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewRussian attempt at making basic counter strike clone. It is a bit unusual since it isnt p2w, but it misses core mechanics and anticheat. Menu is basically just a server list and a shop with real cash only skins. These have weird level requirement, but its easy to reach it. Skins go from 50 cents up to 3.5 dollars for the highest level skins. Skins look kind of decent even if they are same pattern reused a lot of times. Sadly they aren't in the steam inventory which makes them pretty much worthless, unless you really want to spend money on this game. There are also some hats and banners, which require payment as well.Game offers 4 different game modes: ""Deathmatch"" (team deathmatch), Confrontation, Sabotage (search and destroy/plant the bomb) and Zombiemode (pvp). I mostly found players playing deathmatch, there is very little of them left though.Now the interesting part, especially for a free to play game is that all the guns are bought and reset during the match. There is no inventory where you manage the guns in the lobby, annoying trial guns, p2w weapons or lucky boxes; instead you enter the match and gain 2000 points (depending on game mode) which you can use to buy some guns for start. The more kills you get, more money you gain progressively during the match which you can use to buy new weapons. These points of course reset for every match, so everyone gets a fair start.Gunplay felt lacking for me, the gunsounds were extremely bad, everyone was running around with knife trying to get some easy kills, since all it takes is one knife slice to get a kill. Running is just way too fast for game to be an enjoyable shooter. Most of guns have pretty horrible spread especially when moving, so you are forced to use ironsights which mostly block off your screen making it even harder to hit a target. Or you could try standing still trying to aim with crosshair while others are running to knife you and cheaters are noscope jumpshooting you.Warmode could've been at least a bit better casual shooter if it had any kind of anticheat and if devs didnt completely abandon it. Its only feature is that it isnt p2w, but thats about it. It held me for few minutes just so i could try out all the weapons.Pros:- Not pay to win- Weapons are bought with currency earned during match (works something like counter strike)- 4 game modes- Relatively decent looking cheap skins, available for direct purchaseCons:- No anticheat, cheater infested- Abandoned by developers- Small playerbase- Bad gunplay- Bad gun sounds- Small map pool- Running speed is too fast",0
14381,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,Drove my tank against a tree and my tank blew up.Update:The USA was literally made op by the devs. Rambos are all over every map and camp your spawn. Fighter pilots do the same exact thing.Summary: Still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ p2p game with♥♥♥♥♥♥devs that ruined this game.,0
20290,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game just can't get my recommendation. I'd leave it at neutral if I could. The game itself is fun. You got vehicles and explosions all about. I enjoy that it does retain some sense of realism to it. Here's why I'm neutral on it: The best teams to join in when you start off the game is American. If you start off as Soviet Union or Germany though, you will probably not see victories unless the opposing team has way less members than you, or until you reach the point of seeing automatic weapons on your team being used. When you join a match, you'll begin to realize that the Americans have fully automatic weapons and even vehicles with MGs on them. As for the Soviets? Well, we start off with semi automatic rifles and jeeps/trucks that serve no purpose other than transport. Why is this a problem? A lot of the starting battles take place at close range so the full auto guns have complete advantage over the Soviet Union. The armed vehicles actually suppress and deteriorate any advance made by Soviet Union. You could say ""Get skill"" but really, it wouldn't matter. You can be extremely skilled and yet, be so limited due to the crappy Soviet loadout. It seems you would actually need to PAY to win as the Soviets. So unless I begin to see the starter battles look less biased towards Americans, my opinion won't change.",0
6844,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,"Want to drown yourself and boobs and moaning sounds?

So good that's the only thing bad about it!I've spent 25 minutes on this game, and wish I could've spent more time on it. However the only thing that stopped me from playing more of Sakura Clicker is the sudden realization that I sadly had a life that I need to attend to instead of watching clones in skimpy clothing moan as I move my finger up and down the left mouse button. At least my friends know that I played this game and that I seem to have no life.I (don't) recommend this for sole reason that it (sadly) exists and that every game should be (not) like this.I have committed a sin, and that sin was to play this game, let alone install it.

8197,Brawlhalla,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewBrawlhalla is similar to games like Super Smash Bros, Awesomenauts, Etc.The overall concept of the game is excellent.  It removes a little of the casual feel of other games in it's genre, and I believe it will appeal to more technical gamers.The characters are all available to play right now while it is in beta, but they will be purchasable with in-game earned gold upon release (I believe), similar to the way you'd buy champions in LoL, Dirty Bomb, and loads of other free to play games.The characters themselves are pretty cool.  The art style is simple, effective, and in my opinion, beautiful.  Each one has a unique moveset and has 2 weapon pick-ups available for it.  The attacks feel clean and the hitboxes make sense, the dodge cooldown seems perfect to me and longer, skilled fights will make you break out in a sweat.  A few awesome modes, slight character customization, and a very solid 1v1 ranked system are all just toppings on an already delicious cake.10/10 definitely recommend for any brawler fan.",1

111,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewTL;DR is at the bottom (I don't blame you for not wanting to read this for how long it is)This game is very unbalanced, you can have nothing but the starter gun, the starter gun being a semi-automatic rifle while other people are driving around in tanks. To get a tank you have to get to rank 5, to level up it takes about 20 hours, and not to mention the fact that you have to fork over 40,000 credits to switch to the armored divison and get a tank with no actual cannon, just an LMG and the thinnest armor imaginable.          When someone is in a tank and you don't have a rocket launcher there is literally nothing you can do about it unless they poke their head out the top to look around, and that's hoping that you don't get sniped first (snipers are VERY overpowered because they one shot you no matter where you get hit and take forever to get unless you pay or have 100,000 credits and get the required medals. And after that you have to use it without a scope until you unlock it, and it's the last thing you unlock and costs an arm and a leg to buy.) And not to mention the slow progression in this game that becomes very frustrating becuase of one-hit snipers, tanks and having to REPAIR guns and vehicles with credits, if they reach 0% you can't use them. The only time the game is somewhat fun, is when there arn't many tanks and snipers or if you a tank or a sniper or if you have a good tank or sniper.    But the devs have added one mode that doesn't allow tanks, and for it there is one map with one objective in one building, but that might be worse because to go in it means that you walk into a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of grenades. Let me also talk about the fact that this game is not skill based at all, if you have the starter gun you will get destroyed by everyone (by everyone I mean the people that have paid because everyone else has gotton bored and given up) and everyone that has paid has an automatic weapon, if you have the starter gun and you're going up against someone with an auto you will get destroyed simply by fire rate because every gun in the game has the same damage, and becase that person has an auto they fire 30x faster than you, killing you almost instantly. This game is not worth downloading, it's not even worth the store page that it has IMOTLDR:Tanks and snipers are VERY overpowered and take forever to get, making progression frustrating. Automatic weapons are also OP becuase every gun in the game does the same amount of damage meaing that an AR does the same damage as your rifle, but the AR shoots 30x faster. It also takes about 50-100 hours to get because it's almost the last thing you unlock.  3/10 Terrible5/10 if you have good tank, sniper or AR",0

20301,Elsword,2014.0,"This game is extremely fun when you play with friends or a guild. However most people quit right away for specific reasons. One of the reasons is not liking the character/class you chose. In order to fully enjoy this game you have to find the character/characters that suits your playing style. Then decide if you want to PVP or PVE or both. At the higher levels of this game it could seem a little bit grindy since you have to repeat dungeons alot. As far as cash shop goes, it's really expensive however, through patience and participating in events you could honestly avoid spending too much money.There's only one thing you have to buy if you go that route. You have to buy a B slot so you can use your other skills. Elsword is quite enjoyable but you have to give it a real try before discrediting it.Negatives are:-Half the population doesn't speak english and half the ones who do are immature kids.-Costumes and mounts and decent gear are extremely expensive and game is cash shop drawn, expected though.-Grindier at the higher levels-Not newbie friendly, especially when it comes to terms with skill points and stuff. Since you have to figure out your playing style and what skills you prefer. Guides are nice but everyone has a preference.-Events can seem a bit lame and generic at times.Positives are:-Fast paced side scrolling action. It's not a point-and-click game. It's also not too heavily gear based as it is skill based.-Every boss is different and unique.-New content continously-When you do find those special friends, it's totally fun running dungeons, taking screenshots for events, goofing off in the town squares, and showing off your pets and costumes and mounts!-Getting in-game currency isn't hard at all. El shards are always profitable as well as boss drops and your ED from dungeon runs.-Pvp is pretty fun with friends, solo match making is for all the try hards who have something to prove online so I would avoid that because they are usually hardcore and rage alot.-My favorite reason for playing Elsword is my friends, so the best idea is to find good ones!As for typical ratings here they are!4/5 For gameplay4/5 For content [We usually always get new content but it takes a bit longer on NA server]2/5 For community [Good friends are a jewel and people always come and go]1/5 For affordability [Cash shop super over priced]5/5 For customization [Tons of different [cool, cute, and intimidating] pets and even rare ones from events. and characters are pretty unique considering they have 3 different classes which change their stance, pose, and voice not to mention costumes!

7581,Fishing Planet,2018.0,"Product received for freeSee my play hours? Not that much really. I already am LVL 24-25 (which is halfway through) with 5 (all the best I could buy at my current LVL) rods/reels and plenty of baits, lines, lures, the biggest/best keeptnet/equipment for my current LVL, and free money to make trips. If you need in-game money just go fish some Bass in Texas, that's the biggest grind there is. Use your Baitcoins for Unlimited Basic Licenses, and use money for travel and special Advanced License fishing trips (for trophy fishing). That simple. I also didn't put 1 dime into this game. My biggest complaints are the hands/arms model being male even if you choose a female, and broken character shadow animation (which I didn't verify is still un-fixed as of late), which should be easy to fix and they let it be. Probably because most people don't mind.They also just updated the game with some Training Tutorials/Challenges with rewards on top, which is a step in a good direction (the updated UI is neat too). So yeah, I've seen way worst F2P games out there.So in short, you can perfectly enjoy this game without putting any money in it as a non-competitive player. Maybe even as a competitive one, I haven't tried. But it would make sense that you need to put at least a bit of money to compete against top players in advanced tournaments.Want to see an horrible F2P fishing game? Try Russian Fishing 4 and see for yourself. Don't mind my review of it, which is mostly only about how the devs and mods are trash. The game itself is the definition of a real grind fest. Try and see for yourself if you have the free time and bandwith to spare, and compare it with Fishing Planet. Also as a bonus for anyone reading, if you really want a P2P (you buy, you own it all forever) fishing game, try Ultimate Fishing Simulator. Only around 18$, just out of Early Access, and seems to be really good for what it is.Will probably buy it around this Christmas. Just avoid RF4 LOL (if you value your free time that is), I hate these guys. I hate crooks.",1

16903,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI will be the first to say this game had issues, but the speed at which things are being fixed is outstanding. Less then one week into release and most of the problems are nonexistant.  The constant ballences and optimizations that keep rolling in put this game and dev team far above the rest. The constant communication from the dev team , and improvements that keep coming it are what make this game the best. I would ignore all the negitive trash posts and form your own opnions. Launch was rocky, but what these guys have done so far, and continue to do for the future of bless online is amazing. I have played lots of launches, and it took these guys almost no time to fix issues that ususally take productors months to fix. Im sitting at almost 200hours of game play. And have been in the game since launch(28th)",1

You can be Human, Klingon, and Romulan. They also just added character and game options to make a character during the time of the Original Series. You can personalize your starship and characters in so many different ways. They have ships from all series, all races (Dunno about Ferengi though). My game of the year! (And that's saying a lot considering I play Console games.) You can also do what many trekkies dream of in a game. EXPLORE!  Borg: You will play this game. Resistence is Futile.

Honestly, I can't stand this game, it's so clunky, hit detection is awful, too many shotgun users, terrible render distances. Too much emphasis on crates and skins, feels like the devs only care about microtransactions rather than improving the game.This game almost turned me off completely of Battle Royals type games. I was urged to get PUBG by a bunch of friends, when I finally gave in I was hooked. PUBG is 1000x better than this game. I already have almost twice the amount of time played in PUBG than this game, and I've owned King of The Kill since it and Just Survive were one single game.

19659,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"I personally have mixed opinions about the game.  1. Lack of unique customization - No hair color, limited choices on hair styles, no skin color, as far as I can tell your class determines your looks unless you purchase an outfit, armor doesn't change the look of your character so everyone loks the same other than class.2. Limitations - Starting the game I am going around grinding and grinding and grinding just to try to make a little silver cause you can't buy or sell on the marketplace for three days, you can't trade for three days, you can't do anything that's not relative to you vs. NPC.  It's too limited and I can't stand being limited.3. There is no option to purchase in game currency for Premium, another fail.If you're going to open up the game via Steam have everything ready... and don't limit the users willing to purchase your product and play your game... just the way I think.The game play is okay, lags a bit, but other than that it's okay I suppose, i've put a good bit of time into it and have a lot more to see.",0

At everyone who would compare NewZ to any other Infestation game I'd simply tell you that you can't. Game is unique, devs are active, anticheat is ultra decent, and community can be friendly at some points.I'm the first one pointing out some default of the game, and the fact it can be boring if you play the same things over and over again, but there is multiple game modes and a lot of things to do to avoid getting it becoming boring.The only thing I can say is go to chill around some streams, youtube videos or even on the forum and you will clearly want to test the game.Oh yeah I was going to forget but support is really active too and it's enjoyable.",1
15509,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2017.0,"With likely over 3000 hours into the game, only about 850 of which I have logged on Steam thanks to playing it without and playing in offline mode, LotRO has been the epicentre of my MMORPG experience for nearly a decade, and I believe there it will firmly remain as long as the game is alive. There as a lot that Turbine has done correctly and well with this game since its conception, and very little that they've done bad that really could take away from the experience. As the game now stands with the same developers under a new studio, hopefully with greater freedom and budget to do as they like, I have nothing but a bright and shiny outlook for the future of the game. The community is one of the most friendly and positive I've known, and community-run events are plenty in addition to the seasonal dev-run events. 10/10 ~ I will continue to ~always~ recommend it to others to at least give it a shot.

8020,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,Great F2P game.I have had alot of fun playing this game over the years. I believe I first played on xbox when The Orange Box came out. That was stolen before I could really enjoy much since I was moving and someone broke into my storage. I started playing on Steam once I got back into playing PC games and saw it was f2p. I did end up getting a copy of The Orange Box on here which made trading in-game items available as well as selling the market for some things.I really enjoy the big events like Halloween and how they have special maps and items every year. The last few years new event items have not been tradable which kind of sucks since they were lots of fun for trading and selling to get cooler things or things you couldn't seem to get no matter how much you played.I definitely recommend playing and buying something cheap in-game to unlock trading and selling items.The game is like a cartoonish Counter-Strike and so much fun is to be had especially with friends and good strangers.,1

I think the layout and the concept is nice but can get kinda boring after a while. The first hour its kinda fun but then until u can build the overseers office it just a grind. As fast as u get the overseers office the game gets much more fun and interesting. Just give itn some time!I recommend this game and why not try it I mean its free so give it a go!

With that said, I jumped in, learned from there - it was successful. :)Absolutely recommend the title, even now in alpha. Community tends to be more mature and helpful than in your average MOBA title, too.

But in order to get the dark brotherhood and madhouse cards, you need 4,500 gold in chunks of at least 1,000, so if you grind in the arena, the rate at which you'll acumulate the gold for those cards will be hampered so much that you won't be getting any of them for a very long time.",0

17959,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"Game started decent with an nice tutorial and Solo-/Storymissions.Shadowverse is a Mobile App transported to Steam and has a also a decent production value. The Arenas are 3D Animated which kind off has a low resolution (because it is made for Smartphones) but every Arena has an nice introduction and its own distinguishable soundtracks.At first I thought nice little card game. But at a second look it is basically an Hearthstone clone to the core. And Hearthstone is in my personal opinion not a good card game and Shadowverse is worse because it kinda trivialize its own mechanics.Each class has also in Shadowverse it's own little mechanic but only for it's specific cardset for anything else it has ""Evolution"" which basically grants an Unit under your controll an stat boost and sometimes some special effects.And that's it.I am currently stuck at the end of the Rowen Campaign where i play against a copy of my own deck and i can't beat it. I personally think the reason is not because unlucky play or pure incompetence but because the AI seems to know what i have on my hand has always the perfect card set to counter it.So i am currently under the impression the AI is cheating to win the game. Which feels kinda disheartening. Especially if as i tried to counter this effect by let the AI run out of cards only for the moment that the AI plays a couple of cards to replenish its hand.At this point I would have re-arranged my Deck to prove my thesis further and to get an advantage, especially as the Storymission told me that I won a few cards for the specific class and should add it to the deck but there is no option to do it. Which mean i am stuck with a Deck which can't defeat the AI.I personally will try it again. But at the current state the game consists out of the same♥♥♥♥♥♥Hearthstone consists off: Bash cards around until someone run out of cards or you have an opening and kill your opponent, which is not a very tactical game in my opinion and is way faster over than hearthstone because of the Evolution mechanic which buffs the Units and the fact you have only 20 Hitpoints.Another plus i give the game are the rewards. As a fresh starter i got a bunch of free card packs, tickets, vials (which is basically the magic dust from hearthstone) and a ton of gold.",0
297,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis should be a good game, and by all rights it is. The gameplay is fun and the robot design mode usually works properly but there a few major problems worth mention.There are a number of methods to get under the map and once there its a simple matter to wipe out the enemy team. EVERY ice map has somewhere to get underneath and its extremely frustrating to get destroyed and have the kill cam show the cheater sitting under the game on a huge sheet of ice that streaches the entire map.The simple fix for this would be a kill-zone that streaches underneath, insureing that when a cheater manages to get underground it would destroy them and respawn. On a plus side I've only seen this on the ice maps.Some game modes have come and gone, and while they were kind of nifty the game has changed to be more focused in thier absence. However what was unacceptable was the removal of Megabots. The game has Microtrasactions, and to support the game I was having fun playing I purchased multiple Megabots with US Dollars. A recent patch removed the Megabots and gave NOTHING back.The replaced 'Power Booster' does nothing (Well, ok full energy recharge takes 8 seconds instead of 10 seconds but you'd never notice unless you took it to the test zone with a stop watch) so its not in any way helpful. The mega weapons take FAR too many flops to be placed on a regular bot since if you do it'll take 600/1515 PFLOPS and then you still need a method of movement and chassis.I requested a refund for the 10 mega guns and 4 wheels and 3 hovers I bought with USD. After spending $40+ worth of GC they returned... $2.50. Unacceptable. They let you return the mega parts back for the full RP (Nonpremium currency) but you can't return them for GC and all of the cool vanity items are GC only. I submitted a ticket about it, but I'm not sure if it was anwsered because I have no idea where thier anwser would GO for me to read it. I don't even want the money back I just want my GC, and I think its reasonable that if I bought them with GC I should get refunded GC.TL/DROdd glitches in Robot Builder, a number of cheaters, and be careful what you spend you money on but otherwise awsome game with active devs. Worth playing but don't spend money in here until those issues are fixed.",0

I am currently MG1, and it was a long road to get there. I had the troubles, of when I got on a large win streak, I would be on a game I was certain I would rank up, then of course a hacker would have to be on the other team. All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs. There is a small chance of winning when against a smurf, and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank. If you can get games with no smurfs, derankers or hackers, this game is amazing and I enjoy everything about it other than what was just mentioned. I give it a 8/10.",1
7861,SMITE®,2016.0,"lets start with the basics:okay, so.. the game is similar to the very popular game called League of Legends.. well, but since i dont really like, i mean i hate League of Legends, i didnt really plan to play with this game, either... because i heard that its very similar to that game and you know since i dont like that game, why would i like this one?after i played it, it turned out that its much better, i repeat much BETTER than League of Legends.. because in League of Legends, you get to play as like a strategy game, camera position from above, clicking to move etc. and i dont really like strategy games either, but there are some that i liked a bit, for example Red Alert, but thats different.. also this game is played in third person mode, you can play with a lot of good characters, but here they are called ""gods"".. because actually some of them (that i know) are really gods that has been confirmed by people in the old ages, who knows when... and so yes, the game is really similar to League of Legends, but as i said, its much betterthe game has got a quite good graphics, it has a good fighting system, it has a fair money system, because here there is no ""pay to win""! there is only ""pay to skin"" maybe, that you can get because skins are the things for the gods that you can get by paying for the game or by collecting gems or at some skins favors (that is used for the money itself in the game anyway)or there could be pay to win, if someone pays a lot for the game just to get all the gods, its even possible to do it on low level by paying for the game ^^""there are different type of classes like in any MMORP games, you know like those common classes like warrior, assassin, mage etc.whatever anyone says, if you get to learn to use a specific class or a character, then you can play well with that, but it depends on you, for example i cant really play with the class mage, but theres a mage character (like as i said a specific character sometimes) that i can use wellso i think if you would like to get to know or to try this game, i really recommend you this one :)anyway, this game is really based on teamwork, so the team has really gotta work together well to succeed, otherwise.. if you solo, if you like go alone and try to do everything on your own, you will failunfortunately, sometimes there are hackers, but you can report themp.s.: you can play with bots as well, theres a tutorial in the game, you can practice etc.",1

3351,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Review2017 Update:Tried Robocraft out again for a few hours. To see where progress has been made or lost.As predicted, most changes are made due to the dwindling playerbase. This explains why in the past they removed barriers to matchmaking like Tier Divisions, Level affected matching, reducing the amount of players per team etc.I joined now to find that they've further made changes that exacerbate imbalanced matches by removing level requirement to unlock CPU, giving everyone the same CPU allotment at maximum and allowing bots of any CPU mixture to play together. It simply totals up the CPU on a team and makes it match up on the other team. The problem with this is, it inevitably ends up where you'll have one team with CPU evenly spread among them ranging from 1.4k to the maximum and the other team will be full of scouts with a single person at maximum cpu.The game still suffers mobmentality wipeouts and favors it to be played as so. As much as there are cries of tactics are valid, nothing still beats team rushing.Sadly though, these changes have done nothing to help new players, against old hats like myself and even older hats who understand Triforcing and damage mitigation, which is near gone, most resorting to either sheer bricks upon bricks or mobility evasion (read; drones). Only played a dozen matches today, lost one and thats because I decided to use a stupid bot you'd expect a noob to (one megaleg, rocket launcher, shield gen, thats it.) and even then, it was a close loss.The ultimate kick to the teeth though, is the changes to the Battle Arena mode, specifically, the ""Imbalance Detected"" system, where it will cause Protonium to spawn on the map. If the enemy destroy it, they instantly equal the progress the winning team has made.All this serves to do is infuriate the winning team and delay the match even further, as the losing team may have now equalised, but is still on a losing footing control point wise. If the losing team choose to ignore the Protonium and focus on the control points, again.. theyre still on a losing footing.As it stands Robocraft has an average weekly player base of 3,000 spiking 6,000. In 2014 it was 14,000 spiking 25,000. Lets see how you fare in 2018 Freejam. If youre even still around.2016 Update: FJ are now trying to censor negative reviews as ""abusive"" even if they are not.https://twitter.com/TomCat__86/status/746665833414332420I give up with Robocraft.TLDR; Robocraft devs don't know what they want their game to be. They've tried DM/TDM, E-Sports, Creative Building, MOBA, Player Choice Progression, Forced progression, bland progression. Each and every update drastically changing how the game plays and nullifying ANY work players have put in to creating their bots.They establish one set of rules only to change them a few months down the line under the guise of ""Balancing"" or enabling ""player creativity"" and doing the complete opposite.Not to mention the game has flaws from years ago still not fixed and now being hidden by new changes. For example MM being broken turning it into ""Who has the most medics, wins""and hiding the poor matchmaking by removing robot classification ""because not all bots were classified correctly"" (translation, 1 in maybe 100 were wrong, and ""its haaaard."")Edit to include the latest update (Max Loadout) - Again FJ don't understand normal development practices. They threw in MASSIVE changes all at once and are no sat scratching their heads wondering why it broke. Flak is bugged (DMG), Nano is bugged (LMB+RMB = superspeed heal), MSMGs are bugged (free aim firing, without LOS), matchmaking is atrocious (still), Blink and DSM are stupidly expensive (Both RP/GC and CPU). They should have done a slow implement of these changes one by one to iron each minor kink, instead of this.-------------------------------Too many wild changes, one step forward two steps back is this developers motto.Robocraft initially had a sensible mixture of Creativity and Function. There was also a sensible mix of Grind, Progression and sense of achievement. It was a little lacklustre in places. For example, the RP system allowed you to choose what you unlocked and the level system determined how ""effective"" those unlocks were. As you progressed in Level and CPU, your bots got bigger, your weapons better.This has now been swapped out for a system where equipment is unlocked in order, over time with no player input. Once you unlock an item, that is it, theres no improvement. Everything is by default ""Tier 10"".This in turn made building robots boring, no more balancing weaponry vs armor vs mobility. If you chose to go cosmetic-bot there was a challenge to making a bot functional but in ""theme"".Now sure you can build a bot ""exactly"" as you want, as long as you like Yellow, Pink, White, Grey & Brown as your color palette. The other colours are locked to premium (Note they touted this ""flattening"" of tiers as an 'improvement' to creative robot building).Then theres the slew of problems with actual Gameplay mechanics.Initially there were balancing issues as expected, they kind of balanced themselves out up until Unleashed/Legendary update and the devs got stuck in a nerf cycle on everything except SMGs.This last update saw them add the near useless flak, severely nerf the Medics Nano and turned it into SMGcraft again.They also did away with many of the useful gameplay information elements.Spotting now just says ""Enemy Spotted"" with no indication of flier, hover, walker, they claimed this is because bots were ""complicated to classify"" yet for the most they were classified correctly. This means you find it far harder to prioritise the right targets.This also affects your own team negatively as you can no longer easily see if a friendly medic is nearby or if a push block is Rail Heavy and needs more SMG or plasma.The game has also suffered Match making issues from day one. Resulting in differing metas.The latest of which is ""The Team who has the most medics, wins"". The hiding of Bot Type and spotting call outs I think was done to merely hide how bad the matchmaking is, especially as in the past when we could see the team makeups we would see matches where it was 6 rails and two plasmas vs say 6 SMGs and two medics.Put simple, the devs have taken this game in far too many directions, too rapidly and with no forethought.Initially it was a DM/TDM game, then they opened it up to the Creative Block Builders, then expanded to Boss Battles (removed, was one Megabot vs lots of little bots quite fun), then switching to try their hand at MOBA-like Tower matches, then trying to create some kind of bespoke ""Robot Market"" where players can sell their bots, but their currency system is too expensive to support.Its like they saw all these good ideas from other games and tried to cram it into their own, trying to snap up a bit of another niche in gaming and half assing it so badly that it introduces more problems than it gains in players.This is likely the reason why they ""flattened"" their game down to basic progression.",0

It really is very nice and very immersive.Buying 1 pack from stream and then later much cheaper now when I buy ingame store. I guess a big part of that is content I now already own from buying that first pack, so in the end prices are really not too bad.I am enjoying driving at Nordschleife with this sim much more than I ever did with either AC or Pcars.The combination of great sound, graphics, forcefeedback and overall feel really puts you in the driving mood.

12920,Bless Online,2018.0,"Waited for this game for 6 years since it was first previewed and couldn't wait for it.  Tried it in Russia, Korean Rebuild, and Japan.  All of these versions were better despite the optimization issues and slow combat (Japanese version was actually ok in the combat, just needed a slight increase in speed).  Then came the NA version.  Cheats were everywhere and dupes still existed from previous versions/regions that were known about for years.  Optimization was still never fixed.  Cheaters/dupers received slaps on the wrist.  Absurd gear time releases made the factions imbalanced quickly.  Server merges made it even worse despite the company knowing that it would be this way.The people representing the company in the discord were terrible (childish, dismissive to legitimate complaints about not only the game but other staff members, rules not enforced ie person would be kicked after 5 minutes of voicing concern over the game yet someone with a racist slur in their name was brought up to every single staff member and it took 5 hours before someone would do anything about it after bringing it up a second time).  Overall a terrible experience in game and interaction with the company in the discord.  I had minor issues with optimization, but dealt with it for awhile.  Finally decided that they weren't going to fix any legitimate complaints and that this version was going to suffer the same fate as all of the other regions: any new version that came out would get the spotlight and the previous ones would be forgotten about.  This version is about to get the same treatment because of the xbox1 version that's in the works.",0

They never asked me for a credit card, I never spent anything.

715,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"I'd like to give this a neutral review but since that's not an option, i'll give a slight recommendation.first, i'd like to address the elephant in the room. this game was originally developed for tablet, which, as you should know, means that if you expect a real game, you're gonna be disappointed. if you want a real game that you can play for at least two to five hours without taking a break or getting bored, you may wanna take a look at Sheltered or something similar. generally, it's a good idea to stay away from f2p or tablet games if you want a real game. also, obviously, the controls are mediocre at best and annoying at worst, it really shows that it wasn't originally designed for pc.ok, now that that's out of the way, let's get to the actual review part. the core gameplay mechanics seem pretty generic, as it can be expected from a f2p game. that's not really a bad thing though since it's basically a waiting game which means it is expected to deal with pretty basic mechanics. click on things to collect resources and items, click on people to let them level up, and so on. if you want to loose, you have to try very hard (if it's even possible to let everyone in your vault die, unless you play on survival), if you want to ""win"" you have to spend money or play for a very long time (what i mean by ""winning"" is having built everything that you want to build). nothing new.the game will continue to run if you are logged out, and obviously while you're not online, you won't be able to collect anything. that is also not really bad though because after a short while, the resource consumption will be halted. so you will have a little less resources when you log back in but they won't be completely depleted.generally, if you don't want to spend money on it, it seems to be a good idea to just log in every couple of hours, collect everything, send some people on quests, start a new weapon/armor production, maybe use speed-mode a couple of times to get a few caps and fill your resource-storage faster and once everything seems good, you can log out again. just don't forget to check your statistics-screen every once in a while, to make sure that your production per minute is still higher than your consumption per minute.also, there are a couple bugs, crashes and other issues. if you decide to play this game, maybe you have already played some early access titles where the developers simply stopped to care and never fixed any bugs or anything? this game will remind you of that. there is absolutely no communication from the developer, certain bugs have been known for years but no one cared enough to fix them. after a simple look at the discussions you will also probably find that you shouldn't get too attatched to your vault and definitely shouldn't spend any money on it. almost every day i looked, there has been at least one thread on front page complaining about the game being unplayable due to crashes/freezes/etc or the save file being corrupted/disappeared. so it definitely is a bit of a gamble.if everything works and you are lucky enough to not run into any game breaking bugs it can be fun but that is definitely not guaranteed. so if you like waiting games you can definitely give it a try but i would strongly suggest to not support the developer by buying anything in this game until they start to care a little bit more and fix bugs and other problems.",0

7427,Black Squad,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewOddly enough, this game has helped me, a console player, transition from controller to m/k. The netcode on this game is absolutely fantastic. In just over 20 hours of playtime, I've not once felt like I've been cheated by lame hit detection or dsync issues. As someone who needs all of their shots to count, this was a huge selling point for me. Personally, I enjoy the dedicated spawns as it gives me an idea of where the enemy will be coming from. You can still flank and outmaneuver, but for the most part, it comes down to who has the best aim. No P2W here, as all guns can be purchased for either gold or medals. Both of which can be earned just by playing the game. You can buy weapons outright for real money, but from what I have seen, there is no gamebreaking weapon in the game. However, if you feel like there is a weapon that is constantly killing you and you currently don't have the means to purchase said weapon, you can download the 15 day DLC weapon packs for free and try out each gun, helping you to see which gun you should spend money on next. I mainly play TDM, and have noticed the maps to be quite small with multiple maps being set up like a paintball course (one room with obstacles spread throughout). Overall, I would say to give this game a try. I've never played CSGO, but this has got my interest up.",1
1823,Dungeon Defenders II,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewLet me state that I honestly want to reccomend this game, Trendy is SO good in listening to their playerbase and making changes, not to mention they're constantly updating and upgrading the game to make it more interesting and varied for those who want to. Not to mention Trendy's amazing P.R. I LOVED Dungeon Defenders 1, I was SO damn hyped for Dungeon Defenders 2, and back when it was first released as free-to-play (there was a period where they had a pay-only version with special skins and such) I jumped on it and liked it a lot. I  stopped playing for a while because of other games *cough diablo3andoverwatch cough* I got back into it for a while, with the new heroes who are both unique and interesting. For a while everything was hunky dory, I was steadily increasing the difficulty with which I could gather my loot. (side note: at first it was really difficult to break into the nightmare levels without someone to carry you)The campaign is pretty short but you wont spend a lot of time playing that because the real meat is in the other game modes. The story is also quite lackluster, doesn't really go anywhere. Then the trials update came along and all of the sudden I had no clue what the truck was going on, the new systems were poorly explained and I didn't really get any help by anyone because the population was all focused on the new end-game, I have tried since then to get back, but the amount of shazz goin on is overwhelming and I just end up not playing.For Fans of Dungeon Defenders 1, wanting a similar game with similar simple systems...look away.If you like ARPGs and Like Tower Defence games? this game is so up your alley it would be insane for you to not play it. just be aware of the giant skill-wall.

17945,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2018.0,"The Six Steps of CheesemakingAcidification: Starter culture is added to milk to change lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid. This process changes the acidity level of the milk and begins the process of turning milk from a liquid into a solid.Coagulation: Rennet is added to further encourage the milk to solidify.Curds and Whey: Curds are cut using a knife or a tool that resembles a rake. Cutting the curds further encourages them to expel liquid or whey. Generally, the smaller the curds are cut, the harder the resulting cheese will be. Soft cheeses like Camembert or Brie are hardly cut at all. Harder cheeses like Cheddar and Gruyere are cut into a very fine texture. For these harder cheeses, the curds are further manipulated by cheddaring and/or cooking. Cooking the curd changes its texture, making it tender rather than crumbly.Salting: Salt adds flavor and also acts as a preservative so the cheese does not spoil during long months or years of aging also helps a natural rind to form on the cheese. There are several ways to use salt. Salt can be added directly into the curd as the cheese is being made. The outside of the wheel of cheese can be rubbed with salt or with a damp cloth that has been soaked in brine. The cheese can also be bathed directly in vat of brine.Shaping: The cheese is put into a basket or a mold to form it into a specific shape. During this process, the cheese is also pressed with weights or a machine to expel any remaining liquid.Ripening: Referred to as affinage, this process ages cheese until it reaches optimal ripeness. During this process, the temperature and humidity of the cave or room where the cheese ages is closely monitored. An experienced affineur knows how to properly treat each cheese so it develops the proper flavor and texture. For some cheeses, ambient molds in the air give the cheese a distinct flavor. For others, mold is introduced by spraying it on the cheese (brie) or injecting it into the cheese (blue cheese). Some cheeses must be turned, some must be brushed with oil, and some must be washed with brine or alcohol.",1

19469,SMITE®,2018.0,"They cannot balance this game correctly to save their lives, crazy unbalance across gods, items being buffed and nerfed every patch but never even balanced, therefore not only changing the meta every two weeks and forcing people to constantly have to learn♥♥♥♥♥♥that will only be changed the following two weeks but also just not allowing any chance for routine or just enough time for a proper meta to be established. As a whole the annoying things are poor mechanics. I just completed a game where I was playing Arachne and I had used my ultimate. Whilst in this ability I am supposed to be immune to all damage, mind you this was mid way through the ability, not in the charge up. During this so called immune ultimate, I was killed by another Arachne, therefore cancelling the whole principle of my ultimate ability. One of the few multiple occasions where this game has just not worked well. Look, it is a great game and I have spent a large majority of time on it, something always makes me come back, but for players like me, being around in the community for such a long time (since beta on other accounts), it frustrates me how little I get in returrn for my playing hours, there is no way that I, as a long time player, get rewarded for my loyalty. I still get terrible matchmaking, an abundance of bugs and just a series of unfun games where I'm stuck in a rut, not getting matched with people even close to my level. I literally get matched with first time conquest players when I have 1000+ games under my belt. This is not me gloating, this is just five seasons of built up overall distaste of a lack of passion by the creators. It doesn't help that every new player thinks they are god's gift and doesn't listen to or even accept someone trying to help them learn the game. It's an absolute shambles but I've never complained before and I feel as a dedicated member in the community I should have my fair say. Also OCE has no ranked scene. Peace.",1

5165,Magic Duels,2016.0,"I Thought that things thats have been repeated for 4 years now should be better than the older ones since Stainless have thad time to practice but for some reason this one is somehow the worst.For the single player campaign: It's very very bad. Your deck from the start is absolute garbage and half the cards you get aren't even playable in your own deck. Your campaign deck is updated everytime but they don't tell you which crads have been replaced and which cards have been added, you can't see the deck you play you just have to rely on chance I guess.After the single player(wait was that it, so short) you can play the onlkine mode(if it doesnt crash every single time). They brought back two-headed giant thats for some reason doesnt award quests and where you can't communicate with your own teammate for some reason and you can't tell if your teammate has dropped and been replaced by AI, since you CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH THEM.(seriously wtf). The time it takes for you to build up some sort of reasonable card collection is just bad, the quest give wayy too little gold, the packs cost too much and the packs only have 6 cards. IRL magic packs contain 15 cards and while they're usually just for drafting this is way faster. There is also no way of trading in any way, every TCG online or IRL should have this.I honestely believe that this had so much potential, both for seasoned players and as an introduction to new players but this game is so bad I would never admit to playing it.",0

But then I heard what they did to the game, and died a little. They ""REVAMPED"" the matchmaking by decreasing the amount of teirs that are sorted by your level, skill, and plane that helps to keep the powerful planes with people of their strength. This lead to said powerful planes (witch consits of paid planes too) to leak into the less powerful planes matches, and causing the less powerful planes to not have a plesent experiance. After hearing that and reading a few of the other reviews which gives a much better and more recent review, I am not happy.

14146,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI've been a fan of Artix games since I discovered Battleon back in middle school, so I jumped at the chance to play AQ3D. By all accounts, it's essentially  a 3-D rendering of AdventureQuest Worlds with a slightly different plot. If you're cool with that, great. If not, stick to AQWorlds.That said, I like this game. The new battle system,while keeping familiar control elements, is enough of a difference to keep you engaged, and the dialogue is par for the course what I've come to expect from this dev, so that was cool.At the moment, there doesn't seem to  be a party system in place, and there's no option for group/private chat.I'd reccomend waiting a bit for this one, until it's updated and given some more content, since at the moment it's a tutorial and a string of quests where you're essentially frog hunting.",1

15494,Team Fortress 2,2011.0,"Highly competitive shooter for tryhards. Make no mistake on that. Valve markets it as something else but it doesn't change what it is. It's NOT easy to pick up. If you're new to quake-like shooters, you'd better have a friend already playing it explain the basics to you, or you might get frustrated by some things.Public pvp and pve (known as mvm in tf2) servers are suitable for casual players once the basics are learned. If you don't want to go comp you can stop there and have quite a bit of fun.Sweaty competitive tryhards will really see where this game shines though. Well balanced, competitive modes will bring your tactical sense and deathmatch ability to a real test. Despite Valve overlooking the competitive format, multiple leagues have arisen offering unforgettable experience for teams on any skill level. If You want to do team based esports, look no further than TF2, this game has more competitive spirit in it than LoL and DOTA combined.As for visual aesthetics the game looks well despite its age, thanks to its stylised look. Some items from content updates are very much out of the game's theme, though, which is very disappointing given how unique that theme is. The game is poorly optimised in some instances too, (especially mvm), but that can be solved by fps boosting configs.All in all:Iz good.",1

Come on develop some real battlefield maps these tanks actually fought on not these 3rd rate maps you have now.

I have played the game over several years (about 1400 hours in steam and even before it came to steam), i have seen many updates, many hotfixes and nerfs. I can say that:#This game is dying.#Developers ARE NOT listening the community. #Developers don't really know what they are doing. (Best example: creating tons of skins over 1.5 years and yet not a single new assault map) #Developers ARE allied biased (USA & SU) and taking things personally when someone is adressing questions about German faction / Nazis. #And the biggest f**kup is the 1.12 update the developers rushed in, unfinished, unpolished, unreal.

The game is not pay to win at all; it's true that refinement items can be purchased through the cash shop but,  if you try to purchase all the refinement items that you would need;  you'd go broke! It costs so much to get anything in this game maxed out; you might aswell play the game and take your time. But that avalability of the items in the cash shop makes people (and by people I mean trolls and half-wits) a ""reason"" to spam in zone chat.

I do hope that the game would regain lost players and start growing once again but, this is just the hope of a long time player. If the Devs ever do see this I have some words of advice; make NEW content of quality! It doesnt have to tie into a masive  modle; it can just be a themed dungeon (like water, fire, air, or earth to tie into modle 6 or maybe raiding a massive bandit encampment if you want unrealated conent) with 3-4 bosses, some new loot, and even a random puzzle. Just some end game content that feels new;  you have a strong dev team that can pull content out of their♥♥♥♥♥if they wanted to;  even if you can make new textures you can reuse assets in new content, just aslong as we can have a new dungeon with new bosses and loot to run.

I already killed this guy why do I have to kill him in chicken form to get his stuff. It just wastes time.I like the idea of unique classes and abilities and that other classes cannot use a different class ability. Also that in order to get lengendary items, class weapons, abilities. You have to go to a forge (there are multiple forges on map) in which can end up being a bloodbath because everone will want to go to the forges to craft stuff. How do you craft stuff? You collect shards by destroying duplicates or basically every weapon, armor, abilities (dropped by other players).In other words I already love this game and only have like 48 minutes on it.

16764,Magic Duels,2015.0,"I tried. Honestly, I did.Magic Duels feels like it's still in closed beta testing. Give it a year, and maybe it will be a professional quality game.There are some good things. The tutorial is a good way to learn the rules if you're rusty or new, and long time players will appreciate some fan-favorite planeswalkers as your campaign heroes.  The interface is relatively intuitive in games, there's little need to micro your lands or other inane things like that. Smart-targeting is pretty spot on.But the bad is so much worse.First, because of the single-expansion run, combinations and deck builds are prohibitively railroad tracked.  ""Oh, that player is using a forest and swamp. GUESS IT'S AN ELF DECK.""  Many of the colors are only partially-flavored.  White doesn't really have a good angel deck option, Blue sky-dragon decks are possible, but pitifully weaker than just going for grindstone, Red burn decks will be waffling for an effective combination of spells unless you've completely maxed out your collection, so you'll probably go with an artifact heavy combination deck, and so forth.  So while there is enough that you can sample what each color usually offers, generally speaking it is only that: a sample, not intended for using in solo or pvp play.  As a deck builder who loves to design decks based on ""roleplay"", this is a serious strike against the game.Speaking of deck building, the helper tool is atrocious. And yet you MUST use it to get credit for the daily quests (or, perhaps that's bad luck on my part, but getting to that later).  Usually the deck builder establishes ""core"" and ""synergy"" categories, which are of course, the smallest categories.  The general category, making up the other 50% of your cards, is totally random from your collection of the matching colors, and you cannot cycle the options it gives you.  Shoehorned into an elf deck with a bunch of creatures with a mana cost <6? Tough nuts on you, deal with it.  Playing an artifact deck where you're only using six artifacts? Sorry you can't pick more, but you only have four cards to choose from at a time!  In the attempt to make it more accessible, the deck wizard is arguably BAD for you, teaching bad habits and making decks unnecessarily frustrating.Deck shuffling is just broken. Truly and honestly.  Most decks will need to run 24-28 lands to beat the RNG, which is absolutely ridiculous. Lifespring-Wyrm decks never needed that much. But if you don't, you WILL stall with dry spells. In an elf deck with 25 lands, I once got through 30 cards with only 4 lands drawn. That is the extreme example, but these kinds of games are the rule, not the exception as you'd find on tabletops. You are just as likely to encounter the opposite problem as well, dropping 15 lands but only drawing 4 spells while your opponent steamrolls your couple creatures and you sit on a useless sorcery. Again, these matches occur in tabletop MTG, but not to the frequency you'll have to deal with here. This compounds with the deck-building problem as you are not given the control to manage your average mana cost.Other minor problems are the AI being generally overtuned, and the fact that the daily quests will just up and decide that your deck doesn't ACTUALLY fit the colors its asking for.  My experience has also been that custom decks do not count towards the daily quests, but it's possible that I just keep getting the bug every time I try.In a year, with a few expansions under its belt and hopefully the kinks worked out, this game might be fun. Until then, avoid it. And good lord don't spend money on it.",0
13812,Dungeon Defenders II,2016.0,"Early Access Review20 April, 2017Surprise Surprise! Rebalance meant more nerfs!...I really have no words for the gross incompetence of all the dev's at this point.Seriously my review is probably going to turn into a hollywood horror film in a few years from now.Oh wait, I do have something to say.They EFFED the patch up hard, the new patch deleted 90% of shards IN YOUR BAGS.They EFFED up so badly, they had to shut the game down and re-patch it the next day with a rollback for all the deleted items.And since their patching system is so horribly optimized it meant you had to download the same patch (1,4GB) 3 times (Patch -> Rollback -> Fix Patch)Over 5GB for what amounts to statistical changes with no new content.If that doesn't scream incompetence then I don't know what does.5 April, 2017Still Garbage.Dev's stated that they're going to ""rebalance"" towers.What they did was nerf range even further.They cut any assension benefits by half (If you got 1% per level in X skill now it's 0.5%) And of course they monetized shards within the month of it's implementation.Tune in next time for 'What they EFFED up this week'Brought to you by the thriving 800~ or so playerbase.10 March, 2017It's still Garbage.Nerfs all around making towers even more useless.Hope you love buggy flamethrower towers or pay-up\grind for Abyss lord to use Ramsters.Those are your choices, have fun.14 Jul, 2016Trendy: Hey guys! I heard you we're having to much fun! Let me fix that for you.Trendy: Guys?....Trendy: Guys? I nerfed fixed it..TLDR: Hope you guy's enjoy farming for gear hour's on end only to have it nerfed on a weekly basis with the dev's ignoring every single criticism towards the game.Not to mention overpriced DLC that most AAA game's cant dream to get away with, but with a playebase averaging 1k~ on a good day what can you expect.",0

The game play here is more or less the same as minecraft but you have many more ""monsters"" or mobs to battle, it has a built in system for securing your ""land"" from the many trolls out there. And with the latest addition of the Blueprints it adds a lot more value to those who like to build. It offers a challenge to unlock all the craft recipes. The down side here is there is no ""Creative"" mode so you have to actually go out and find the materials to build and craft with... But I think that just makes the involvement better....It's free to play, however the ""Pro"" has a few more options and is well worth the buy for avid players",1

16145,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game seems fun, but the twich promotion is one of the worst executed advertisement i've seen. If you're going to attract new players who might have played other card games don't make them sit through a very long unskippable tutorial. I played through the tutorial and because of a verification issue had to relog and was made to start the tutorial all over. This completely killed any drive i had to try your game. There should really be a button to skip the tutorial, the fact that this isn't in a game in this day and age is baffling.",0
17181,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"This is in the top 2 TCGs for me. Recently, I switched to MTG Arena from Eternal, but it is still a good game. I have played all of the major TCGs (Hearthstone, TES Legends, MTG Arena).Other TCGs:  TES Legends -  offers competitive premade decks (that are affordable), which would be helpful for this game as well.   MTG Arena  - allows you to gain premium currency in-game without spending IRL money (through draft wins). Only TCG that allows you to do this that I know of. (Eternal offers twitch drops which do something similar, but no one wants to watch Twitch streams for drops, they want to play the game.)  Hearthstone - lul.Good stuff:  Free promo cards.   Most single-player content of any TCG.   You keep the cards you draft (this is also the case in MTG Arena).  Packs contain a lot of cards.Bad stuff:  If you don't log in during the time period for a promo, you have to craft them to get them. Not available in packs.  Too many cards for new players to learn: 4 sets in ""standard"" + promos + cards from 4 campaigns. I haven't heard any plans to rotate sets. Draft only offers 2 base packs and 2 packs of the newest set - which is good. Another set is coming December 2018.  Campaigns are too expensive to reasonably afford without paying IRL money. Getting campaigns with gold is also a waste, as you can draft 4-5 times for the same price.  Single-player ""Forge"" mode is a lot worse than the multiplayer draft version. Single player rewards are a bit lacking in general.  No real reason or incentive to buy packs, just rare draft or join a league. (Draft is 5k gold for 4 packs and you can rare draft. League is 12.5K gold for 14 packs. Packs are 1k gold each.)Overall, would reccomend for single-player gameplay. You are going to get destroyed online as a new player (same as every other tcg). PS: Pls add Linux version.",1
1692,DCS World Steam Edition,2018.0,"Superb game engine but spoilt by the fact that the DLC's are viciously expensive. You cant even fire a gun in the free P-51 which defeats the object of it being a training platform. If the planes were cheaper or maybe in bundles that you could save a bit on, then it would beat IL2 hands down and I think more people would use it as their go to sim. I love playing it for the feel and immersion of a fully interactive cockpit, but I am not going to pay these sort of prices for a DLC, unfortunately this seems to be the way on Steam nowadays, cheap or free games with extortionate DLC's to bring them up to what they should have been in the first place.",1

2075,War Thunder,2013.0,"Well, this game used to be very fun and very interesting.  However, the recent changes to the economy, including the tier/research revamp, have caused the people I play with and myself to stagnate horribly.  Now, I feel like I am not getting any closer to a high-tier fighter.  That is because I am not.  On average, I have received about 500 points towards a new plane, which costs about 120,000.  That's about half a percentage.  Granted, before the XP system was flawed similarly, but you unlocked every plane for a level once you leveled up, and there were times when I got 10,000-20,000 XP, so now I have to play approximately 4 times as many games to unlock just ONE PLANE.  Not to mention, I then have to pay for it with lions, the game's currency.  So, while the early tiers seem to be pretty much the same, more or less, after about tier 3 the game becomes an unbearable grind.  So, if you feel like grinding for hundreds of hours, feel free, and obviously there are casual options.  However, I would suggest purchasing premium/eagles or waiting until they fix the economy.",0

6802,WARMODE,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThe movement is buggy, crouching is buggy, the mouse movement is laggy and feels non-responsive. The servers suck, the UI is trash and the community is whining about hackers all the time (most of it is just lag from my experience). The guns are ridiculously op, the spawns are broken, there are angles that provide immense advantage (others players can't shoot you), there is no need for iron sights. However, I had loads of fun playing this game. Headshotting from 2km away with a pistol is satisfying. The game is really small in size and for the time being it is truly f2p. I like the point system to buy guns but I think you should be able to gain points over time. Also more options should be implemented (FOV slider for example). The game needs a lot of work but it has the potential to have something going for it as far as I am concerned. Overall, I thought the game was fun and I could oversee the flaws. I recommend it if you want to pass some free time. In the future I might revisit it and maybe change my recommendation but for the time being this game is fairly fun.",1

10192,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2017.0,"I've played this game for a month (apparently), but I played on Android and Memu. The new Steam version is the same and performs better than on an emulator, with added screen for card info and duel log. But the game? In a nutshell, it's pay2win gamblebox hell. Let me explain...Cards in this game are Common (C), Rare (R), Super Rare (SR), or Ultra Rare (UR). Gems are the free currency, but they're hard to come by. 50 gems (or $1) gets you 1 pack containing 3 cards (2 C's + R or better). The packs are bought from account-based boxes that can be reset*. Each box contains 200 (or ~85**) packs which contain 1 copy of every UR for that set, 1-2 SR, and a lot of R's and C's. C's and R's are virtually worthless in competitive play, SR's are good (some godly), but UR's are the real cards that make your deck WORK. Your deck only contains 20 cards so the game is based around tight strategies that usually revolve around key UR cards.Now lets do some math... If you grind 50+ duels per day for a YEAR (19,000+ total) and complete all the limited time events, you'll be able to get all the characters to level 40 and buy around 1,000 packs. At worst, it takes 600 packs to get 3 copies of any UR you want. This means that you'll be able to bulid 1 half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥competitive deck OR snatch a variety of useful/splashable/tech cards (like Sphere Kuriboh) and build more PvE based decks. Either way, you just spent a year of your life on this crap and are still missing majority of the cards, decks, and fun. Also, a new box is released roughly every month, bringing new p2w meta decks and tech cards with the same power creep as the original card game. There are now 8 full boxes and 7 mini-boxes. In ADDITION to this demon of a grind, you'd need to spend about $1000+ to get the rest of the cards, or $5000+ if you want 3 copies of everything. AND you still don't have them all, now you have to grind Legendary duelists for the rest.To make matters worse, this grind is BORING. You mostly just auto-duel and tap on your screen every few minutes, and have to recharge standard duelists (hourly energy system). They don't even give you more XP when they level up, but they'll use multiple copies of strong cards that aren't even available in the game! The dev's must love salt.The game also suffers from simple technical issues (crashes etc.) and slow pace. Obvious decisions aren't automated, so you have to keep tapping buttons even when there's only one possible outcome***. It requires an always online connection too, and uses a lot of resources.Duel Links had a lot of potential but Konami ♥♥♥♥ed it up as usual. Stay away if you value your wallet. If you want a free card game, play Chess Evolved Online instead.*If you get lucky and pull all the UR's you want you can reset the box, because otherwise you won't pull any more.**Every other box is a mini-box.***""I see you're using Polymerization to summon Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon, and there are no other possible combos. But please, slowly select all 3 Blue-Eyes White Dragons in your hand and confirm that you are indeed doing what you've already set out to do."" This engine is bad!",0

14822,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe last major update really dumbed down the game, before you would have to really put some thinking into parts purchase, get better armor cubes? or shields? or guns? one had to play  with th diferent cubes armor rating in order to protect the vital parts of the robot (besides other things). Now if you just make a bot with a bunch of blocks and strap a bunch of guns and you can survive for ages! Before one could get one shot kill with bombers or  railguns if hit the right robot spot, Now it takes forever to destroy pretty much anyone because everyone uses the same blocks. Block type is one variable removed that helped to make the game challenging.A bad remark also for the non-compensation on blocks when the update was made, some of us have spent a lot on blocks and that was a waste of time and money for some. I'm glad i didn't spent any money on this game otherwise I would lose the investment in blocks. I don't recomend to spend money on this game because you can lose your items overnight in some crazy update or your item can be rendered useless by an updateAnother one is the pilot seat removal, it helps to create diferent shapes of robots, but now you don't have to protect your sweet spot! again, making the game easier by removing the sweet spot and the limitations the pilot seat had.The worst one is the auto healing, this completly changed the game dynamics! before you had to think on how to build your robot even for the case it would get damaged, making sacrificial parts to be blown when under attack. Also you had to put some extra locomotion parts, in case you would lose wings, wheels, etc. when under attack. Now you have auto healing! no need for this! just hover your bot over a mountain, if someone shoots you down, just lay on there hidden (when possible) and wait to be up and running again! Same for tanks, just hide in a corner when your health is getting low.Before the update you would think twice before engaging, now everyone is Kamikaze! before you could damage an airplane or tank useless with a couple of shots, so people would be carefull when atacking, now everyone just charges ahead full steam! Also untill the introduction of the AA canon, the game was quite unbalanced, air units had a massive advantage because of the hit and run tatic, T10 block and the auto regen.Only good remark was the introduction of colours.Al said, I think the game was dumbed down in order to attract more people and to please fustrated users who couldn't do a good robot or use them properly.  The developers want to please everyone and attract more people  making the game  more ""arcadish""  but they are scaring some fans away and killing the thing that made the game special, I know I don't play as much asI used to!It was a very good and addictive game now I guess it's just ok, something to fill that 10 min break.PS: sorry for any misspeling, no spell check was used.",0

I will continue to play this game, but I would not recommend. At least, not until they bring back classes (If they bring them back).

Tonight is what finally ended it for me: there have been problems for the last few months of Hi Rez releasing overpowered gods, but the recent patch were Freya was changed finally came to create its downfall for me. I didn't feel that the most recent god, Pele, was unbalanced, and I thought that Smite might be recovering from the unfortunate recent history of making certain gods overpowerered and nerfing the heck out of gods who used to be fun to play. However, when one god (in this case Freya) can hit you for 2x your maximum health (granted I was playing a hunter), it becomes no longer fun to play the game. You try to play a god because you enjoy them, but there are broken gods still in the game that prevent you from being able to play a normal, balanced god. Your only option is to play another broken god, and the game loses its excitemnent that was arond since it first was released as a beta. I'm sorry to all of the new smite players who were hoping to join the community. It just isn't the same game it was a couple of years ago. I truely enjoyed this game once, but my time with it has come to an end.",0
5170,Brawlhalla,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewAt the point of me writing this review i have a grand total of 0.4 hours spent.I absolutely love this game, the fun mix of Super Smash Bros. with the addictive gameplay of the minigames in Battleblock Theatre. and the best part is that to get in on the action is easy. just sign upUnfortunately at the current Beta, the only server is based in America, living in Australia made this difficult to have an immersive fight with someone across the globe.Trust me when i say this, follow this game, it is going to be something big",1
15137,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2016.0,"I honestly don't even know how or where to start with this game. It has no form of tutorial, guide, basic series of single player practice sessions to show you what you get with the game, what you have, game modes, anything. It is basically just a very very old school pick a series pick a car, hit race....that's pretty much it. I find it quite surprising that it has so many users with such a bad interface and menu structure. As a user you honestly don't know where to start.After some trial and error I eventually discovered that most cars need to be bought, you only get....actually I don't know what you get because it doesn't list anywhere how many or which cars you do get. It's just such a bad user experience. Even ACR with all its problems and browser client mishmash was far supperior.The first time I started it I basically just got the background cinematics and no menu. After googling around I found that you have to set a start parameter for the steam version. Why isn't this set as standard? Didn't I just install the game through steam?So after you eventualy get it to work, you have to wonder if you actually have any sound, because there are no effects what so ever in the menu. No clicking efects, no music, no nothing. I played around with my volume until I entered a race and it was too loud. And finaly we come to the actual driving experience....well...if you use a controller or keyboard you are basically hosed. The cars are mostly unconstrollable unless you have a wheel, and even then I'm not sure the default settings are ok. After much fiddling around with sensitivities, adaptive steering speeds and other settings, I managed to get a relatively ok setting. It worked fine for the car I was using at the time, but as soon as I changed cars, well I needed to see what I could do again.The menu/interface thing is quite buggy and unintuitive. You have a back button to go back to the game and if you hit back inside the game, as in to go back to the main menu...it takes you back into the matchmaking menu...so basically and infinite loop of back buttons. Now on to the plus points:After trying out multiple cars, I do have to admit you could ""feel"" when one car was heavyer, or lighter, or had softer suspension and that is a very very good thing. It becomes pretty obvious that underneath the bad interface it is running a very good simulation engine. On the polish oldtimer you can feel the heavy engine at the back trying to oversteer the car. On different DTM cars of the same era/class you can feel the different personlity of each car. I really like that. For example you can tell the Audi V8 is very heavy compared to the Merc 190 or the M3, you can feel that the Mustang has much softer suspension but is stil quite light. The FWD cars do understear in slow corners, and they do lift off oversteer just like they should. Dips in the road do make your car unstable and sometimes create wheelspin (this also sais a lot about the quality and detail of the tracks). This is especially noticeable on some longer high speed corners. The vibrators on the side of the track do unsettle your car and can make it jump up in the air. So yes, the racing engine underheath is very very good.The graphics do look good for a racing game. There's not much to say about them. Everything runs smoothly no stutters, high FPS. The amount of detail given to the sound during racing is quite high. It has suspension and pannel squeking. I'm quite dissapointed to be honest, I really liked all their previous games and those did have much better interfaces and functionality. This is just slopy in so many ways.From what I have played so far I am tempted to try it some more just because that surprisingly good engine underneath that crap interface. I haven't yet found out how exacly you enter a multiplayer race, there are some challenges and some servers, but instructions are scarce at best. I don't even think there is any form of experience or leveling, but if there is, I wasn't able to find it.",0

10463,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewIs it fun? Yes.Is it worth money? Depends.The game is an early access version of what will eventually be a free to play game, with a tech tree similar to the likes of War Thunder or World of Tanks. However, it throws away the tiers, and instead balances all ships together into one matchmaking block, similar to Mechwarrior Online. It's enjoyable for a while, but the grind begins to get excessive. The good news is that you're not going to need to worry about repairs or ammo costs, which eliminates a point of stress in the grinding. The graphics are also absolutely beautiful. Unreal Engine 4 is put to the max, and boy does it look good. The ships also are interestingly designed.The game has two modes - a TDM style mode, and a capture the base mode. Both are enjoyable, but something like this could really use some more modes to keep its longevity. And now, onto the negatives. These modes won't keep your attention forever, and you'll quickly want more. The various classes of ships give a huge variety of playstyles, but again - you will be grinding a while to get a ship you may or may not like. UNLESS, of course, you decide to throw money at premium currency, in which case you can push to that ship faster, and this is a bit of a problem... unless you've snagged the game on a free-forever weekend, you've already tossed money at the game, and now they are asking for more money via microtransactions. This however, is only a temporary problem, since the game needn't be bought once it gets released.There also are major server issues, despite there only being a peak of about 1000 players online IN THE WORLD. Half the matches I'm in, I'll get severe lag stutters that are serverside, not on my end.Final thoughts - I'd suggest you DEFINITELY get the game on one if its free-forever weekends. It'll definitely net you enough enjoyment to be worth the download. If you want to get the game with money, I'd also say it's probably worth it, especially with the steam refunds should you not like it. Will it be worth the microtransactions? You decide.",1

6355,Paladins®,2018.0,"www.mkaugaming.comPaladins: Champions of the Realm is a Free-To-Play title from Hi-Rez Studios. It began in September 2016 as an Early Access game and is now in full release. Hi-Rez Studios have started making some huge growth in the Free-To-Play field, with titles such as Smite, Hand of the Gods and their new successful title Realm Royale.I will be honest from the start and state I was sceptical going into this title as these styles of games have failed in the past to keep my attention. For some out there Paladins shares a lot of ideas and creations similar to Overwatch, and for me that game wasn’t to my taste. That is not saying it is a bad game, just not my style of game. I Have nothing but respect for that title and the hard work that went into it and can see why it is so popular but as I said just was not for me. Well Paladins taught me a huge lesson.This game is just so much fun, having friends to play with is a huge advantage as it is a very strategic game and requires communication. Picking the right Champions is also a must, as they all have their advantages and disadvantages but getting the right balance is a game changer.  The game itself has so much to offer but does require you gain enough experience and in-game currency (gold and crystals) to unlock these. The base game comes with 5 characters and an additional 4 that are rotated every two weeks. I am reviewing the Deluxe Edition which includes all the current DLC available. There are 37 champions (playable characters) to enter the battles with, these are separated in to four categories.•Damage•Flank•Front Line•SupportAs with other titles in this genre it is recommended you choose within these guidelines to have a strong team, but it is not required. As I mentioned before it is a team-based game and requires you all work together and choose the right team to gain that advantage in battle. All characters also have cards you can customise in your own loadouts offering their benefits in battle but require a lot of learning on the job so at times it can be a strong learning curve. The champions have their own levels you can increase with gold or battle experience offering unlockables as you progress but there is also an account level to show your overall progress across the game.There are several game modes available, but the two I found the most exciting were Team Deathmatch and Siege. TDM is self-explanatory but Siege begins with both teams rushing to the centre on their mounts to capture the Payload and push towards the opposing teams base. There is also Ranked Matchmaking, but this requires at least 14 unlocked champions and reaching account level 15. But do not go into this lightly, as most games are against teams that are well adverse in the workings and strategy of the game. Hi-Rez Studios are doing great work to continually keep you coming back, with events, new characters and unlockables. The current event Rise of Furia is so intense, requiring both teams to race to the top of the Demonic Spire while the Abyss Rises but it is not as simple as it may seem. With you being required to jump across platforms (warning some do fall) and small chain links making each step possibly your last. Once at the top it is an all-out team deathmatch battle with great atmospheres and entertaining cut scenes to set the story for the event. Alongside the event are unlockables in keeping with the style and story of the event.Paladins is a game I highly recommend playing, not only is it fast and frantic fun online it also offers so much for those gamers that enjoy the glory of showing off their hard work through their unlockables and rank. The game runs so smoothly on PC and that extra FPS gained from PC Gaming makes it so much more controllable when aiming and keeping your surroundings in check. The sound effects and music are so well presented and for me the title music alone is a hard-hitting rock soundtrack that just sticks in my head. It is Free-To-Play so what is stopping you from checking out this gem of a title. Honestly, I will continue to play this on a regular basis (free time permitted). ",1

13643,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's an enjoyable Free-to-Play Hero Shooter with 3 modes; The main one being capturing the objective and then pushing it to the enemy base, the second one focusing solely on pushing the objective, and the last one being typical point-based deathmatch. It's all pretty standard.Some time ago there was also a survival mode where everyone had just one life, but they removed it for some reason. What it already has is decent enough, but it could use some more varied ways to play and have fun.There's no real lore or story here, unlike other popular Hero Shooter/Moba games, just some one-liners and jokes to give the colorful cast some character.But it doesn't need any, in this type of game, it's all about characters and gameplay.The characters are hit and miss, but that's just my opinion. They all offer something unique to the table and are fun to play with (Unique in regards to this game and its characters. You will find a lot of parallels between Paladins and Overwatch or TF2.)There are also plenty of maps to play with and much more to come (with the being available to players for testing, which is a nice idea, involving the playerbase into some part of the creation of the game.) all of them being colorful and generally well designed.Of course, there are still a lot of glitches and broken elements present, but it's understandable as it is still in the Open Beta, and the developers are constantly working on it, throwing in patches after patches, changes, and new content.It's amazing to see. Especially recently, when they were introducing new Champion every single month.But then, Cards Unbound happened...A new patch that basically threw away the unique loadout system that differentiated it from the other Hero Shooters, allowing the player a lot of customization of Hero's abilities to suit their playstyles while still being balanced, which was easily the best part of this game...And instead they put in a system that not only removed all the balance from the game modes where the vast majority of players are, but also turned the grind up to eleven, making it really annoying for the old players, horrible for the new ones, and more Pay-to-Win than it was ever before (and the funny thing is, they've decided it was a good idea to announce it right after the StarWars Battlefront 2 afair,) pretty much forcing the players to use what they get from lootboxes rather than building the loadout they want... so they wouldn't get destroyed all the time by players that have all their cards maxed out without any limits.To be fair... I didn't really test those changes for myself, so it may be that I misunderstood some mechanics of it, but in any way, it's blatantly obvious what they're trying to do.It's really sad and disappointing, which is why I won't be giving it any more of my time, despite the game being fun.

So after my expensive fleet gets destroyed from pvp or pve, I have a 12 hour repair time before I can use that fleet again.  I could spend a few bucks and have it ready instantly but my play style doesnt demand that.  I can simply wait until the next day and use that fleet again.The development of the game has its ups and downs.  Certain fleet configurations that work exceptional well have been ""balanced"" to prevent them from being used without needing to repair more and if you want them ready instantly (pay real money)its fun to play and more fun with a team of people.

699,Neverwinter,2016.0,After having played this game for almost a year I can't suggest it. The game is a good concept driven to the grown by bad marketing and unbalance. The basic of the game is you running around in glitchy maps and trying to do quests that may or may not exist anymore. After leveling up 68-69 levels you will experience an extreme grind to 70 which is the cap. End game content includes you running for almost a month in the same map doing the same 3 quests every week with little to no compention.If you're hoping PVP is better try again as it is highly unbalanced with Trickster Rogues which will Stun you into death and can go invisible taking the lead. The next pvp prefered class are Paladin which can restore their own HP so good luck dying to them. If you choose any other class besides those get ready as the Devs and everyone involved with this game love and exploit you for your money. oh and if you want to bot exploit or scam you can too! just add money every week and they wont even ban you for cheating they'll suppend you for a week tops.

We will meet a lot of familiar characters, take part in familiar events and how to properly ponostalgiruem.I will make a reservation that this video passage was created in order to consider the plot of the game and compare it with the books ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"", and not run through the whole game, skipping past the description of the quests and doing endless shooting of monsters.

17235,Realm of the Mad God,2014.0,"This is a GREAT game!It is a simple 2d MMORPG based on fast paced action and battles.

There are good classes, although sometimes you go for a long stretch of time without any gear for your class. Bosses do get repetitive  sometimes but then the server changes to a new area, then 50 players at once start fighting out at once and it is UTTER CHAOS!This is a fun, simple game that is worth your time and download.. ONLY 38 MB AND ITS FREE!WHY DONT U HAVE IT?8/10",1

781,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewOkay, have to update my review of this game again. Its like the 5th time or so. Gameplay is good and fun. I have become addicted to this game. 2 vs 2 adds alot.  It would be nice, to get all the cards with one price. If that is added later, that would be great. Rush decks have been changed, cards in general are  changed(not nerfed into oblivion like other developer handle such things) regulary.Lots of problems have been addressedOverall positiveI left the bad things in my old review that still stand. Deleted the outdated problems.Old review:In short:If this wasn't free to play, it could have been good.Its extreme slow in getting new cards after the initial phase.And you need a good pool of cards to stopp different decks.Problems:1: Slowness of getting new cards:1000 Gold per Card. a won match is 8 Gold (with premium upgrade 16 Gold). Losing gives like 4 Gold. O.Odaily quest give you one card. Rarity systems prevents you from getting the useful cards.The other daily thing, this free spin only gives you small amounts of money, rubies or mana. You have to spin every day for 15 days to get 1 card.Also you can use like 3 times the same card in your deck. So disenchanting your exess cards will not happen until very late.  If i get a card one time, why can' i simply put it in 3 times in a deck? Because they want to sell me cards would be the answer. In the beginning it draws you in with new cards every 3 matches. Then it stops, even with premium upgrade it becomes a boring grind with losing a lot of times.Why losing a lot of times? See point 2",1

To sell them, Gaijin not only break the cannon of this game alone with the balance, but also make grinding new vehicles extremely hard for anyone that does not own one such P2W item as well as premium account. i.e. making this game impossibly unfriendly to new players(let alone the already cliff learning curve).Therefore, i do not recommend this game for new comers.

5225,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"This is easily the best digital card game out there. It beats Heartstone in the simple fact that the MINIMUM deck size is 50 (Heartstones MAX limit of 30 is arbitrary and the single worst limitation of the whole game, maybe it's changed by now but I've moved on, a long time ago); it's awesome. I've played many games solo and online where the end came down to an unexpected single card to turn the tide of the game and win; it's awesome. The amount of ways to play, solo, online, story, arenas, random weekly challenges; it's awesome. It's effectively identical to Magic: The Gathering except that they do away with specific mana, like Hearthstone it's a pool that grows each turn, that's honestly the only difference I can spot; it's awesome. The story mode is great, you get specific winnings, there are unique game conditions; it's awesome. If you like MTG but wish their online version was way better, you should really play this, and Wizards of the Coast should take notes. Thank you Bethesda!",1

12097,Dota 2,2014.0,"Dota 2 is a first person MMO RPG survival horror game developed by EA and EA only where you have to fight to survive in the drunken robot zombie apocalypse with nothing but your bare feet, as your hands are too pre-occupied taking off your panties in excitement for this sick filth.The main protagonist is you, Jakob. You are a lone survivor and every other player in the entire damn universe is an enemy. Jakob's model really matches his personality. A hipster, emo, gothic sex-driven male paired with the voice acting of Morgan Freeman really make this character pop out and helps make him really relatable.The storyline is great. I love how the developers have a completely separate ""prologue"" chapter for the story, explaining how such an apocalypse could have ever risen from the deep depths of hell (that's not a spoiler as you see that in the first 15 minutes of the game). You start out in the middle of Россия... er, Russia, spending time with your beloved family, and find out you are really, REALLY attracted to your cousin. You take her out to ""show her the world"" when suddenly a crack opens from the ground beneath you. Your cousin falls into the crevice. You are devastated. You try to rush home, but then all of a sudden, you hear a big шлеп... er, plop. You look behind you, and there are robot zombies, all drinking vodka. You then turn all around and find yourself surrounded. And I'll stop there, otherwise I may end up spoiling the prologue!The PvP in this game is SPOT ON. It's like the developers KNOW that you're the main character and give you the most overpowered arsenal right from the get-go! It's brilliant, need I say more? Fine, I shall! Just like the amazingness that was Dungeon Keeper Mobile, you too can attain the most powerful arsenal by slamming your wallet into EA's pockets! It's fantastic!The best part too? It's бесплатно--free. Если вы грязная американская свинья, кто не любит водку, то вы позор. Um, what I meant to say was ""It doesn't even cost a dime!""Overall I would say this game is a 10/10, a must-have game. EA has really shown how to create such a game.

17946,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,"This used to be my go-to F2P casual FPS game until patch 1.12 ruined it. Here are some of the changes that came with the patch:- Light tanks can drive under and flip medium/heavy tanks then kill them (I witnessed an M2A2 do this to a Panther)- Tanks can cook off multiple times but still be operational- Tanks are now incredibly tanky (I know, crazy, but...) because the anti-tank weapons designed to destroy or disable tanks are now useless agaisnt them with the new locational damage system (e.g. 8 Panzershrek rockets to kill a light tank)- Plane damage against ground vehicles (see: tanks) multiplied by 20x just so the planes can actually destroy them (this was actually post patch 1.12 by the way)- And more (like instant spawns on everyone, meaning planes can now bomb you while you run to the first point because they got rid of all the bicycles in a previous patch)this is just stuff I remember after not playing the game for a few months. Everyone who's saying ""but this new update made the game so much more realistic!"" ... this game was always arcade-y and it still IS even after the vehicles update. There was no reason to make the game more realistic because (imo) it ruins the charm of the game, but they also completely ♥♥♥♥ed up the implementation of it so it's not even a fun kind of realism. If they had added killable crews to tanks (e.g. hafthohlladung kills some or all crew members on detonation) the game would probably still be fine. Oops I accidentally ranteddon't play this game for nowI would have recommended it before patch 1.12, despite the glaring flaws, but now that a lot of the veteran players are leaving and RETO is rebranding the game into something it's not ever going to become... it's done, don't subject yourself to this♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Side note: I think they're banning veterans on the forum for criticising the recent patches? Can't actually confirm this but I wouldn't put it past 'em",0
11194,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"I would definitely recommend this game.Pros: F2P.  Four continents so if one gets stale you can warp to another.  Massive fights.  Get xp from kills, supporting (reviving, ammo, repairing, capping points / sites, etc.), squad / platoon teamwork.XP gets you certs in which you use to unlock what you want whether it be skills for classes or weapons.  There's so many things to unlock weapons for infantry and vehicles, leadership (Ex. squad spawn beacon / reuse time, request reinforcements server wide, etc.  NOTE: You will find these under the social menu) skills, consumables such as health kits, different types of nades for different classes, etc.You can use certs to unlock weapons but before you spend your hard earned certs you can try any weapon / vehicle / attachment out in VR Training (Go to the world terminal in a warp gate and you'll see it in the bottom left, green button).Squad / platoon based gameplay (very well done too much to explain) with in game comms (Tip: to mute anyone talking hit enter on the numpad.  To turn their volume up hit the + and to turn them down hit the - on the numpad.  You battle for resources on the map (capturing / holding hexes) and use those resources to resupply consumables (such as nades, healing kits, etc.), spawn vehicles, and aircraft.  More squad info. below.----Cons: Weapon balancing can be an issue, nerf wheel comes into play at times.  If you buy rmt (real money transaction) (Use VR Training before you do to see if you like said weap / attachment / vehicle) or use certs for different weapons they may nerf said item down the road and make it almost useless which leaves you feeling ripped off (If big changes come out for like attachments they usually refund your certs though).  For example, there's weapons in the  game that have lock on.  At the time you had to buy one for anti-aircraft (AA) and anti-tank (AT) if you wanted one for each, then they added one that locked onto both later, but that wasn't the nerf.  One nerf was for aircraft they severely reduced the range at which you could start locking on.  Lock on takes 4 seconds mind you so now by the time you start locking on (they will use flares and bug out by the then but say they already used flares and aren't long gone..) they are behind terrain or break LoS (which anything breaks line of site).  Lets say all the above didn't  happen and you're trying to lock onto an aircraft all they have to  do is keep moving and they'll be out of range to finish the lock on.Aircraft are overpowered in this game.  They counter vehicles infantry and base defenses.  This is in the hands of a decent pilot of course, great pilots are scary.  Not all aircraft are created equal either. NOTE:Then again, if you get with a group that will actually work together, you can get a squad of MAXs (a class that uses resources and is much tougher than normal infantry) with anti-aircraft (AA) weapons or HA (Heavy Assault), you can create a no fly zone, swatting any enemy air that flies by.  Teamwork is heavily rewarded in this game.  For example, field of tanks in front of your base?  Get a squad of heavies or MAXs and all fire on a single tank at a time and watch as your squad takes them all out 1 by 1, and oh hey, there's another squad member giving you ammo while doing it, and hey there's a medic rez'ing anyone that gets downed, oh look there's a Infiltrator using recon devices showing you where all the enemies are he also hacked the turret across the way at  the enemies base and is shooting them from behind with their own weapons.  All the while your entire squad is getting bonus XP for being at the squad waypoint, defending  a base, taking out enemy armor, assists, and just for being in a squad.  This is a MMO after all people.Client based hit detection.  This means you could be safely behind cover on your screen and still get dead a second later because on the enemies screen they're still hitting you.  Same thing applies to you of course shooting an enemy.There's a lot of minor things that irk me but that's the same with many mmos.Can take a long time to get certs especially if you're not playing medic or engineer ( 1 cert every 250xp or something like that).  But thats expected sort of they don't want to  give you everything right now.  It's not that bad and with the recent changes it's a lot better tbh.-------Advice for new players:Find an outfit (guild) and ask questions.When people are talking you can turn them up default: Keypad +  and turn them down: Keypad -You can also mute anyone talking by hitting: Keypad EnterVery handy shortcuts indeedIf you see someone on the battlefield and you want to send them a whisper, HOLD   Q and you will get many options such as sent whisper, add friend, ignore, etc.  You can also right click their name in the chat window if it has brackets around it (like when someone kills you, you can right click their name and send them a tell.  You can whisper people across servers in all SOE games iirc, do a google search on specifics.Hit Q to spot enemies.  It helps your team and you get bonus XP.  Keep in mind if enemies are close they can hear you (be especially mindful if you're and infiltrator, this can get you killed).Look up some tutorials on youtube, some are outdated but most still give good information.Try out weapons / attachments / vehicles in VR training before spending certs or buying with cash.When you join a squad you can filter by all squads on that continent, has people in your outfit, etc.  When you join a squad you can hit ""Insert"" to immediately deploy near your squad leader, so you don't have to trek all the way to the front lines.The ""U"" key will redeploy you, think of suicide but doesn't affect your stats.  For example if you're on a kill streak, redeploying will not affect your kill streak, you can redeploy to another spawn location, kill an enemy and you will be on an 11 kill streak, etc.If you're going to pull armor, be an engineer so you can repair yourself.If you're an infiltrator you can hack enemy terminals / turrets (Default is to go up to it when you see the words appear, HOLD ""E"" and it will hack it, give you xp, and turn the terminal / turret to your teams and only your team can use it.  It stays that way until either it's hacked back by their infils or it gets destroyed.  You can use this to spawn vehicles behind enemy lines.  You can spawn a sunderer, find a hiding spot, and deploy it (Deploy is default ""B"" and you can't deploy in a red circle on the minimap or a white circle that another sunderer shows up with meaning you can't deploy near another deployed sunderer), then your team can spawn in that sunderer and take the base / destroy enemies from behind.If you're base is getting sieged by  the enemy don't stay in spawn, for the love of Vanu GET ON ZE POINT!  New players just stay in the spawn and do nothing basically, so what if you die.  Here's an idea, get in a squad / platoon, coordinate, all spawn MAXs, engies, medics, and MAX Crash the point, take it, and force the enemy out of your base.  Teamwork people, teamwork.You can use voice call outs default "" V "" and you can request ammo, or a heal, taunt, etc.If your voice comms gets screwed up, go into voice options, uncheck the use voice box, and recheck it.Hit "" M  "" to open the map, top drop down shows all the worlds, the orange blips show how much fighting is going on, there are also squad deploy and instant action buttons on the bottom left.Friendly fire is ON, don't just spam nades and such if there's alot of your  team mates around, and if you friendly  fire too much your weapons will be locked.I might add more later but youtube is your friend just do a search for a guide / tips.All in all, this is an amazing game and you should definitely try it!",1
2086,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewOkay so Robocraft used to be a good game. That is as simple as I can make this. I used to love logging in and building robots and fighting against other people, seeing creativity and combat come together like some brilliant child fantasy of building things out of lego and smashing them together, or whatever. But seriously, what the f*** happened? After about 5 good games of robocraft I could walk away with on average around 200,000 to 500,000 in the game currency and buy loads of cool items and build loads of new robots with crazy designs. BUT. Now it's so disgusting, the entire combat sytem is somewhat still enjoyable, but now, you've got to be so good at the game to get some weird loot reward thing at the end of a match to get items that YOU DON'T EVEN WANT. I think in one game i was rewarded a 'protanium chest' or whatever (which i beleive is the best loot box you can get) and I got absolutely f*** all in it. I sold the crap from the box for abour 2,000 'Robits'. How the hell are new people playing the game supposed to get money to build a robot? I'm stuck with the three worst robots in exsistence and i can't do f*** all about it. I'm struggling to fight againts people who were lucky enough to have a good robot built before this 'apocalype' update occured. This game seriously needs to be fixed, like back to the way it used to be when you could actually get money to upgrade your bots and do well in matches so you can actually have fun. Honestly, the people behind this game are absolute idiots, they need to wake up and realise that what they are doing is putting players off completely. I do not recommend this game AT ALL. However I do recomend that you cry like a baby like me so that we players who USED to love the game can enjoy it once more. Thanks.",0
18022,Infestation: The New Z,2017.0,"Not only at how many hours I've now, but based on how many I have played (even before steam release), I think I can write a honest review.First of all, this is a great game with lot's of potential, that's why i've been playing it for quite a time.But the developers on this game decided to make it even more painfull for new or beginning players, to enjoy the game.As you know, in this game you can buy items with Game Dollars, GC and Bandage DX. In the latest patch of Januari they decided to remove the DX as a currency, and all DX above 10000 were exchanged for Game Dollars. Which made it almost impossible to buy snipers or gear from the store. Because of the ridiculous high prices.Second of all, they reduced drops from Super Zombies and from loot crates etc.It was hard to get loot, not only because the PVE servers are always full and renting a private server has been disabled for over 3-4 months, but because once you spawn in all the people are:- Full Geared- Clans from 3 to 11 people- Have trained skilltree so they have a small advantage- Have better weapons or attachments to kill you easily.With that being said about adventages, the biggest adventage is that it's Pay to Win.You can buy credits with real money, exchange it for skins or skinboxes or DX, trade it for all kinds of gear. And Tadaaa! You now have a full global inventory, and you never need to worry about losing items.That's not the game it used to be, and it's really sad to see it has come to this.I hope I made clear why you shouldn't invest time or money in this game, as it only rewards you with an empty global inventory, or an empty wallet.Small summary of pro's and con's.Pros:- Cool and unique PVP- Clan system is unique- Killstreaks are being rewarded with more cash- Reputation system, rewards you for killing bandits or -rep, or give you negative rep if you kill civilians or +rep- You can find all sorts of items across map.Cons:- Really low and small loot for a server like this. (No snipers and almost no crates.)- Too many clans or friends teaming up.- Every server there is different PVP city.- Spawning in an other map teleports your character to a new random location (You can never use 1 character on multiple maps without spawning at a random locatian everytime you spawn.)- Pay to win (All advantages you get for being premium are just too many)- Skill cap is too high, (you have beginner servers, but only someone with 0 kills and below 72 hours can play on it)- Premium servers PVP with Cars (Yes I know, it's ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the hitbox is just so big)- Hackers and Laggers all over the place- Haven't I said enough to convice you not to play this game?Anyway, I hope this review helps you considering to play this game yes or no.Thanks for reading!",0
10205,Champions Online,2014.0,"Product received for freeUpdated Review 2018My previous review for this game was not that great so i want to redo it.Let me get the positives out the way first.1. Game is free to play.2. The Aggro system seem to have been modified properly so now there is less issue with healer death. Before the tank would lose aggro so much it was not worth playing a healer.3. The character creator is still rather decent. There are a large amount of customization option and you options re ever expanding as you play the game and find new items to add to you ""Dressing room"" so to speak.4. You can make a Nimesis allowing you to customize your characters back ground (to a degree) this will open up new missions for you to play.5. You can have your own secret base.6.It has been made easier to level so that you can get to end game and completely dailies and such.7. Comic book missions are amazing. Ever since i first played this game the thing that had me hooked was the Until comic book missions and other comic stories.Now the Negatives1. Story is basically non-existant. ""Be a hero"" that is all. There is no specific big bad. You get a nimesis but in general its more of an annoyance then a perk as you will get missions2. I have come back and forth to this game to ask the same question everytime ""Is Dr. Destroyer back yet?"" The answer is always no. I ask about destroyer because of the next issue3. The villains are forgetable. I played the game rather extensivly from year 1. I even got a cape for it. But I can't think of any villains in this game that stood out to me besides Destroyer... and thats only because he is considered the big bad guy... that died before the game came out. Everyone else is trying to live up to his legacy or claim to be his disciple, or spout that he is gonna return. Hell even if he has come back I have download and played the game and asked in chat... the community doesn't even know. The dude is on the freaken game art... either i was being trolled or its just as they said and they don't know. Or they don't care to know.4. Your secret base is really nothing special. You can customize it a bit but out side of that it doesn't grant you any benefits beyond being a place to easily change your outfit with out having to run to a main city. And even then it still cost the same amount of cash. Then again i think there is item storage in your base so that is a plus.5.There is no real reason to play any of the in game story missions. If you are someone who doesn't care about the back ground of a game and simply want to get to the end so you can be top tear then play the first few missions till you get to level 10 and then stand in one spot and grind bank robber missions till you get to end game. You literally never have to leave the first city.6. Last time i played end game it was vs Gravatar... who was some Magneto chic that was curb stomping the entire game community because the gameplay leading up to the fight was so bad no one knew how to honestly play on a team. If you were new to the fight you would find out (after dying 3 seconds into the fight) that you don't respawn. You get locked in a ""safe zone"" box until you team won [never saw or heard about it happening] or everyone died. I also think the fight was timed. I don't know. I took L's so fast I never even understand what her attacks were. And the few people that did know so info were yelling in chat like the Pawn legion from dragons dogma. Repeating stuff knwon one had heard of or cared about because up until that point the game was ""throw on you most fancy looking outfits, strut around the main city hub trying to look kewl, and spam over powered attacks at enemies in missions""And even after all that... Champions Online is the best Hero MMO on PC.",0

2271,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewA long time player I never felt the game was grindy.

6715,Neverwinter,2015.0,"I was very surprised with this game. Great visual, great play and very interesting without paying. Playing with friends or alone, it's so much fun that hours will fly by and that is what is all about.I see lots of negative reviews lately. Thing is that servers are realy bad, lots of bugs and lagg. Im playing this game long time, and been playing since mod 5. Players complaining that this is grinding game, well, you have 2 options - spend real money or time.And then, when you collect gear come new mod and you have to go from beggining, thats not true, you can play with gear you have. Only thing you need is good build for your character. New mod or gear is added for us, to have new things to do. It is actually good thing.You also have to find good guild, and play with them, that way you can avoid pugs and all bad that come with that.",1

Somewhat of a throwback to Smash Bros.Pros: -fun to play with friends (like everything else)-small learning curve, however the skill gap is HUGE-Community is mostly decent.  Some people get very salty (like myself)-Its free and takes up very little spaceCons:-the hitboxes/hurtboxes will make you want to tear your hair out-Im not sure if its my internet or what...but the game seems like it has some input lag almost.

3580,Magic Duels,2015.0,"Just play Hearthstone. Programmers of this game are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥; AI cheats. They know what your top card is at all time and WILL play acordingly. You get mana screw of flood nearly everygame in storymode becasue the prebuilt decks suck balls (young pyromancer in a deck with 5 instants or sorceries),etc. Only saving grace is the ability to build your own decks and they ♥♥♥♥ed that up too. The only thing you can do is play against AI, becasue in multiplayer when another player concedes, and they will concede rather than play out a lost game, the AI takes over and often due to cheating, will win, causing you to lose a game that your opponent conceded from. No chat in 2HG, etc. tldr: Just play Hearthstone.I'm making an addition to the ♥♥♥♥♥iness of this game. The UI is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥made for mobile on console peasants. It will routinely select the first option of a card if it has multiple activiated abilities such as planeswalkers and it will not ask you to confirm even if your mouse was squarely over a different activated ability. I lost a game due to this♥♥♥♥♥♥UI. Do not install this piece is♥♥♥♥♥♥software. If you are that die hard for virtual magic just get cockatrice for you f2p fix. I've never played it, but it CANNOT be worse than this. Save your time and ESPECIALLY if you do not heed this advice, save your money.

1580,theHunter Classic,2015.0,"I must say this is the best hunting game out there!Pros:pretty realisticgreat gfxa great varity of animals to hunt, weapons and gear to use. Cons:MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I understand its a F2P but the ONLY way to hunt anything fun is to pay for a sub for x amount of months, then depending on what you want to hunt you have to have certain weapons and/or gear to hunt them. This also costs money to get and a TON of it...... You can do objectives that gives you in game money, but this only buys you scents, lures, bait, pretty much consumables. In all honesty if you like hunting games this is the game for you as long as you have a good $50+ to spend on getting guns, clothing, calls, stands, sites/scopes. If you don't have any money to put into the game its not worth getting due to the fact you CAN'T hunt anything fun.",1

147,Fractured Space,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewFractured Space is a rare gem among Early Access/Alpha games, in that it has both replayability and enjoyable gameplay. At its core, it's a lane-based capital ship MOBA, with a combination of great graphics and interesting ships. Each ship is very different in how it plays, and (right now) it doesn't take much work to get a new one. The devs add new ships with every update, along with other features, helping keep the game fresh.Coming from Counterstrike, I was impressed at the amount of teamplay already necessary to win, even if everyone only uses the text chat. Teamwork makes the difference between victory and defeat, and as the community is pretty small still, you will often run into the same players multiple times in a playsession.As an alpha, the gameplay is very well done, but other parts of the overall experience are lacking. It is difficult to play with a group of friends, as there is no party or matchmaking (yet), and the main menu buttons are sometimes clunky. This is certainly made up for by the quality of the gameplay, which is the most important aspect of a game anyways.Overall, Fractured Space is a game I would suggest to people who enjoy MOBAs or space sims, but it's a good enough game anyone can try it out.",1

1294,Star Trek Online,2016.0,When I first saw this game I was like ok lets give it a go. Well after giving it a go I have to say they have and still are doing a great job. There tons to do even if you reach the max level you still get points to spend on your character which is cool. The daily events also help getting rare and important equipment. There are alot of fan made missions as well just in case you want to take a break from the main missions and if you are stuck then other players if you ask will be there to help but the mission will get tougher with the more players in the mission. Also if you like clans then there are more then a few to join. My dislike is that when playing as UFP that sometimes you have to do some past missions you already done just to level up to the level that it wants you to be to carry on in the game which was a let down. But other then that its the best Star trek Game yet and it gets better with friends.,1

Another fun part about dungeons is people spawn kill you as you leave it. Day 2 more of the same crap.Day 3 My ranger made it to 45 and +5 all my gear and got one shot by a level 30 mage player.Day 4 went to a level 28 PVE area and farmed items to level my gear.Day 5 They nerfed all classes and me and my level 45 mage friend were haveing trouble killing a LEVEL 28 mini boss.We would do 6 combo attacks and it barely touched the health of the mob.

Then tech tree get symplified(just a one straight line that every dumb could understand how to use it) Then you got rid of that at all and added damned crates!

I still hope that FreeJam will change the way they develope their product and think about their community as not a bunch of dumbs with a free money. Still hope.",0
7609,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewVery nice Game. Unless Clash Royale this Game is NOT p2w as some people claim.

Rather than complaining that you dont have specific Cards, you should look for a way to utilize your Cards and Masters.",1
2129,Digimon Masters Online,2017.0,"In the beginning this game was fun to play but after a while I got the feeling that I was not completly rewarded for the hours I put on this game. The RNG is incredibly horrible/low when you are grinding to get the materials you need or when you try to hatch a digimon, I had 10 Keramon Digieggs and around 500 data chips, which is needed to hatch digimon and it varies, in my case it was 8 data chips were used every time and you need to have minium 3 succesful tries to hatch a digimon.The controls are easy and I liked them. It is easy to move, attack and use items. This area I had no problem with and would like to other MMORPG use something like this. The HUD interface was alright I guess, but it looked a little outdated. If you are one of those that just play games with good graphics then this game is definetly not for you. The graphics look like a game from PS2, it is very childish and not detailed.Now about the quests, there are three types of quests, there is ""Main Quests"", ""Side Quests"" and ""Daily Quests"". After a few hours of gameplay I got lost and did not know which kind of quest I was doing. Sure they got a litlle box that tells which quest you can do, but it lacked information. If you decide to play, be prepared to the lack of information that will be in the quest description, I personally did not understand sometimes and had to ""google"" it.Due to the bad RNG in the game, at some point you might consider to buy a digimon that can be hatched with its worst or best stats. This pretty much ruined for me because I might not play as much as I did before.Short summary; childish graphics, bad RNG, good controls, variation of quest which is good so that you do not grind all the time and bad system on obtaining new digimon.",0

6354,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI don't see how this game has any less RNG than Hearthstone. 75 cards in a deck -> more incosistency in draws, plus mana flood/screw, which means it is not unusual to draw nothing but mana 5 turns in a row or don't draw a single creature in your aggro deck for 10 turns.If you are OK with watching your opponent play while you can't do anything because you got screwed on draws, this game is for you.It's a shame because it could have been so good.",0
13137,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewBrawl of Ages was the only Clash Royale type/ripoff/copycat game on steam and now, Minion Masters is here too, and quite frankly, this is better, funner, quirker (sorry $2) AND at the current moment, has a playerbase. If you enjoy the Clash Royale type of games but got sick and tired of Clash Royale itself like me, but also dont want to play the other ones on the mobile that are arguably better than Clash Royale itself (such as Warzone: Clash of Generals, Titanfall something which might aswell be the best one at the moment and Chaos League, all better than CY itself) then this is the game for you, right now, and always. Has great humor (atleast with the spokeperson) has great design in sound, art, graphics, characters or minions as you call them (albeit i dunno whats the deal with Scrats but that and some other characters like Succubus still leaves some some to be desired, the squeaks though...feels bad listening and how useless the poor little fellas are...) but are mostly quite well made, the graphics are great, i love the physics to everything when they die, even the masters on towers fall down which is realy nice, gore is great and not too exagurated, and the masters themselves have a whole lot of personality, VOICED personality i might add albeit i wish they talked more as they sound quirky (atleast the Lighting guy), than other games of the genre, look great to look at, multiple ones with multiple strategies sure make it interesting to pick one from the bunch avaivable, the new mechanics such as the bridges giving xp for perks is great, musics and soundtracks are great, the game is very, very generous with the free stuff it gives aswell as the devs personaly themselves who keep this updated with new content reguarly often alot, its realy, realy fun and enjoyable to play, you have multiple varying modes to play in (even an upcoming single player map adventuring which is gonna be a first!), leagues, rewards, daily quests, no crappy chests you gotta wait hours on, albeit there is no minion/card upgrading like the other games have (not sure if its needed or not), and balance health wise might need more improvements, but the game's lore is neat, it isnt tied to anything albeit maybe just the future or something? So you get to see all kinds of wacky minions, medieval, fantasy, futuristic, etc. (kinda like Chaos League), and just like other games of its kind, you make multiple decks, synergize, use 3 same cards of one specific card 2 cards of 2 other cards, build up a winning streak to advance faster, made by the guys who made the FORCED games (which saddly i have not played but always known of their existance with their striking name), you can even buy different arenas for your side of the arena, which is better than being tied to the league arenas like in the other games, but one of the best parts comparing to those games, this game has horrible less unit/character/minion copies of other games and has far more completly unique made up minions that dont copy those from other games, it still has some like the Living Statue, Pulse Marines, etc. but not nearly enough for it to feel that way, which is awesome, its a realy great game, realy fun, realy good looking and sounding for the most part and its looking like its only going to get better, my only problem with the game is that i can only reset 1 daily quest per day and get quests involving playing with friends, while i have those, what i dont have is cooperation, willingness to play and i dont mean just me, so it would be nice to maybe get less of those? I dunno, not realy a huge deal breaker, i can get by it. Either way, love the game, keep up the great work ya all, i can wholesomely recommend this.''GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLL.    d.'' - funniest bit.",1

3668,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,"well.. I really enjoy the game.. the problem I have with it is:1.- I really hate cheaters.. I have a lot of game experience, so its easy for me to detect a cheater and I had been seeing cheater in about 30% of the gamesUsually aimbots and ESP (extrasensorial perception).. For example.. a plane that is aiming consistently against infantry while the fighter should not see the soldiers from the air and in the mid game he has +30 infantry killedNo matter if you hide in the bushes!!Or infantry who are killing everyone without even taking coverI think devs are doing their best against cheaters.. but I also think its not enought.. 1/3 of games infested by cheaters is too much!!The other problem I have is..2.- The nerfed PTRD 41.. It worths nothing!!I had been able to destroy tanks consistently from a range of 5-10 meters.. But.. whats the matter to get so close with a very restricted weapon of 1 shot, where you need to hit 3-4 times to destroy a light tank when there you can use antitank grenades wich only takes 2 equipments slot while the ptrd takes 8??  Absurd!!If you shot from 50-100 meters its almost sure you'll miss, no matter if you are proned.The PTRD 41 is a very long weapon with a very big and heavy ammo so it should have a very decent accuracy, but for now this weapon worth nothing.. in fact.. the AT grenades are a lot more efficient than this suposed  AT rifle..3.- Whats really the problem with Reto-Moto?..The problem is that the rich boys that plays for america are continuosly complaining about this and other weapons and reto-moto is so eager to please them..Thats the reason why americans win almost 90% of the wars!!!.

Bad updates, very very bad support - (No Email support aparently)The game is ruined in my opinion. They removed all the fun. Grinding is no longer a thing of what it seems like.

A bunch of scammers is what they are.Robocraft is no more. The ""new"" Robocraft is hilariously bad. I played this game back when Freejam was on fire and did a very good job of development. However. All this changed. Freejam is now basicly milking every single drop of money they can before this game will die.Freejam, if you see this. Give me my money back.

9888,Paladins®,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI'd recommend Paladins as a casual game which takes approximately 10 - 15 minutes per match. It's kinda fun and easy to understand, plus, the system requirement isn't too high.If you're good at FPS game this is gonna be easy for you, but I can play it just fine even I'm a girl. There are 4 types of champions to choose and each champion has his / her unique special skills or abilities. You can also buy special ability like increasing damage or life steal etc. with the credit you've earned that match (starting with 400 credits at the beginning of the match). To win the game, you have to push or resist the payload which will give you points. The team with 4 points win the match. Eazy breezy!Anyway, the only problem I've been facing almost every day is that the game kicked me out so often (some days not at all) due to unstable server, I guess. Some people have encountered the same problem too as I've seen on the bug report forum.Overall, this is a nice casual game and it's free!!

15550,Neverwinter,2013.0,"This review is based on approximately 3 hours of interupted game-play.  Considering it is free to play I'll be cautious about my reservations about this game, so here goes:Uber:-  Decent selection of character races & classes-  Has a glowing-sparkly trail of prettiness that you can choose to show which leads you to your next objective-  Fast sense of progression, your character obtains new skills and abilities regularly which keeps it interesting-  Some ability graphics look really goodMeh-  Physics graphics are cheesy - players run with an odd motion-  Interacting with objects or NPC's can be tedious as you need to 'interact' with F key which can be buggyJust....no-  Very linear when not in town - always a set path-  Early level game mechanics are highly favourable to the player (overpowered) and although that can be fun sometimes I found it made the beginning of the game bat-turd boring. Overall it seems to be trying to follow the game play mechanics of World of Warcraft but without the cartoon graphics.  As an avid Dungeons & Dragon's fan I was hoping for more with character creation but I appreciate how it can become daunting if over complicated.Overall it's a decent free to play game but I wouldn't spend money on it.",1

Otherwise, this game is UTTER GARBAGE.The matchmaking is so broken that I can't even describe it. Even if it might seem balanced, you only get to play a ""balanced"" game 1 every 20-30 games, and even then there's a pretty high chance you'll end up with one of the following people: a retard, a russian who doesn't speak english, a troll, a hacker.The rest of the games are either 16:1 in your favor, or 1:16 against you. And trust me, the ones you lose with scores like 10:16 are the worst games, cause this game TRULY gets the best out of you. For instance, if you play for about 3 hours CS, you'll need around 4 to let the tension this game creates blow off. It's unreal!

12187,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"I've already spent almost 100 hours playing this game on the Windows Store, and I have to say that it's one hell of a time waster. Fallout Shelter doesn't have any specific goal in mind, so you can spend your spare time increasing your vault's population (and have your own Gary-themed whacko-fest); training your dwellers' SPECIAL stats for gameplay bonuses; or send them all out in the wasteland, and battle a dozen Deathclaws, for that chance to find a rare item - just remember to send them back to the vault if you're going to exit the game, because the timer keeps ticking even when you're out, and reviving a dead vault dweller costs a lot of caps. Tip for new players: a high food level keeps everyone happy and smiling in the face of danger; therefore, invest in it early in the game (or send the useless dwellers out to die in the wilderness), because it dwindles fast if you have too many people.Overall, a fun casual game. There are microtransactions available, but your vault can survive even without purchasing any of them. You might have to spend more time playing and managing if you want some of the loot that can be purchased in the store, but a day or two of waiting wouldn't hurt.And there you have it.",1

14492,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI hate to be that guy that compares this to other games, but this game is like Black Ops 4, H1Z1, and PUBG had a child. That child then went to Harvard and got an MBA. Then the child then began to make his way up in the world easily surpasing his predececors and becoming a role model. On the real though, this game is so much more fun than all of the listed games above. I only have 6 hours at the moment but I am quickly racking them up as I was playing this game instead of writing an English 101 essay. Already my favorite game for sure. One thing that could definately change would be some of the physics. It rarely messes you up but sometimes it happens.",1
19761,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewStill in Early Access but I havent encountered any bugs with about 35 hours in so far. Eternal is very free-to-play friendly and it clearly draws alot of its economic model from Hearthstone. It is less simplistic and more reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering in terms of gameplay but keeps some of the more complex mechanics out which is great for players just looking to jump into the game.I recommend this to fans of the CCG model who seek something different from Heathstone and also want to avoid the low production value of many of the recent CCGs that I have found.,1

Hopefully by the time it comes out it'll have more in-depth character customisation. A more unique combat system and vastly improved map design. Seriously, the area's in this game are huge for some unknown reason and there is no sprint button either.

15079,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Do you think the game is p2w? This will probably change your minds.This is Darkon's post from the official TOS forums.UPDATED Hair Accessory Enchantment Odds and Pricestl;dr: Cost to enchant a Hair Accessory with the exact 3 stats of your choice? $9,709.20 USD per Hair Accessory. Do you want specifically HP, SP, and Crit Damage all at perfect rolls? $5,126,457.60 USD per Hair Accessory. If you only care about getting AOE Ratio, regardless of any other stat on the item, it is only about $13.68. If you only care about a perfect PATK, and don't mind anything else, it would be $327.60 USD.Edit: Post is for educational purposes only. I can't really take one side or the other anymore because the existence of the item may open pandora's box, or it may end here in its current form. I don't know. Hopefully this helps in your decision about how you feel about Magic Scrolls and the possibility of other RNG benefits IMC may introduce. All RNG formulated with an assumed (until proven otherwise) equal weighting. nizidr helped me realize there are multiple attribute types dealing with elemental damage, and possibly defense, that can stack on the same item. All odds updated from base 1:19 stats to 1:31 (1-17 stats remain the same, 18 Attribute Defense updated to 18-Holy 19-Dark 20-Fire 21-Lightning 22-Earth 23-Ice 24-Poison, 25 Attribute attack split into 25-Holy 26-Dark 27-Fire 28-Lightning 29-Earth 30-Ice 31-Poison) due to previous stats allowing multiple rolls from the same pool of options for those stats only. Appending the 1:19 values at the end for reference.Firstly, as per IMC, 100TP = approx $9.00. From that we can discern that 1 TP = approx 9 cents and 8 TP (cost of Magic Scroll) = approx 72 cents.So.. want to see the odds of getting the perfect 3 stats on your hair accessory using the Magic Scroll that IMC talked about?In KToS there are 19 possible stats. Yes, this could change, but since they have confirmed the scroll coming to IToS we'll just have to use these numbers from KToS for now.19 total stats to choose from and each scroll use has a chance to enchant either 1 stat, 2 stats, or 3 stats. However stat 18 and 19 have 7 sub-rolls each to account for Elemental Attack and Elemental Defense to a specific element. It also appears that while multiple elements can be rolled on to the same piece that no piece displayed thus far has two of the same elemental properties (i.e. a hat may have +Fire Attack, +Ice Attack, +Holy Attack, but not +Fire Attack, +Fire Attack, +Fire Attack) so this is incorporated into the equations at 1:31.To get our wanted 3 stat types we'd take 31*30*29=26970, but, that is for sequential odds, and our stat order doesn't matter (HP,SP,CRIT is the same as CRIT, HP, SP for instance). If we give each of the three stats a number we'll see there are 6 combinations:123132213231312321So we're taking 26970/6 to give us 1:4495, but since we can either roll a single stat, 2 stats, or 3 stats we multiply 4495 by 3 to get the final odds of achieving our ideal 3 stat types on our item at 1:13485.For our costs we will simulate a faux 100% chance by saying if you rolled it that many times you will have been guaranteed the roll you want (even if we know this is not the case and you could re-roll hundreds of millions of times and still not get lucky).So for a 1:13485 chance, just to get your 3 stat types, not including if the stat values are even high, you're looking at approximately $9,709.20 USD For one piece. $29,127.60 USD for all three pieces.Going forward...Most stats have a variance in what their values can be. For instance, PATK has a range between 21 and 45. 45-21=24, so there are a total of 24 different possibilities for the PATK stat to be. In this example, we'll say you don't even care what value the other two stats are and all that matters to you is having those stats plus a perfect PATK roll.1:13485 for the 3 stats you want, but we're going to multiply that by 24 since 1:13485 is just the odds of getting all three stats at any random value. So to get a perf PATK and any value for the 2 other stats you want it is 1:323640.Or, in translation, that roll is worth $233,020.80 USD in the cost of Magic Scrolls.Now, a step further. What if you didn't care about the other stats at all and only want a perfect PATK value? This accounts for any random stats that accompany your wanted perfect stat of PATK, but also accepts the possibility you may not have any other stats on the item at all. To get this we first accept that the odds of getting PATK on a single stat roll are 1:31, but the odds for getting it on a double stat item are twice as good at 1:31/2 because there are now two possible stats on the item either of which that could be our PATK, and 1:31/3 for a triple stat item. PATK has a variance of 24 so we are looking at (1:31*24 + 1:31*24/2 + 1:31*24/3)/3 or (1:744 + 1:372 + 1:248)/3 which gives us 1:455, or $327.60 USD. Sounds more reasonable, possibly scarily so.And if you only want, say, AOE Ratio? Well, that stat has no variance, and is locked at 1, so you are very likely to get it on your item with (1:31*1 + 1:31*1/2 + 1:31*1/3)/3 giving us roughly 1:19 or approximately $13.68 USD. The chances of getting a really good stat like AOE Ratio, that is always by default locked at its perfect value, is very high.However, as per the example I listed in the other thread, let's say I want HP, SP, and Crit Damage, since these three stats have the highest possible variances. What are the odds of rolling perfect stats on all 3 of those on a single piece?HP: 383 to 803, 420 possible valuesSP: 76 to 150, 74 possible valuesCrit Damage: 32 to 66, 34 possible valuesGetting all 3 of those stat types is 1:13485, getting all 3 stat types with perfect HP is 1:5663700, with SP would be 1:997890, with Crit Damage 1:458490.. add those 3 since each is already its own perfect roll, so...1:7,120,080...That's roughly half chance of winning the lottery.You're more than 7 times as likely to be struck by lightning this year at 1:960,000.Neat.The cost of that perfect enchant? $5,126,457.60. Yep, that's over 5 million dollars in case you didn't know IMC, just a heads up lolAnd since we have 3 pieces we need to enchant.. better make sure they are all perfect yeah? I mean it will only cost you $15,379,372.80 USD.(Clarification edit: Please note the above figures are only for HP + SP + Crit Damage, as an example, because these three stats have the highest pool of potential values. This means this is the most difficult set of perfect stats to obtain. If you want, for example, a perfect PATK + a specific perfect Element attack + AOE Ratio, the odds would be 1:579,855 or $417,495.60 USD. Not that either cost is something we can realistically afford but it is important to note that the odds of getting your perfect 3 stat combination, all with perfect rolls, is highly dependent on the number of possible values that each stat can inherently have. The more values it can have the harder, and more expensive, it will be to get the best one.)Do you think its still pay to win? WIll anyone pay thousands of dollars to get a few stat advantages?",1
556,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewRefund completed.This game was packing allot of hype, its a stripped game of the other release in Korea and Japan, had to tweak the game .ini files to make the game playable in GTX 1080Ti .. had to config the game to run on 2560x1080 resolotion, still lags in town at some points.I have no problems buying the game again, if they did add all the end game content, I feel its useless to farm to level cap to face a brick wall to do nothing else.Should you buy? don't; not unless they add all the content. time will only tell.Devs.. work on it.recomended online games:- Black Desert Online - BDO- Kritika Online- Soulworker - Vidicuts - Warframe- Guildwars 2- Final Fantasy XIV- Dungeon Figher Online - 2D Scroll based game [old but fun]  ",0

(its basically HS adventures, but they are free and very story driven to fit into the lore of the entire game) All in all this is a fantastic game developed by people who clearly have a passion for and love what they are doing, intent on providing a free to play game to the community and a game that is skill based and RNG free.

Not Pay2Win (yet) and it would be even better if they could get the ship mechanics right.  Matchmaking needs abit of work, half the time you'll find yourself as a novice playing with/against the top players on the leaderboards.  But the core gameplay is decent and enjoyable.  If you enjoy bashing your head on your keyboard after a match, or if you ever wanted to play World of Tanks but in LoL, this is the game for you.My one main issue: The Devs want $30 worth of Platinum to buy one Premium Ship that is exactly the same as the original ship, just reskinned with a pitiful (10%) exp/credit booster.  That's three times what the game cost at release. god damn ridiculous.  For $30 I expect a hell of a lot more than a new skin and dinky exp/cred boost.Spoiler!

6013,Aura Kingdom,2014.0,"I put around 30 hours into this game, i must say that it is fun for the first 40-50 levels and the levelling is quick, i would say too quick really, there is no tangible story line and some of the higher quests are not really suitable for a character of that level, for example, one of the lvl 40 quests is to go and collect some mushrooms. This ques gives you enough XP to almost hit lvl 41. The main attraction of the end game is the Sky Tower, where on the weekend you can form parties and take the tower floor by floor as the bosses get harder and harder. Never before have i had to grind so hard on an mmo, the content cap is around lvl 62 and the max level is 75 currently.

11854,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2014.0,"I have played a lot of racing games in my time mostly on the various playstation sytems. Looking at the screenshots of the game and the trailers it looks quite something, when you download the game however things change. Firstly the 'Free to play' element is a 5 cars on a 5 tracks quite disappointing but it cost nothing. First thing that annoyed is the braking signs that  suggest that target audience is 3 year olds, colour coding? aren't the distance signs good enough for a simulator.Anyway, after starting an event in a stick shift I was quite pleased to see one hand went to change gear when required, my illusions were shattered when I came to a corner though. I pressed the right arrow key the steering wheel imediately went to full lock and I understeered into the wall so I thought fair enough I was a bit fast but I expected for the car to at least attempt the corner, (for example gran turismo you can enter a hairpin flat and you will take a curved path into the wall). I tried the next corner at a snail's pace (light sweeper probably a 3rd usually, I took it in 1st )giving an impovement, enough that I made it round. Something that bothers me is the fact it just says speed on the display is it km/h or mph? considering I was doing 190 in first in a DTM car I doubt it's either.Next I took a paddle shift prototype, the paddles did not move at the correct which also bothered me. Furthermore, the camera is positioned so close to the steering wheel that it seems the driver is trying to rub his chin on it. Next the sounds, it's free to play I know but I expected it least to sound like an actual race car as this was. tunnels make exhaust notes but the tunnel I entered was extremely underwhelming.All I can say is at least it wont cost you any money just time",0
18867,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"Not like any other clicking game, this game have different kind of ""Crusader"" in each event where you can get by completing its objective, so each time you restart you always have different kind of ""Crusader"" to play. It has even some buff or item for each of this ""Crusader"", so you don't have to restart at 0 but start at 5% of the journey, etc. Overall, it is a great game, but I like to state some of my disappointment. Firstly it is  REALLY HARD for a new player, why ? You start off with no buff, no item, no special crusader, etc. And if you wanna get some of those things (Buff,Item,etc) you need to spend a lot of money to get those things in the treasure.

5883,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"Take this into considerations before you even put any time into this game; It's reviews are mixed. If that isnt enough to turn you away from this game, than I'll delve deeper.The Trailers are the greatest part of this game, It makes up for the game's lack of in-game music. Grinding takes forever in terms of EXP to earn your next weapon, and credits to buy your next weapon.This game is Pay to Lazy, not Pay to win. Everything in the game can be unlocked with in-game currency without ever having put a penny into it. However, these pay to lazy prices are absurd, ranging in the 100s.The community is absolutely horrendus. Alongside the forums, there has had to be major censoring on all three factions, in the game. You will see a lack of sportsmanship.Due to the game's lack of combined arms, You'll be out of luck if you thought this game would be where you can renact your favorite FURY scene where Brad Pitt fires an Stg. 44 at a German from an M4A2E8 Sherman. You will never be able to spawn with a Mosin Nagant as a German or vice versa.The Developers take YEARS to respond to certain kinds of feedback, Reto displays heavy examples of Selective listening where certain factions recieve more or less attention due to their paying playerbase. It has taken YEARS for a glitch in Plane dogfighting in which one pilot could instant-kill the other without damaging their plane.I will probably be banned if the Reto community manager sees this. Because like many others, People have been banned for giving this game a review it truly deserves. However, I'm fine with this. The Heroes and Generals that I started playing two years ago has radically changed. And will continue to change.If you still decide to play this game.

Your supplies are very limmited unless you gain experiece or pay. The time it takes to gain a significant amout of experience is just like real fishing. I'd rather spend that amount of time on a game the is more engaging.,0
5915,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"This guy,""Endurance"", said everything:""I have a level 230 Shinobi, and a Pardoner/Buffer thats aiming to become an Oracle someday.. i'll give you my thoughts about this game:Tree of Savior is being runned by a publisher called IMCIMC made some pretty dumb decisions on how to handle RMT & Gold Farmers, they've put restrictions on almost everything, while RMT are still trading talt to their buyers and those players sell it to npc for 5k each, every other legit suffers from marketplace queues and trade restrictionsThe game is very poorly optimized even on high end PC's.. its funny because there was no performance issues during iCBT.. this all started to happen after they do a maintenence and it gets worst everytime they do itWe've got a few elitist f&%kers camping Dullahan and other popular world bosses to farm cubes, yes just a party of 6 ~ 12 people and they pretty much own the market, things that people want to buy are not listed on the marketplace and nobody is selling because they aim on inflating everything via high demand.. which seems to be working very well for themThere are many cool community made addons that wasnt officially approved by IMC yet, and TOS is a VAC enabled game.. lately i've been seeing top 10 players disappearing from the rankings and nobody knows whyDungeons are always bugged, either theres a problem queueing due to a large influx of players doing the same thing, you would get booted to the login screen over and over until you finally get in, IMC have given some decent compensation for it over the past few weeks, but after the recent 24 hour (yes one full day) maintenence, nobody has recieved compensation at all!I'm not new to the MMO scene, I played pretty much every game out there for nearly two decades.. One of my favorite things about it is the International community, everyone speaks different languages, everyone has a different grind, a different strategy on doing things.. Tree of Savior has the most toxic, most racist playerbase i've ever seen!They pretty much runned the Brazilian players off the server! Some are to blame for recent exploiting, but others were really nice.. anyway they're all gone now. IMC moved them to a different server and there goes 1/3 of my friends list, the few that are left are being automatically blocked due to some bug after the previous maintenence, so I currently have nomore friends.I'm writing this here because I wanted to write about it at the forums, but I'm constantly getting 404 errors or the forums would not load at all.. yeah i'm getting tired of this game and it hasn't even fully launched yetAlready bought the expansion to Guild Wars II and thats where i'm going.So to anybody thats waiting on this game, or dying to play it.. don't get your hopes up its gonna be a big waste of time and disappointment, no doubt the game will be overrun by gold spammers and botters once its F2P""",0

Good ol' AQ style.But seriously. I spent 17 hours getting to level 8. That would take about two hours or more for a normal MMORPG. The quests are nice and interesting (even if most are just kill this kill that 100 times).And the jokes are decent and funny for the age group this is generally targeted at.But seriously, all in all  I would say its a good 8/10 in the MMORPG community.It definitely has great potential and may come to be one of the best 3D MMORPG I have ever seen.

5844,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2018.0,"Been playing this game for a while. New update: Pro- Gameplay is still the same- Load time improved (lost quality of detail - likely so it would load faster on tablets)Cons- Animations seem like a rookie studio made them- Sound effects are horrible now, nothing like it used to be- Animations are laggy- Card art has lost quality, having the borders removed seems like an odd choice.- Interface looks dingy, looks like an old school arcade game or something, the old interface had more character and feel.OverallThe update had graphical changes that were not for the better.  While they improved the loading time they sacrificed detail and quality.  Cards look ok, still nice looking though.  The biggest thing for me is the lag or delay during game play and the sound effects are terrible. I can live with graphical changes however, I hope they fix the lag and really improve the sound effects, they are horrible now. (When your main character gets hit, it used to make a nice BOOM noise... now it is a little whack noise... HORRIBLE) that is just an example.Game is still a great card game, hopefully this new studio can remediate the problems they are experiencing. ",1

Especially in the Single Player Mode. By the way: The Single Player is aweful as hell anyway. The dialogs are cringe-worthyly bad! And the AI is unfair as hell, having some seriously overpowered cards more than 3 times in their deck (3 being the maximum for the player). I can't tell of the multiplayer experience is any better, I highly hope it is, but I am not sure if I want to find out since at this point I am more willing to force a cactus into my butt than to play another minute of this game!

2371,Paladins®,2017.0,"I'm writing this at a time where I'm very...let down..by Paladins. OB64.Anyway, the pros... yeah, this was a fun kinda casual competetive hero shooter/moba. Overwatch clone? Sort of, but with enough identity to make it fun. Also the card system allowed for customization of your characters, much like the talent trees do in Heroes of the Storm.The grind was there, but overall I earned enough gold and essence to get the stuff I wanted. I also spent some real money on a few packs, and a few cosmetics. It was worth it.With OB64, they're essentially getting rid of casual queue, the one that most players play. They are changing the card system to introduce a *huge* grind wall, or you're forced to pay literally $1000+ to level your cards up to 5 by getting a crazy amount of duplicates from lootboxes.If your cards aren't level 5, you're screwed. You'll get stomped without any real chance to fight back. An example:Your Bob, his punch deals 500 damage with the level 1 card.The enemy Bob, his punch deals 2500 damage with a level 5 card.You struggle to deal damage. Enemy hits you twice and you're dead.Bob has 2000 health by default with a level 1 card.Enemy Bob has the card at level 5, boosting his health to 5000.In short: There's no more balance. It's ruined. They created an unfair playing field. Casual/Quick Play queue is extremely crap and frustrating to play now. Ranked isn't for everyone, and even if you play it, all cards are level 3, no exception. More fair, but doesn't really offer any balance either.Devs have said they *will* push this patch on december 13th.My thoughts? With the extremely negative reception of this patch, I foresee many players leaving, or playing less. It looks to me like they want to end this game, and make as much last ditch effort money off it as they can, right near the holidays. Overall, Paladins seems to be going the way of Tribes: Ascend and Global Agenda, two other now-dead HiRez games. They registered a new IP for a sort of PUBG clone. We'll see if that'll work, I guess.I dunno if the devs really want this change, or if the management is pushing this through. Either way, it's going to happen. Also, it's useless to voice your concern about it to the devs. It usually gets ignored. Heck, my post offering constructive criticism and suggestions on alternative ways to handle these changes were deleted for no reason at all. It was not offensive, not one bit. And yet, that gets deleted. I made a post about my post getting deleted: Also removed within 5 minutes. -.- If that's how kind concerned players are being treated, then forget it. Let your game die, then. >.>My advice: Don't spend money on Paladins. Don't even bother playing it. It's sad, because I genuinely enjoyed the game, despite the many bugs. I would recommend you at least try it, if it wasn't going in this direction. I'd say..wait at least 'till summer 2018 to see how it has survived. I myself will be keeping an eye on it from a distance. But the Paladins team has lost my trust, and my respect, with both the game changes and their treatment of my offered assistance.If you *really* want to play a PvP focused MOBA-ish game by HiRez, play Smite. It's been out of beta for years and relatively stable and played by millions. I've certainly enjoyed it since I started playing, and I'm nearing my third year of playing Smite. It's not perfect, but it's heading in a better direction than Paladins.So sadly, no, I can't recommend this game to anyone. Not unless they fix all the crap they're breaking with OB64. No more lootboxes. No more grind2win or pay2win. No more unfair playing field. Fix the bugs. The random ending of matches, to name one. Or the voice/chat mute buttons no longer working. And a plethora of others.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update July 2018:Well, they sort of saw OB64's negative impact and changed it. Reverted back to the old card system. That's good. They removed Payload maps. Now you can only play Siege and Deathmatch. Wait wat? Where's Onslaught, the king-of-the-hill mode? Oh, it's *in* the Deathmatch queue. Yeah. The two modes are combined in one queue. So over half the time you'll play Deathmatch (on the only DM map available) when you really wanted Onslaught. Why? This is such a stupid decision.I've tried out some practice stuff after this and...I guess it's fine. The only match I played went horribly so I can't really comment too much on the state of the game. But I'll say this:Don't be fooled by Paladins suddenly no longer being in beta. The game is still very much beta. They had to remove the beta tag for the Nintendo Switch release since Nintendo doesn't allow beta games on their platform. There's so much they still have to fix, and they never really do, anytime soon or at all. They changed the main screen to mimic Overwatch's quite directly. They haven't finished all the loading screen cards, to mimic Smite's loading screen.I dunno, there's so much wrong...I'm sure it's playable to a degree, but.. sigh.. this game's already lost my trust and my respect. I could technically play a little here and there, but I'm no longer motivated to invest as much time in it as I used to. Or at all, really.I'll just stick with Smite. It's far from perfect, but I have more faith in it, as well as its continued evolution. So far it hasn't pulled a horrible move like OB64.",0

I'd say they did a good job recreating dueling from the card game, it's pretty fun when it's against normal decks. But it's ruined by meta/pay2win decks, if you play PvP 9/10 duels will be against meta decks. If you want to get good cards, you either have to buy them or farm for hours to get them. In the events you just fight the same opponents over and over which just shows that the devs are lazy. The game was ported from phones so the sides of the screen are just to fill space with basically useless information. I wouldn't recommend this game, it's only fun the first few hours when you're buying cards and trying them out, after that you just farm with the same cards for a long time until you get enought gems to buy other cards.

Single play feels like any card game you need to have a perfect build and hope the other dont have the counter deck or a better pick. So the team mode is the only option if you want a random win/lose and not a paymyway dude before you. Even if you have the best deck or cards. The other one can have ****** the worst cards you can think of. And so you lose. This mode fits my game style. I do not like playing the ""perfect mode"" like all games in this style.

6625,DCS World Steam Edition,2018.0,17 hours into it.Overall I’m happy with it. One of the big things about it is that there is a big learning curve but once your past  that  it is a very fun game so as long as you can have some patients. The tutorial needs some work. It is not always clear with its directions and some arrows pointing to things would be nice since it just describes what things look like in the cockpit. There are some things that they describe that fit multiple things. The controls can take getting use to but after a while its fine for the most part but there are a lot of controls and finding a part of controls can be difficult sometimes. Another compliant I have is I feel that a lot of the prices for DLC should be lower or to at least bundle more things. I found out they raised some prices earlier this summer by $10 and even $20. The original prices were more reasonable. My finale complaint is it crashes more than it probably should. I have a decent computer that can run it at a consistent 60FPS  on low and medium graphics. The freezes seem to come out of nowhere. I also had some low fps and freezes that happened for a short time when firing weapons but this for some reason  doesn’t happen anymore.  At the moment a 7/10 ,1

If you are going to release a game, shouldn't it work at least 90% of the time? And the bugs arent things you can play through, they are fatal errors that force you to close and re-open the game.

It got popular when it went to early access and recieved generally positive feedback.Even though champions and maps were somehow limited ,( well, it was ealy access anyway ), the gameplay was exciting and fun.Now, what happened. As many other games ( free ones mostly ), the developers focused their attention on ingame micro transcations, floeded the game with skins ( A lot which are ugly or just a recolor) . Don't get me wrong, they have done many bug fixing but it was obivious that they want to grind the game with more and more skins. Note* : skins are only cosmectic, and therefore has no effect on gameplay.Now to a more serious part. The high rez app is totally trash. They force you to install when downloading paladins. (why the hell does steam exist ? ) .The more funny thing is that  it leaves services active in your pc after uninstall (hilarous).Not to forget they are using now Easy Anti-Cheat.

9384,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI enjoy this card game... which makes it weird that I also hate it.First what's good;It's not as overbearing as magic in scale and entertaining enough to have me spend some time on it daily. I enjoy the league concept very much but it's a week's gold income to buy in if you pony up and play consistently. Leaving little left over for the only fun mode they have, the draft. And finally, the reason I hate this game and won't ever recomend it or say really anything kind about it is THERE IS NO PRICE BREAK FOR BUYING MORE! there is NO difference between the lower amounts of gems and the higher ones. Meticulously designed to give the illusion that purchasing more will give you more, whilst actually they're f***ing people. The gems you do get? ITS HOTDOGS TO BUNS B*** ***T. Always a little in pocket so you can PAY more or WASTE some. 3 Legendaries Gaurenteed! Or what they don't tell you: THEY ROBBED 3 OF YOUR RARES REPLACED THEM AND STUCK A NOTE ON YOUR BACK SAYING ""KICK ME, I'M STUPID""ALL THE CONS:UTTER PAY TO WIN TRASH. Many people with similiar complaints that simply are not being addressed. Getting legendaries is a long brutal grind. The gem return is the worst I will bother to play, don't listen to some of these fake reviews, you get about .0001% of investment if you delete cards. The daily's are much lacking, they barely can be considered better than other TCG's because it's actually not, it's the same garbarge ideas with 0 originality. ""win 3 with a yellow, get a box, then **** off and stop playing because you're out of gold, forge is stupid, and the ladder is crawling with people that spent more money than you. Legendaries are way OP some of them straight up brokenly powerful. That's a bad combination which breeds pay to win. Of course this dumpster fire of what could be good is just that, only worth what your wallet poops into this toilet. I feel like the reason this game is actually a throw away is because nobody working on it actually plays it like a customer. Doesn't see it like someone trying to play fun TCG without much money. A COMPLETE LACK OF EMPATHY. Like most corperate shills. Money over quality. Listen to what people are complaining about and adress it, we don't pay you to be stupid, as a matter of a fact i stopped paying you after my first purchase and wish I could stop paying you twice. How do you actually not have a price break for paying more. Disgusting. It's so stupid, I can't even, it HURTS MY HEAD. It MIGHT be worth spending money on, if there was ANYTHING to gain by actually putting more than 2.99 for your 3 free packs of each new set.",0
2444,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewGameplay is not fluid and feels choppy even after following reddit ini files tweak guide. Textures and models pop up on my screen every 10 feet, walking around feels very unnatural and weird. Kinda kills the immersion.Graphics are completely outdated, a lot of mobile games look better than Bless Online, and this is coming from someone who maxed all graphics settings. Shame, really.Servers are very unstable, Habbich went offline for a couple minutes without prior notice, it was very frustrating. Poor translation is still there, I was stuck on a quest for 15 minutes trying to figure out what it wanted me to do. The quest description didnt make any sense to begin with, it is like nobody proof read it before implementing.Considering this is a 7 year old game, I wasn't expecting an incomplete release full of bugs and optimization problems. I rate it 2/10",0
13872,Fishing Planet,2016.0,"Early Access Review2nd EDIT: After recent patch 3.3 that went live 12th March, I can say that game i enjoy playing this game once again. They have  turned down fish IQ, and they are not able to snag the line anymore. It's turned off until they figure out proper way to do it. Gear still wasn't updated and everyone will find leveling a bit harder because the lack of gear required. One of the examples is lvl 19 casting rod ""Galaxycast"" that requires lure weight to be minimum 100g. That was obvious typo, and game suffers for it, since you can't really use that rod. Main flaw of the whole update is that devs cranked up the difficulty but haven't provided players with adequate new or updated gear.I still have high hopes for this game.Back from my previous rating when i gave this game 3/10 (post patch) from 9/10 (pre patch), I am now giving this game rating of 6/9 since they have made it playable again. I have my hopes up this will not become ""freemium"" game.For those who wish to read my review of the patch 3.0 and my thoughts on it, you can find my rant below. :)tl;dr - I explain the reasons why they screwed the last update, and how it hurt the game and community.__________________________________________________________________________________EDIT:Apparently, only their patch notes are really lame. Thing is, you need to match your gear exactly to the weight (or better) of the fish you are going for. My main problem was that the game was lying to me. A bit about the line not fitting reel. If reel says its 0.28, just mount it even if you get warning that it may damage your reel. If you have reel that is even the slightest lower than the fish you are catching you WILL break your gear, and damage it fast. If your full gear matches the fish spec, you will have same experience as before. It WILL become enjoyable again. I will be leaving this negative review tho, since the patch notes are TRASH and i had to spend over 10k and 100g to figure this out.__________________________________________________________________________________There are tons of reasons to love this game. Excellent community, gorgeous scenery, sound effects (tho some peckers and wolves can be annoying at times) the feeling when you are fishing them sometimes ""feels"" like real fishing. BUT...Reason why i'm even writing this, is because i have spent very much of my spare time on this, and after most recent update, i  had a feeling i have to go and put my 2 cents here. Update is almost perfect. While they were trying to go for feel that would be as much realistic as it can get, somewhere they lost themselves. It has supposed to be tougher for players. To make fish smarter, to make gear have durability, and to make you use your gear as you would do in real life, instead of just straight reeling fish in. Well I said they got lost, because when they went for smart fish, they got smart as Albert Einstein with street smarts and strength of a superman. You can have all proper gear suited for the fish that you are trying to catch, but fish will just glance around see some rocks or weeds, make a run for it, forgetting the fact that it is in much pain and agony get boost of strength and swim 15m in opposite direction, hiding behind those rocks, then tie some super knot around one of those rocks, snag your line, get the hook out if it's mouth and just laugh at you for being a dunce compared to her smarts. Now for the gear wear/tear part. Everything gets destroyed. Your jacket, your bags, lures, lines rods and reels. I'm guessing the undies get worn too. Now, it wouldn't be much of a problem if that would take some time, but alas it is not. Your gear lasts you for 30-40 fish max, then you need to repair it (if you manage to fix it, since reels once snagged by fish at max length because of their superman strength, your reel gets broken full since you can't break line unless prompted, and game doesn't offer you that option. Broke 6 reels trying to fish in California (where i am supposed to fish for my level). At the moment i'm stuck in leveling because i should be fishing in Cali, but my gear (that's the only thing that crossed my mind) is not good enough for that fish. But if i would go anywhere else to fish, i would need to grind another year, since i'm getting 10 times less XP on some other places. For example for rainbow trouts i'm getting 35xp and i need 20.000 xp to my next level. Fishing technique: They did almost flawless job. You need to fish just as you would reel in real fish. You need to tire it out with same techniques that you would use in real life. But again, their smarts and superman strength are sometimes ruining (quite often) the experience. I'm using correct and updated skill (fishing as if i would in real life with tiring the fish), but somehow they always are able to go over my max line distance and break my reels. And anyways, i've got gear at my place that is older than 30 years and still works same as the day it was bought.Now there are also some gear issues that don't make sense to me.  I guess either i'm not right in my assumption, or somehow they missed one thing. I am using  spinning reel Exterminator 5500 for example. As it says on it, it supports 0.28 braided line. Well, it wont support it, and not even 0.23 one. So, how about you fix this ASAP.... game mechanics are a gem. but fish is 3 times stronger than it actually is, gets bursts of power that allow them to swim 40m in opposite direction, and you just can't do nothing. Just sit and watch as it destroys your gear, even tho, your reel in reality should easily handle that fish weight.This game is going FREEMIUM and i think they wont turn away from that idea, since there is already DLC package that you can buy. That dlc includes gear that will be usable for ANY fish. And there is no way to obtain that gear in any other way.YOU NEED FIXES TO THIS UPDATE ASAP, or this is going to end badly with you loosing gamers.",1
5528,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2018.0,"Generally The Elder Scrolls: Legends (TESL) is a fun, well balanced game focused on creature combat. Coming from Hearthstone, TESL has a lot more potential thanks to not limiting it's card design to single click effects, and not overusing RNG effects. The unique aspects of the game are two lanes and the rune mechanics, which give creature combat depth and they give the defending side better comeback chances. While the game isn't the most popular card game out there, the playerbase and community are certainly healthy enough to have fun with. The economy is certainly very generous compared to hearthstone, and after playing on and off for 6 months F2P I have a nearly all the important cards. The game recently swithed developers who made a completely new client, which was released too early. It was originally buggy, but good patching has fixed it and the game runs and looks great now. The new devs are actively adding features and content to the game, and Bethesda is not giving up on the game any time soon after pumping money into the game with the developer switch. Overall, its free to play, give it a try. Maybe you'll like it.",1
4585,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,"Its an alright game.Keep in mind this is very pay to win, if someone wants they can send a BFG before they are even supposed to be able to send one and thats GG for you 90 percent of the time. Even if you have a better eco and more tower upgrades.Also in card battles someone can buy cards that are very OP.Its also extremely pay to boost, you can literally buy anything someone spent countless hours trying to get. And upgrades are absolutely a neccessity and they are also buyable. There are also many severe imballances for instance a fully upgraded tack shooter that shoots fire is way more powerful than a fully upgraded spike tower. Though even after the PTW system its still very fun. It gets boring fast though when you see someone sends a BFG when you cant even send one yourself yet or when someone fully upgrades their tack tower and thats pretty much stopping everything you throw at them when you have 9 towers fully maxed out to just their 3 with only 1 fully maxed.

2141,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,"this game is a thing, but the balance is horrible and anti- german bias is blatantly evident by the devs. why is the M2 carbine even in the game since it was so rediculously uncommon during ww2? why do all the american carbines use 30 rd mags instead of the infinitely more common 15? why doesnt the german AA gun do more damage? the thing is a 20mm for christ sake. why do the johnson automatic rifles exist in this game? less than 10,000 were built and all they add is ANOTHER M16 FOR THE AMERICANS. the johnson took the BULL**** that americans did with the 1918 and boosted the stats. (where they took a heavy hitting slow firing gun and cranked the fire rate up to 11) why doesnt germany have an automatic rifle? the MG-30 exists. the panzershreck stops being useful after 150M. the bazooka on the other hand has near infinite practical effectivness if you look at their respective charts. why WOULD the bazooka be more effective than a panzershreck? the PZS had a larger round. why do the russians start off with a 70 round smg? WHY DOES GERMANY START OFF WITH A 20 RD SMG? 32 rd mags were made available for the mp34 during ww2, but i guess that kind of upgrade only counts if you are american. the AVS-36 only had 34,500 (MAX) rifles produced, why is it in the game? why does russia need another automatic gun when they have SMGs that hold 70 rds? why does a DP-27 not puncture armor, but when you put it in a T38 light tank it melts through armor like a .50cal? its a .30 cal round and its not EVEN 30-06. why are all of the planes in this game flying tanks? the firepower that most planes in this game are able to take should rip straight through them like a laser through paper mache.AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, CAN WE GET ANTI AIR GUNS THAT COUNTER PLANES?! THAT THING THAT THEY WERE DESIGNED TO DO?!?!all of this doesnt even mention the bugs this game has, like how barbed wire can juggle you so you cant move, how your parachute wont open for no reason, para planes randomly crashing into the ground. the bodies that randomly fall out of the sky. 2 ton cars flipping upside down from going over train tracks slowly. at this point having sunk several hundred hours into this game, i know it as ""the bad game"" and for some reason keep playing only to make more money and buy more stuff. that part is fun, PLAYING for the most part, is NOT and the game will give you more money to ride a bike in a field, than to play because of upkeep. dont buy gold, the devs dont deserve the money until they fix their mess.",0

18289,Dota 2,2016.0," This review may cover both DOTA games, DOTA 1 and DOTA 2.  DOTA 2, in my perspective, is just a rework of its original game, DOTA 1. I have played DOTA 1 for more than 2 years before transferring to DOTA 2. However, I only played this game because I thought it was far better than the previous game.It is, but it's partly not. -Gameplay-The gameplay is just like any most other MOBA games out there that involves communication, skill, and the ability to play the game itself. Personally, I have been a fan of MOBA games back then because MOBA games are quite easy to learn, and its fun.Before moving to DOTA 2, the gameplay on DOTA 1 is easy to understand, because graphics back then were as simple and easy to understand, and I got into it pretty fast. DOTA 2 on the other hand, has better graphics, and the game was far more easier than before. In DOTA 2, the gameplay is shorter, because of how fast-paced the game is, compared to DOTA 1 which requires right timing to actually execute a good play. But they are still the same game that lets you farm creeps, level up your hero, kill the enemy team, and win.Not to mention, DOTA 1 needed a third-party software to play online (at least in other countries) while in DOTA 2, its just download, install, and play.-Controls-DOTA 2 basically has the same controls as DOTA 1, but it has the option to let you customize to your preference. You can now assign different hotkeys for every button that you can use for your hero and the menu. Back in DOTA 1, all hotkeys were quite fixed until you use another third-party software to modify them. -Community-Well, its like in any other MOBA games out there, it's either the community is good, or bad. But honestly, what really makes the DOTA 2 fall currently is the rise of toxicity among players. Since the game is free, more and more players are creating more accounts that lets them play whenever they want if one of their account is banned.-Other Things-Since DOTA 2 is a Valve software, you can actually make money by playing the game. The game has an inventory system that lets you store a certain hero's piece of equipment, or tools that lets you customize those equipment, and even tickets that enables you to watch a certain tournament in DOTA 2 itself. (I still watch on Twitch though.) With these items that you can receive through game drops, you can actually sell it in the community market for Steam Wallet. You can also make more of the items you get by trading with other players.Also, DOTA 2 has its own workshop, which you can visit to check out other gamemodes/maps made by other players in the DOTA 2 community.(Back in DOTA 1, you can only download the maps made by others.) Certain players in the community also create/design new items which can be implemented into the game if the proposed item was approved by players and the developers.-Final notes-Although DOTA 2 is a great game, it has it drawbacks specifically the community, which makes DOTA 2 itself. I mean, how do you play this game without players, right? Even so, its generally fun, especially with your friends. DOTA 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward to those who commit.I recommend this game to people who like multiplayer/MOBA games. I guarantee you, its worth it despite the troubles it might bring.",1

11742,War Thunder,2017.0,"Ah.. War Thunder Review time I guess.Let me go ahead and state, if your a fanboy, I dont care. Your opinion means nothing to me, simply because your opinion is tainted because it could be your ""favorite"" or you really ""enjoy"" this game, therefore keep it too yourself or do a review yourself.This game is not fun in the long run, compared to World of Tanks, the only thing this one has that World of Tanks doesnt, is it isnt a silly tank shooter. I dont care for the planes, simply because, I found it boring to fly around, press M1 over and over or hold it down, until finally your shots actually do something of use other then sparking on the person, or shooting the center gear leg or fuel tanks causing a fuel leak. I had tons of funs in Ground Forces though, Until you start playing every single faction there is, and start to see the reason why you see more of some factions and some of others. This game has no actual form of Balance, and in its attempt to try and keep things balance, and adding realistic stuff too it, they made some things completely unfun to play, while others are so brain dead you can just just toward people, bouncing shells off left and right as people try to pen you.Now, I enjoyed this game. I managed to get a good friend to play, he however left because the game was unfair for him, I ignored it and thought it was just him actting up. I regret not listening too him, after the whole ""cool factor"" of the game wears off, you start to see the problems. Lets start off with Gameplay first.Gameplay: Though it is fun, has a ton of problems, the game doesnt prepare you for anything, because of how the game Progresses, at first you start off as Reserves vs Reserves, which is the starting tanks. This is completely pointless to talk about, because its the most basic of the game, point and shoot, you will most likely kill anything you just shot at, or badly damage them, BUT even at this Tier, yous tart to see the real problems, Because of how the game BR system works, even though you only have 2 tanks, their both 1.0 and require a bit of knowledge to beat higher BR tanks, the game is completely fine with putting you up against these tanks, Often. This is called Uptiered, and its the most annoying thing to happen too you, at any point in the game, because you are fighting against tanks who are actaully better then yours, in any way possible, this of course only if the tank driver can use the tank, but they still get a advantage wtih either, better gun, or better armor, or faster etc etc. Im not even going to talk about Downtiered, because its just basically swinging a club at baby seals at this point. The game shooting Machinics are simple, aim at a spot on a tank, and shoot, if it pens, it hits something, if it doesnt, well it doesnt, too kill a tank in this game, you either kill all their crew, or blow up thier ammo, which requires aimming (For some tanks, ill get too that later), and this is where you start killing the Major problems of this game. Four out of the now Five factions to play Ground Forces, are easy to play. each one giving you HE filler AP rounds, made to pen the tank then blow up and kill damn near anything in the tank, these tanks are what will kill you the most often, because their the easiest to play. Russians have slopped armor with fast moving tanks, allowing even their thin armored tanks to just put themselves into a Angle and bounce shells. Germans have ""Nuke-Rounds"" even at lower tierss, alot of the German tanks, just instantly kill anything you can pentrate, Same with Americans. now Japanese and British is where alot of suffering of the game happens. British tanks Feature fast reloading gun, fast tanks, good moblity (not when backing up) and their guns are extramely good at pentrating, however since British tanks didnt field HE filler rounds in the world, they lack them in the game, actually they dont have anything (expect for the recently added Sherman 2, thats basically M4A1 Sherman put into British line), This makes British one of the most annoying factions to actually kill tanks in, Because Armor Piecing rounds, with no HE fillers is what the British used in real life, in the game.. none of the reason why the British used said rounds, are at all shown, Since you can repair your tank, This also makes it so you have to snipe every single crew or 2 crew in the tank, or try to cause a their ammo to blow up, meanwhile most of the british tanks, cant take a single shot, and will mostly die in a single hit. Japanese have very little armor on their tanks, very small pentration with their guns, and very little HE filler starting out, later on they get up too the same ground as, Americans, Germans, Russians.Now Progression in this game, is low, its a grind while playing matches to unlock a new tank... however once you unlock the tank, you have too use the tank, in order to unlock mods, IE different ammo, REPAIR KIT, or ability to put out fires, all of which shouldnt be a thing, without the repair kit, if your cannon barrel or cannon breach is broke, you cant repair it unless you go too a cap point, Fires will kill you without the ability to put them out, and its a slow and annoying death and will happen alot since you only get 2 charges of it anyway. Luckly the game is nice enough to let you repair your tracks without the repair kit.Im not even going to touch the ""Pay to get"" tanks, because the fact you can buy them and get all the mod for them, already says why their there, its just a massive money grab too get a tank, you cant unlock.All and All, No I wouldnt recommend anyone to get this game, and if you do, too never spent money on it, I have, and I regretted it.",0

19934,Fishing Planet,2015.0,Early Access ReviewI have never fished in real life... I have never been interested in fishing...Then I was introduced to this game.. At first I was like OK this is boring but then after leveling up and catching different types of fishes I got hooked (pun intended).  Really fun game and I've actually learned alot. And I can happily say that this game is so satisfying I never ever have to go fishing IRL.When fishing in the game it actually sounds like I'm at a real river or lake. Sometimes there is annoying little birds or whatever making noise and irritates me. But it sounds very real. The maps are very beautiful.. Lovely little mountains on some... Just trees on others. One map i really like is Florida. Looks amazing.There is a nice variety of fishies and the best one imo is the Walleye.So far a very good game!! Cant wait til they add more maps (EU SOON!!) and more fishies :D,1

Be warned, the hero creation system is nothing like the Hero system used by the PnP game and free players can only create using Archtypes which determine what powers you can select.  You have to be a subscriber, Life Time member, or purchase a free-form character slot.  Also, there hasn't been any real updates to the game in a couple of years since PWE bought out Cryptic and pulled the major devs off for other projects such as Neverwinter.  But all in all, it's still a fun game with a definite comic book feel to the missions and graphics which was intentional.",1
20171,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI really want to like this game but it's hard,there is a problem with the design 75 cards deck (with  4 of-a-kind rule) removes consistency and the mana screw/flood issue also causes significant frustration.(you even have to build your deck with min. 40% of your cards just dealing with mana/sigil problems and even then most of the time you have screw/flood)Losing a game - without even playing is not fun.(it's really frustrating)",0
15860,Magic Duels,2016.0,"As of this writing, I have spent 70 hours playing this game.  Pretty much just been playing Solo Battles once I completed the pretty short Story Quests.The Story Quests were pretty fun and I did really enjoy those.  I wish there were a lot more of those to complete or that they added more on a regular basis.The problems I have with this game:The AI is simply ""amazing"" at it's ability to draw the exact cards it needs, when it needs it.  I guess they program this ability in order to make it a challenge vs a human, but come on, there has to be a better way to make an AI challenging than giving it the ungodly ability to draw any card in it's deck to overcome what is going on at the time.  I mean, just put a few Enchant Aura's on a creature to make it more powerful than what the AI has out?  Well, this AI with no cards in its hand, amazingly enough is able to draw a card that returns your creature to the top of your deck.  That is just one example of the seemingly endless ability of this AI to get the card it needs.The Deck Shuffler is just bad.  You either get a Flood of lands or a Dearth of lands.  Can't tell you how many times I have to restart a duel just to get a decent, initial draw.  And heaven forbid if you get a draw with a few lands, some enchant aura's and no creatures.  All you will draw from that point are more lands and more enchant cards until the AI has its big guns out and you have no way to recover.The way to obtain cards is just annoying.  You either grind coins to purchase boosters or you spend cash to buy coins to purchase boosters.  I have no problem with that with it being a F2P game per se, but I have an issue with just being able to purchase boosters.  I wish you had more purchase options.  The AI seems to have access to all manner of cards and to have to fill your decks out with 6-card boosters is just boring to the extreme.  Getting tired of going up against Planeswalkers with no way to seem to be able to obtain any myself.There seems to be no way to back up a phase ...and the Stop Timer is annoying in that there seems to be some delay when you click it and if you are a tad bit slow, you may end up in the next Phase before you meant to get there.  There also seems to be something off during the Block and Damage dealing phase but that just may be me.Wish there were an easier way to see a stack of lands than currently.  For example, if the AI has tapped several lands and I want to cast something that can target a Land, the only way to ""see"" what is in that stack is to hover my mouse over it and wait for it to pop-up with text.  Cumbersome.I have fun playing it most of the time, but the AI is beyond frustrating!",0

1023,SMITE®,2016.0,"My first experience with a MOBA, and I don't think I'll be switching to LoL or DOTA anytime soon.You know how you get ""that game"" that you end up playing no matter what? This is that game. Fallout 4 is out? This is free, and I need to scratch my itch. Smite is a very well balanced 3rd person take on a MOBA that can attract anyone from a hardcore LoL player to a gamer whose never stepped foot in the genre (aka myself). Besides the current hours I have, another 500 can be added from Xbox playtime. The game is very easy to get into as a casual, but also very fun for people who love to customize builds and find what numbers need to be allocated where to be the most effective (power, attack speed, protections, etc.).Smite is constantly updated, with small patches every few weeks. Also, a new god is added every month or two, allowing the player to always have someone new to try. When you first start out, you are given a few free gods (some are top tier, think of stock guns in TF2) and a few gods are free every week for you to test drive. I would highly recommend the God Pack for anyone who thinks they will sink a decent amount of time into the game. It makes you much more flexible as a player, gives variety to the game, and lets you try what seems to be an endless amount of playstyles that you may have not be able to experience prior. Gems, Smite's premium currency, is given in small doeses every week from logging in, can be bought, and is often given for free from weekend events. Also, skins/voice packs are often on sale. Devs are in constant contact on r/Smite and Twitter, making it extremely easy to contact them for any concerns, and easy for them to see community ideas. They are also some pretty fun guys that are always fun to see on stream or during events.The game's free, give it a try and see how you like it. Make sure to look up builds/guides online to make sure you get the most out of the game. Have fun!",1

Not only is there a terrible exchange rate for pieces you get, the pieces you buy are astronomically expensive with in game currency. The only way to get them is to either grind or pay.

4450,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewCurrently the game has a lot of large glaring issues with it. I am not talking about server stability or queue times as that is the norm for an MMO launch. There are a lot of issues in the game still in the basic areas, like optomization, combat feeling disjointed and overall feeling of clunkiness with the game as a whole. I understand they added the combo combat system to the game to appeal more to the market, but currently it feels very wrong. Action combat was a ""feature"" when advertised to the NA/EU market and currently only one class has the action combat crosshairs in game and admittedly the dev's removed it from all the other classes. I think this game has a lot of potential, and it being an older game with some reworks makes it even more. It seems like they truely wanted to revise and reinvigorate the game. However, currently it just falls flat. I hope the dev's can do something to make this game really shine, but there is a lot of negative information about them circulating around right now so it's a grey area.I cannot reccommend this game simply because promised features that were shown and used previously are completely absent without any notification from the dev team.

Sure, I played D3 through but rather forcing myself than with relish, and I absolutely agree with the opinion that PoE is a way better match for the Diablo franchise than D3 itself. At least, it features the right look & feel, proper dark atmoshere, tons of customizable loot, much more interesting character development, and last but not least - appropriate size and length. And on top of all that it's completely free! ""Free to play"" but not ""pay to win"", so you can enjoy it to the full without spending a single cent.The downsides? Yeah, they exist too, but I'd describe them to be minor and inessential. Permanent connection to the server in a single-player game (but that's commonplace nowadays), somewhat bad placement of waypoints across locations which eventually forces you to replay certain (quite large) locations twice or even more times, rather sophisticated skill tree (not necessarily a bad thing). But the rich core gameplay pays it all off, I must say.In any case, I strongly recommend this brilliant game to all RPG fans and to anyone who loves good games no matter what genre they are.

It's not an exciting game and doesn't have the same level of interaction that many MMO's do, but if you are looking for a casual way to relax and catch some fish than this will probably fit the bill nicely for you.Pros:-No one way to catch a fish-Casual pacing and style-Great graphics-Stable-Simple interface-Great variety of lures so farCons:-Very Grindy-Repetitive-Basically a single player game with chat-Not a lot of reason to chat with other players except to get help on fishing setups-In-game music needs a lot of love.-No true bottom fishing-Not enough GUI flexibility yetI'd consider this game to be in the middle of beta as far as content and bugs. It has a few key features still missing and a lot hammering, but can be enjoyable for those playing now. They have a lot of features still to add that are planned. I do wish that the patch cycle would speed up a bit.",1

856,SMITE®,2018.0,"After playing this game over the course of 3 seasons on the smite launcher and steam version, my feelings for this moba are extremely mixed. Considering at this point I only play once every few weeks, that should indicate my lasting appeal towards Smite. Although the game and its content, such as the gods, game modes and other aspects are great; hi-rez poorly maintains and executes fixes and patches to the game. Hi-rez has trickled down from a respectable corporation to a greedy monopolizing entity, that only focuses on new ways to attract new players; not by improving the servers or balancing, but adding additional cosmetics and other useless cash grab elements. They claim as if they actually care about catering to the communities needs in terms of balancing items and gods, fixing bugs and reducing crashes; but the only results we are given involve a more unstable foundation and SKINS. Hell, at least give skins to different gods besides the same pool of gods they seem to fancy most. For instance, it took years for Ravana to receive a new skin, which was later removed due to copyright. After a few months, they decide to literally recycle the skin and just change the color scheme/effects and vp to avoid more copyright issues. I'm completely aware that some people are fine with the current changes, and that's fine. All I'm saying is, hi-rez needs to step their game up and stop trying to divide their company on so many different projects. Which is probably one of the main issues. They aren't giving Smite enough light of day and attention, and only make light hearted pledges to redditors just to keep them calm and reduce the pressure on themselves. Overall, I'd give this moba a 5/10 in its current conditions. If hi-rez actually starts to fix year old bugs and balance items/gods more fairly and effectively, it could potentially reach an 8/10 or better.",0

2073,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFirstly, there are >200 hours of non-Steam play time.Alright, Robocraft was a great game back in 2014. Your goal was extremely simple - build anything you want, arm it with some (or many) lasers and fight! The battles were extremely dynamic though being simple - drive to the map center and fight to death! Despite there were 3 times less modules the customization was much bigger. Why? There were no ultimate machines - even a car with four wheels and a pair of guns could pwn.Also, there were only light, heavy, glass chassis blocks and 5 armor levels, nowadays there are no armor cubes (Robocraft degrades too, lol).When did it all started? When the plasma was added. It was the first op-thing to be implemented. Bombers ruled the battles, people who could build a spin-bomber (plasma could only be placed on the top of the block at this time) were the Robocraft kings. But that didn't stopped me. I've continued building my gunbeds (Phoenix, Titan and Lapis tanks, eh, old times).After some time the railguns were added and laser fire range was fixed - it came to be infinite. It was the peak of Robocraft. The best times.Then.. it started to degrade.More modules led to the overpowered bombers and drones. Anything land-based could be destroyed in a single plasma strike. But to make things worse, FreeJams have added the repair cost. And that was the worst time in Robocraft.You just simply couldn't use anything above Tier 6 (yeah, there were Tiers and Robo Ranking) without premium, so Robocraft was claimed pay-to-win for that. One unlucky battle could erase your money from the past 5 lucky battles.I've nearly not played Robocraft at this time - it wasn't attractive for me.Repair costs were deleted, later.And then Robocraft started to degrade at full force.Megabots weren't so cool as we thought.New weapons were too useless or too overpowered. Overpowered guns have been later fixed and now they are useless too.The game has been too simplified. No Tech Points anymore, for example.Community Robot Factory was the second biggest mistake.. no, it's the first biggest (repair costs are the second) mistake FJs have ever done. The coolest aspect of Robocraft, building, was zeroed.And what do we see now? No money anymore. CRF overpowered bots everywhere. Anything hand-made is unplayable.Weapon switch. Energy. 10 sec regeneration. Auto-aim guns. 10 hours to make a single gun.Finally, CASES? Is it just me who thinks that sandbox game shouldn't use the randomness?So-o, that's Robocraft, degraded and simplified. It could be a great game, with its great potential.. but Freejams have chosen a wrong way. If you still want to play it - try, but it doesn't worth my time anymore.TheSol out.",0
12675,Black Squad,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewBlack Squad plays out like CSGO, except faster, with more weapons, attachments, and the ability to aim down sight. Basic mechanics like movement/quickswitching/inventory system, etc are almost identitcal to CSGO's. You run faster with your knife out and there is even a keybind for inspecting your weapon.Pros:+Shooting feels good. Kills feel satisfying and meaty. Aim and reaction time are rewarded.+Extremely sniper-friendly. Sniper rifles are significantly more powerful than the AWP is in CSGO. +Extremely well-optimized. 144hz supported. +Very good graphics for a F2P game. Animations/textures/viewmodels are superb.+Very player-friendly F2P model. Vast majority of ingame weapons are easily obtainable with normal currency.+Decent maps. People complaining about the small maps are talking about the deathmatch maps.+Wide set of options; decent built-in crosshair optimization.+Multiple interesting and unique gamemodes. Defuse, VIP assassination, etc.+Battleye anticheat is more robust than VAC.+Pretty good netcode. Hit registration seems very solid.Cons:-Not enough weapons; they will surely keep adding weapons.-Deathmatch maps are too small.-Grenade physics/rental system are worse than CSGO's.-No ranked competitive system; this may come in the future.Play this game. It could easily be 15 dollars, but it's free.",1
19040,SMITE®,2018.0,"SMITE is your counterpart to LOL - A Moba, behaves very similarly, has casual and competitive gamemodes, and your only difference is third-person perspective versus an angle-locked overhead scroller. Either of these games are easy to pick up from a fresh start, but when trying to play one after getting comfy with the other, it's only gonna feel horrible. I managed to step into SMITE a bit before League, and I took this game over the other as a comfort pick. Since this game is alike League, expect it to have a lot of the same elements as LOL - A high mechanical and game-knowledge learning curve, skill ceilings and required knowledge of all characters (considering Smite double+ of League's), item understanding and grasp of the changing meta, the list goes on. I would say from my perspective, Smite came off as a lot less intimidating witht the amount of knowledge required over League, but I'm sure that can be argued either way,SMITE's a good game, and it can be good fun. Always the kind of game to be more fun with friends, and third person makes things a lot more demanding for mechanical control, rather than ""where can you click a million times with your mouse and hope the game/client responds in time and accurately."" It has a strong casual scene, and a competitive scene, with some very likeable figures to represent the game (no, I'm not talking about DMBrandon).However, I have more than a few complaints, after nearly 2k hours on PC and around 700 on console:- Just because it's a smaller community, doesn't mean that toxic people don't necessarily exist. They do, in less quantity, but man, Smite players can be ridiculous. It only gets worse the higher up on the Ranked ladder you climb.- The tutorial for SMITE does a poor job at teaching you practical knowledge and buying. Yes, it's trying to cram a lot in within about five tutorial games, but it does a very ineffective job at that. You're taught to strictly focus towers or dive head-on into fights, buy Meditation (as one of the worst actives available), and the tutorial only initiates other horrible habits for new players. Be open to learn from YouTubers and other players as you explore.- The game is typically broken in some way, all the time. For an example, to compliment Ullr's highly anticipated and very rare Tier 5 skin, they buffed him ""subtly"" into an absolute assinine state, where he received a 100% ban rate at Worlds. Relics are typically either functional, or bugged to where they often won't go off in time. Relics not working is more of a niche complaint being that I play competitively, but having a game that is very often imbalanced, alike League, can be stressful.- Ranked matchmaking is misery. I don't know much for League's ranking system, but I do know that the way Smite's ranked matchmaking operates is punishing. It is intended to be a logical system, to where if you are performing very well in lower MM, it will raise your matchmaking Rank/ELO to try and pair you with more skillful players. It's a good system, in a sense, but retrospectively is brutal if it isn't accurate. For me to have the capability to place in Platinum in a past split is nice, and even then I was being restrained by solo-queuing. A brand new season started recently, and I ran my placement games. To be consistently matched WITH Bronze V players, or players who were new to ranked, yet be matched against Platinum and Diamond players (like I should be), is ridiculous. To have a placement in the middle of Silver, yet I can go and compete at a Diamond level, beating people who have previously placed Masters in a great game, is VERY ridiculous. Ranked is an optional experience for competitive players, and if you do decide to take this opportunity on, do not expect it to be forgiving to you in the slightest. Most of the complaints are ones that League players can say the same for, as expected. But, if you can look over said issues, and grab a few friends, SMITE as a casual game is expansive and enjoyable.",1

Furthermore they've changed their payment model, but if you purchased items with real money that are now available with in game currency, you where never refunded for them, wow!  Crate rewards are far too low and we need to be rewarded more, especially in deathmatch, and the losing team is always screwed over with a crap crate even if they individually performed very well.Freejam seems to believe that it should take hundreds of hours to get to any sort of endgame, so if you're fairly casual, this game simply isn't for you.",0

2571,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Product received for freeTree of Savior offers a lot of the things that got me into MMOs years ago. Highly customizable characters, a huge explorable world, dozens of enemy types that are not just blank models in different colors that throw attacks at you in set intervals. It invokes a certain nostalgia with it's 2D grindiness and surely shares a strong similarity in terms of art design with the game Ragnarok online, but it is more than that - it has a very unique and interesting class system that allows you to create characters to fit your playstyle and needs, the battle is incredibly interactive and fun and for those who like them - there are whole areas dedicated to puzzle like events.Character movement can be clunky sometimes and there are some weird issues with some of the control options, the game surely has performance issues it shouldn't have and the streets are full of gold spammers. Weirdly enough this is a free to play game that makes it incredibly hard for you to spend money, which is good 'cause the pay-2-win argument is something you can still bring up, but it surely isn't as relevant as in a lot of other free MMO games.Despite it's flaws this game is incredible and unique, it's probably not for everyone, but you should check whether it is for you.",1

9426,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"Edit: wil update this review soon when I feel like spending some time on it since I've gotten back into the game recently and some stuff has changed.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: I have also played on browser version, so my total playing time is ways more than just my steam hours.I started playing after the timoshenko update hit and I absolutely loved it. Great gameplay, lots of laughs, premium players have no advantages (except leveling/money bonusses and weapon skins) and the way it worked was good. Reto did a lot to improve the game, they added new guns, nerfed and buffed stuff to make it more fair. The thing i loved about this game was the different weapons for each faction, all with their own characteristics. The grinding part of the game is kinda bad, but when you have grinded long enough you can upgrade your gun. That is also something i loved about this game, since you can mod your guns the way you like them. A big disadvantage about the grinding and modding thing is that people you'll fight against as a beginning player will have better guns, but that is not that bad since its lots of fun to play. It was huge fun to participate in a battle with tanks, planes, and lots of lil' infantry jimmy's. There was still a lot of work to do, since hits werent always counted and character movement was quite poor. Reto improved that and added lots of stuff to the game in the updates. A little bit to much probably. We have loads of camo to choose from now but we only have a few maps to fight in. They keep adding camo and and unnecessary stuff (like the third german pistol), but it seems like they dont care about adding new maps. In one of the last updates they added more vegetation, but all they did was copy paste the same bush all over the place. After 5 years of early access developing, the graphical part of the game is still very bad.Something else i dont like about the game is the toxic community who wants reto to nerf everything they get killed with. Thats also because of the different types of players (e.g. tankers want to nerf anti tank stuff, infantry wants to nerf tanks). I used to play all classes and i think it is pretty balanced. Reto did a good job on balancing, allthough the russians are a little bit underpowered and germans a bit overpowered (e.g. MG42(1200 max rpm) and the heavily armored tanks).Till this ""Devyatayev"" squad update hit i absolutely loved it. Sometimes the battles where a little unbalanced, e.g. when the enemys had lots of tanks and your team had none, but if u had a tanker u could easily switch and kick some♥♥♥♥♥ This is diffirent right now. You have to grind your squad ribbon to be able to switch to diffirent classes. I have quit a lot of characters, I need to grind em all up to be able to play normally again. Another thing about this squad system is that you can never play alone, you will always be in a squad with some random guys who are f*cking around.They have done such a thing with the ribbon system in an earlier update, when they went through the ribbon system, but it wasnt that bad, since u could still use all of your characters. At that time, there were not that much experienced players with lots of characters, so it didnt matter that much. Right now, there are lots of player who have grinded their way up and have lots of characters. They will all have to grind that ribbon on their characters to be able to play normally again. With this being said, i dont recommend this game to new players, since it is still in early acces and things like this will probably happen some more in the future. It will also take a long time before it can be released, because there is still a lot of work to do, especially the amount of maps(maps are all same scenery) and graphical part of the game is very poor. For someone who just starts, this new squad (ribbon) system wont be the problem, you'll just level ur squad ribbon up through playing while ur grinding for better equipment. But still, something like this might happen again in the future, so you'll be just as mad on reto as a big part of the community right now.If Reto dont chance this squad system and refuse to add new maps and if they dont improve the graphical part of the game im gonna leave and play some battalion 1944 or Red orchestra, or even WW1 (Verdun, Battlefield 1) instead. I always liked Heroes and generals more than other ww2 games like battalion and red orchestra just because of the tank, plane and infantry gameplay all together and of course because of the generals part of the game. If not this is after Warthunder the second Free2play WW2 game im gonna quit because the developers are f*cking it up.",0

What there support said is that there was no way for them to see if the attack was from me or another IP so they would not do the rollback. I had high hopes for the game the idea is neat but if you are just going to be one of the many hacked accounts where no rollbacks are given what is the point in playing the game.

15214,War Thunder,2015.0,"REVIEW FULLY REWRITTEN - JULY 14 2017(Speaking for ground forces only, I have limited experience with planes)There is no balance in this game.-PvP is painful because of the battlerating spread, your first game in a newly unlocked tank with no researched equipement will put you against people with fully upgraded tanks of a whole BR higher.-Shell types are broken, HEAT-FS ruins the role of armor, like ATGMs-Planes have nothing to do in tank battles. I know it's what WT wanted from the beggining, but dying because a rocket fell out of nowhere is the most infuriating thing in this game. We need a ""tank-only"" option. Since there is no player-driven tanks in plane gamemodes, I don't see why there should be player-driven planes in tank gamemodes.-Playing tank-only without premium tanks and premium account is near impossible, grinds are too long, and money income is ridiculous.-PvE is probably the best thing they ever added in this game. Tank PvE is really rewarding, but so freaking hard. Russians and germans are near impossible with most teammates, and the game is allowing tanks of low tiers (BR 3.7) to fight in games where people have like BR 6.0 tanks. These players are a burden to their team, they do nothing, they bother everyone. This gamemode needs a minimum-requirement limitation, with smoke screens being forbidden and minimum BR being 5.0. If it wasnt for that, I'd play nothing but this gamemode. But spending 20mins carrying only to lose because an idiot did nothingthe whole game... Also I don't get how xp is calculated, sometimes a player who did half as much as you (1 plane kills, 15 kills, 7 assists vs 5 plane kills, 15 assists and 35 kills) will be better ranked than you.This gamemode is really promising. Now gaijin needs to fix all of these problems.I still play it a lot in hope that things get better. The gameplay is really enjoyable, and realism is here. However all of these negative things ruin the experience enough to make you ragequit rather often: why bother staying in a 15-20min game where you already know you've lost or won't do anything just by looking at the team(s).",0

2081,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2015.0,"Though it's old this is a very beautiful game. And it is very true to Tolkien's world of middle earth. So as a Tolkien fan I would recommend this game just for the world alone. I will never forget the first time I saw Weathertop or entered the mines of Moria.The quests have a feel of old MMOs. They can be rather grindy at times. But the main (epic) quest line is very well written and pulls you into the game. Makes the lesser and more grindy quests bearable. I would highly recommend reading the quest text of the main quest line as it really makes the game so much better and creates a lot of immersion. The community in the game is very nice and helpful. I don't know if it's because I play on a RP server, but I have never been trolled or anything for asking a question on world chat. People just seem very friendly and helpful. The auction house is pretty empty and often also overpriced. But asking in chat you never have to wait long to find someone willing to sell what you're looking for. ",1

Either the game won't exist anymore or they will have fixed everything and the game will be alive.",0
14476,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has a lot of potential, but it hamstrings itself with a series of deck-building rules that I struggle to see as anything other than a cash-grab.  I'll lay it out short and sweet: You get cards by playing the two Draft modes, either against AI for 2500 gold or against players for 5000 gold.  In order to get gold to play draft modes, you either play ranked matches (slow) or play against AI (fast if you win reliably).  The AI only pays off if you can reliably win 7 games.Now here's the problem: your deck is unplayable unless it consists of 33% mana and a minimum of 75 cards, or 50 cards and 25 mana.  That's a large enough percentage that you /will/ run in to situations where you get mana starved or mana flooded - either you have a hand with 3 mana and all your cards cost 4+ to cast or you have a fistful of mana and nothing else.  Now, will this happen every game?  Of course not!  A well-balanced deck with a good mix of cards will only be left helpless at the mercy of RNG occasionally.  However, anecdotally, it feels like it happens at least once every 7 games, and there's no option to design your deck in such a way that you can eliminate this problem and get more reliable results.  Sometimes you just draw 6 mana sources from turns 15 through 21 and watch yourself lose the game despite playing to the best of your ability, and the frustration when that happens on game 7 of a Gauntlet run spoils the rest of the gameplay.  This enforced lack of reliability in a mode that dangles rewards over your head for winning consistently is a bad gameplay experience.  It feels designed to tease people with the possibility of getting better cards without actually offering a realistic chance of doing so.  This is the hook in Eternal's ""free to play"" model - sure, you can play the game for free, if you're the sort of fortunate soul who can make a profit by buying boxes of magic cards and selling the foils for more than the cost of the box.",0
8858,Digimon Masters Online,2017.0,"8/10 Stars for one of the only Digimon Games online. If you have nostalgia for Digimon, then this is the game for you. It's a quick game where you can get high level digimon and get Mega status... but please learn the mechanics first so that you don't get sucked into spending too much money in the game.It's like the usual korean MMO but it's straight to the point with hack & slash and questing.The dev team & gm team do their best to keep this game fresh and they're doing a better job as time goes on.Recently asked a GM on the official discord to help with my request for improvements to the game and they listened.I recommend it to anyone who loves Digimon but for the usual person looking for a good MMO they might find another game worth spending their time in.",1
2480,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI've played this game for over a year and about 600 hours (the standalone launcher isn't tracked by Steam) and spent probably $50 altogether on premium time and cosmetic items.Robocraft used to be good, but then the lead devs started coming to work with their pants on their heads. The Epic Loot update made it virtually impossible to get the robot parts you need to finish your robot, as everything is based on random drops. The game is still plagued by game-breaking bugs (like half the players on a team never connecting) that have been around for over a year.The devs are pretending that nothing's wrong, even though they are hemorrhaging players on a daily basis.Don't waste your time here. It's another grindy, pay-to-win cashgrab disguised as a freemium game.",0

Robocraft has been such a great game I really loved playing.I don't exactly know why the developers decided to change up the whole game principle with Tiers (1, 2 and so on).In my last days back then the ""boss battle"" (I guess) was introduced and I enjoyed playing it as well.And then... the developers crashed the game with introducing Levels (?) instead of Tiers and changing the game mode from just stacking the whole team onto the other side and capturing the enemy's base to this weird thing with these ""Protonium Reactor"" (from Wikipedia lol).When I started the game today after a long time, I was greeted with my old account and 25 cases I had to open (~5mins uff).The game went a long way from Free2Play to Pay4Win with cases and add-ons for 108.96€.I searched for a match and had to wait for about a minute because I left the last match (a year or two ago?).[h2] Yeah, so what am I supposed to say in conclusion?

2208,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"I don't write reviews often, this probably my second one but I have to, considering how much I enjoy this and plan to throw money at it every so often. I am guessing I am the only person who regrets not getting a better founder's pack?If you're the type of person who simply likes exploring and collecting achievements, this is something I would highly recommend.Pros:-Beatiful Art-Nostelga Factor-Easter eggs hidden through the game-Great Music-Quests dish out appropriate rewards-The Grind is incredibly minor compared to other Korean MMOs (More about this below)Cons:-Lack of Trading-Auction HouseSo aside from the common complaints: bugs, lag, disconnects, gold bots etc, I've rarely ever seen a newly opened MMO not falling victim to these kind of things (there's not a single game I can think of that did have this happen to them at some point). Every single one of them I played had these issues ironed out to an acceptable level. I am looking forward to conditions improving in the future but I bracing myself when the game is open access :P.I am not sure what IMC games is planning but if they're sticking to their initial claim, they're probably using this founder's pack as a way to gauge and optimize the game for those who are willing to support the game financially. As money oriented as that is, don't forget there's no free lunch, someone has to pay for the maintence and development costs. I'd hate to see this game go under like Ragnarok did: http://adultimum.net/rw/extras.php?section=soappservWhile I don't agree with some of IMC's business decisions, they'll likely change aspects of the game overtime. Honestly their response is pretty much expected; can't really expect a new MMO to over compensate the amount of resources required when their player base is unknown.I favor grindy games so I am a bit bias but this is nothing compared to old Ragnarok. I got a character to level 70 in about a week or less and at least 20% of my play time is me falling asleep or watching videos on the side while leaving the game on. The grind can be almost circumvented if you actually take the time to explore the maps and pick-up the hidden quests. Exploring maps and completing quests rewards you with EXP cards which you can beneficial if you plan properly. Anyone complaining about the grind in this game is either:+rediculously high leveled (which is expected anyways, so what the heck?)+tried to get to hit high levels quickly by ""grinding"" and burned out+simply ignored what the game had to offer",1
6394,EverQuest II,2014.0,A great old-school MMORPG. It still has high system requirements but most shouldn't have a problem with it. It is a gorgeous game with very in-depth lore. You can't get any better than that for old school either.,1
996,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"Fallout Shelter is a F2P game that originally surfaced on mobile devices a few years ago shortly before the release of Fallout 4. I remember completely failing at the task at hand and had my Vault and its Dwellers silenced forever due to a series of unfortunate events. I can only remember Deathclaws and my poorly equipped bunch valiantly defending their incompetent Overseer.  Recently the game was released on Steam and I thought it best to try and redeem this Overseer's tarnished record. The good news is that Vault 757 is flourishing nicely and has a lovely bunch of Dwellers who either wander around taskless or work 24/7 365 days of the year doing what they know best... constantly turning a valve.  I have to say that having had a fresh approach to the game, it is really accessible and it  is refreshing  not to have microfractions constantly pinging up asking you to spend more and more until your savings are  non-existent.  You can have it running in the background while you do some work or browse the latest news. Yes, tasks can be repetitive and you do have to wait to reach quests(Which is the interesting part). However I'm sure you have more important things to do rather than mindlessly click on tabs... If you get tired, you can buy a few  Mr Handys to automatically collect resources. Just be careful not to have them engage with raids or infestations as these lovely machines cost 2000 caps each to repair. It's a neat little management game and I would recommend you give it a go. Just remember to keep those Stimpaks and RadAways stocked and you'll do just fine!  ",1
2487,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThs game is a lot of fun and the combats are usually pretty competitive.All was fine until the epic loot update and they removed the RB rewards for matches (used to buy whatever parts you want) and replaced by a random drop system.The random drop system is not fun at all since you can play for a good while without ever getting parts you will actually use and instead getting a ton of useless parts.  You then recycle them at 1/10th of the part value and end up getting maybe 1 usefull part per 10 to 20 matches.I totally recommend this game as it is fun, but be prepared to be ""incentivize"" more than ever to buy premium status.  And even with premium you still get that sad random drop system.Because that is such a turn off for me, I have to give a thumb down to the game at this point.I really, REALLY hope they will bring back the RP system, and if they ever do, I will be extremely happy to review this review :)",0

1739,War Thunder,2018.0,"In its current state, I cannot recommend it, mostly due to the sheer levels of BS levels of grinding. Not to mention the way they treat the community, they literally insulted the community by comparing the M1 Abrams, (a top tier tank) with Parts and FPE, which are essential to maintaining a combat functional tank, with one of their counter-arguments is that it was always there, as if that makes it okay. These people are hopeless.Grinding for Parts and FPE has been made SLITGHYL easier, by removing the need to research two modifications to get to rank two, which has FPE, it will also automatically research Tracks (or tires) which is one of the most idiotic things I have had the displeasure of experiencing. We have been waiting Italian tanks for a while now, yet we still only have two premiums. And helicopters can spawn camp from miles away. Not to mention how frustrating some of the tiering is, The KV-1B (And KV-1E but the KV-1B is the bigger problem) is just an up-armored KV-2 L-11 with a F-34 gun, yet it's a lower tier? and the Jumbo has no right to be able to get down tierd into 3.7. Recently they've also started making more and more Premium top tier vehicles, this gives any idiot with a credit card a ticket straight to top tier, for a while top-tier American teams were getting they crap pushed in due to  noobs buying the XM-1, filling a match that should be filled with people who know their stuff, with a bunch of noobs, making matches extremely unbalanced.I'm not gonna be surprised if Gaijin ends up censoring this review, but I'll keep playing it.

10215,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewOkay SO. I have been heavily enjoying this game and I've been doing well if I do say so myself. The game I feel has a lot of potential and I hope that more people do decide to pick up the game and start playing it more than the other standard BR games right now. There are a lot of pros and cons that I can think of for this game but, for the sack of time I am just going to list a few.PROS:1. Class Selection - I think that this is one of my favorite options in the game. Being given the ability to pick between a Paraglider, Mountain Climbing Kit, and a Snowboard along with a free minor weapon setup to start the game up is just wonderful and I think allows everyone to have an equal fighting chance in the beginning of the match.2. Weapon play - Now I won't say that it is as good as PUBG's Weapon Play but, I will say that it is damn good for what it is, and I hope that a lot more people realize this as well. I do think that it needs some adjusting cause I do think that there is some latency between bullets when fighting or just bad hitbox registration because there have been a few not many but, a few times where I have dead centered a sight down on someone not moving and it just miss for no reason at all.3. Lastly, For the Pros Map Size - I feel like this is a very comfortable map size for what has been given to us. Especially with all the class selection options we get that allows us to traverse the map even quicker. CONS:1.  Sound Clarification - I have a really hard time distinguishing where I am being shot from. There were a few instances where I just simple could not figure out where the player was shooting from because I just couldn’t pinpoint the area of which the sound was resonating. There was one major instance where I was being shot from a house a block down but, it sounded like the player was damn near next to me.2. Minor Glitching - I don't know if these are just glitches within the game or just game smoothing issues but, I’ve had several matches where I died because when I swapped back to a different weapon it showed I was on that weapon selected but, in all reality was a completely different weapon. The last game that I just played I used a Grenade swapped to a shotgun and it showed that my shotgun was selected but, in fact it was still my grenade and I feel like this is something that really needs to be fixed.3. Hitboxes - I feel like the player hitboxes could be worked on just a tiny bit more in my honest opinion, for most I feel like it’s comfortable but, as the game moves forward I would like the hitboxes to become a lot better and the hit registration to become a lot more accurate.That about wraps it up for my review I don't do these very often but, this is a great game and I really believes that it deserves more publicity. I feel like with some content updates and patching that this game could become a gem and become just a popular as Fortnite and PUBG but, that’s a long stretch and really depends on how hard you all want to work on the game.

I am an old skool gamer, so the pixelated style is right up my alley. The gameplay is also pretty good, with different characters and stats to level up by killing all sorts of beasts, gods, and conquering dungeons--including the one belonging to the Mad God Oryx himself.There is lots of stuff to do, lots of people to play with and to help defeat your foes. Pets, rare items, dungeon crawling, beastie bashing... did I mention it is really addictive if you are into this sort of thing?The big downside is the gold can only be purchased with real money, and the dollar to gold exchange rate really sucks (though I shouldn't expect complete fairness in a fantasy world, but still, $5 for 500 or 5,000 gold seems fair to me). There are some people who pay TONS to get the best gear, create the ultimate pet, and basically make themselves a pixelized Master of The Universe (He-Man not included). With the constant, looming threat of permanent death (when you die, bye bye goes ALL your stuff... EVERYTHING), any money spent on your character will be tossed out the window the minute you fall in battle.Overall, fun game, but the Pay-To-Win part is kinda lame. Gold exchange rate needs to be a bit fairer, but I doubt that will happen in all honesty.Update:Sadly, it seems that this game's popularity has dropped off the face of the earth.

Following the trend of MMORPGs, the game allows to create a character from a set of available classes for both genders. These classes include Warrior, Rogue, Wizard... The game has a really slow pace and beating up enemies + collecting loot from their corpses don't meet the expectations of the modern MMORPG gamer.In short, it's just a game to try for a day or two... just to know that it exists & you've played it. Also, this is kinda just the beta release; so the review too, is based on that as well... (DATED 18th DEC 2016)",0

125,Fishing Planet,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewOk, so I haven't had this game that long but I have played it enough to give a good review. Now lets start off like this:This game is a really good representation of really fishing. you don't catch fish every cast and when you do catch fish, it isn't a giant (1-2 pounder bass wise). The mechanics are really good and i mean this game runs smooth on a laptop not designed for gaming so thats a big pro. Ok now... the cons (subjective maybe) Ok so the way you have get snagged. its annoying but it isnt killing the game. I love fishing lillie pads but almost everytime I get snagged. again maybe subjective. another con has to be where you can fish on a lake. I feel that it is just way to limited. I know you can cast to places you can't wallk but what if you want to cast that way but at a different angle? I feel that instead of putting markers down there should be one at the louge or whatever and then you can walk whereever you please around the pond/lake (river is different maybe section the it off would be good.  I think it just gets to crowded sometimes. remember you got this game realistic   how about add to that by adding this to it.     ummm other than that I think this game is really good. great job devs! now.. do I recommend this game. yes absolutly but ONLY if you don't care for long waits before you get a fish or the fish you want.",1
20303,H1Z1,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewOne of the best worst games I've ever played.

19133,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,The best card game.Probably the only card game with real random RNG and not bs/fake/rigged draws.

20117,World of Warships,2017.0,"Just love the game. Have paid a fortune for games I've got bored off within the hour but this game just keeps me interested. I'm sure it will get to the point were it is just a grind, but who cares. Most of the bad reviews seem to be from people with 100s hrs played. I see any game that keeps me entertained for £0.5 - 1 per hour as a good game. So far I should have paid £20 for this game. For a free game its really worth trying. Not only that my 7yr old son loves it on co-op. With no help from me he got 2 kills and came top of the leader board in one game. ---You will end up spending some cash as there are some things that you sort off need (docks for extra ships).

Their choice to include what is practically malware in their ""Gaijin.net Agent"" client that cannot be easily uninstalled, forces its way onto your taskbar and automatically starts up with windows without any prompting is disgraceful. Everything that this ""agent"" is supposed to do is also handled by the game's native launcher window - this begs the question as to the purpose of this new client which is not clearly defined by Gaijin or anyone esle.I thought that it was bad enough when I discovered that Gaijin's native launcher constantly seeds updates to other players by default and without warning...this is on a whole new level.

2356,PlanetSide 2,2018.0,"This game is one that actually stands out. This is not a game you can jump in and instantly domminate everyone. It takes time to unlock upgrades and learn how to play. I've played this game since the first year of it being out with SOE and then to Daybreak games. I've seen it have days of glory and have days of sorrow. It's a massive game that takes a player into 1 of 5 landscapes and thows them in a world of Air, Tank, and infantry play. It's a battlefield on a grand scale. Hundreds of players all at once. Each doing what they want and what they can to help their faction. Outfits are a bunches of players that can act as one or just goof around. Squads to join to play with friends or to work on team work. A fast scale of customization all for free. A fast spectrum of players that range from hard veteran players to just brand new players that are just trying to find a new game that they like. A lot of people complain about certain aspects of the game but they forget that they get everything for free. They can spend money to unlock different weapons and armor but they don't have to. It's a game, that as I said before, takes time. You cannot go in and play for only an hour and get the full experence of the game. It's a great game that has survived for over 5 years and I still love it and can't wait to see what daybreak does for it.",1

If you aren't completely sadistic and have some self respect you just keep your ♥♥♥♥ing fingers away from this terrible game. You're gonna start at the bottom of the rank lists playing against people with over 40'000 hours who literally just bought a new account to ♥♥♥♥ you up and tell you how homophobical they are, or how they banged your mum and dad and sister and brother last night. Ideally, you're gonna become better, actually you won't, but you will be sometimes carried so hard through your games that you'll manage to get to some decent ranks, where you'll get stomped because you play against people who sacrificed their girlfriends for pure reaction time and insanely inhuman skills. Talking and having fun at this stage is basically impossible, since you will have to drop down everything that might even slightly decrease your attention, e.g: Your baby, your girlfriend, the phone, the doorbell, everything. After 500 hours you'll get to the elo hell, Legendary Eagle Master, where you are gonna face off exact copies of KennyS, ApeX, olofmeister and more.

12849,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"Good card game. Many playstyles, no HS-like value decks disguised as different classes. Dev team gives you ample gifts. In fact, they give away so many things its appropriate to say that again; Cygames is very generous and will constantly give away goodies like free packs and custom emblems. You will have plenty of cards and money and will have no problem building at least 1 or 2 competitive decks. Take Two is also very fun and has its own meta.

Duel Links,2017.0,"I have spend months playing the mobile version and I will spend a lot more time, but that's because I am stupid like that.The Speed Duel format can be interesting and there is some nice variety of decks to be played with and against. But this is a port of a mobile game and it is suffering from the fact that you won't have the top meta decks without paying real money (a lot of them). Even if you farm the NPCs 3 times a day and do your 100 ranked wins every month it will be hard/impossible to keep up just with the newly released boxes with cards. The later you start the game the more you are screwed when it comes to old boxes that have several good/meta cards.You can have somewhat of a fun by keeping yourself on low rank (by surrendering when you are about to rank up) and playing pet decks like Dino or whatever, but even then you will get bored from the endless farming.Cyber Angels are the cancer to fear.",0

I really like all things related world war 2, vietnam, and present day. I really am facinated in tanks, aircraft,and ships. Now I own KSP and like making passanger planes, but sometimes its fun flying a jet with real phisics. But I wish I didnt have to spend FREAKING $70 SO I CAN FLY A PLANE OVER A BEACH. now I know you have to make funds some how to keep the game going, I get it. My favorite military jet is probably the A-10. people say its ugly with its stubby nose and is weird jets blah blah blah. Well I think its a magnificent sight.

Do I want to playout normandy, YES. But I cant. Do I want to fly a A-10, YES. But I cant. Im 13 living in a small town, so there is almost no way for me to do somthing like mowing lawns becuase some ones already doing that type of thing. I cant get a job, and I like to save my money, instead of use it for a plane on a game. I think the game is great, but Eagle and  fighter really got to get there DLC'S strait. Because if the rediculous pricing, I can't buy any thing making the game real boaring real quick, making me think of the game as just, good, instead of fantastic. I know they need money but 70-80 $$$ for a beach and some planes and tanks is just stupid. I dont mean to be rude, but I could buy something that could last a life time, were this could be wiped by somthing wrong with the game, computer, ETC.

The questing system is essentially 300 variations of ""kill 8 orcs(or goblins, or collect 8 things from dead orcs)"" mixed with other useless sidequests that add no value to the story. Whoever did the quests in this game was tragically lazy. None of the quests are bundled, you can do several quests in an area, turn them all in, and the quest giver or the next quest giver will just give you quests in the same area that you could have gotten while you were in the area the first time.

11909,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"The game is the best in its genre. People need to understand the mentality of its gameplay, you are not suppose to open and play it for hours.

Its gonna be slow, its gonna take time but it is worth it, because this is YOUR Vault with YOUR people.Some notes for new players. -The game is free but extremely fair. You can cheat some premium items without any repercussions. I would personally recommend it.-This is a casual game as you don't need to worry too much if you make some mistakes. But it has great depth and interesting mechanics to research and improve your vault and make better decisions.With that being said it not without its flaws. The managing of your dwellers can become  a huge chore later on. The UI doesn't help since it's build for mobiles. But that is my single complain. I wish they make some improvements there but I don't see that happens especially since its exactly the same game everywhere, iOS, Android, Bathesda PC client, Windows 10 and steam versions.Unfortunately for those wondering, you can't auto sync your game with the mobile version, even though all the platforms share the same kind of save file.

19484,DCS World Steam Edition,2018.0,"Excellent flight simulator. I have hundreds of hours on this game total, however switched from Steam to the official launcher instead for better beta access and access to many more purchasble aircraft.Some things to note about this simulator are:1) This is a flight simulator, not an arcadey flying game. There are options to make the game easier, but I have not used them so I cannot speak on how it plays with those settings enabled.2) As a flight simulator the learning curve is pretty immense. It takes many many hours to get comfortable flying a specific aircraft and learning each specific thing it has to offer. This isn't even counting the time it takes to get used to the combat aspects.3) The level of detail in the clickable cockpits is quite simply, amazing. Having nearly every switch and system functional is something no other game offers to the extent DCS does.I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging, yet rewarding flight simulator. Would not recommend to anyone looking for games like Ace Combat (Nothing wrong with those games, but it's not a simulator). I would also recommend anyone seriously consider buying this game to invest in a decent flight stick, as you pretty much need it.",1

749,DCS World Steam Edition,2015.0,"Hello,this game is a piece of art. Some say it is the best mil avio sim there is out there. Even with its free module you will find yourself capapble of doing many tasks and missions (using the wide weaponary). But don't think you will be able to hop in the game and start doing all the ace manuevers and tactics. You will have to put your mind to it and approach it with the atitude of learning new stuff. Game is in no mean necessary to be played as if you are a real pilot. You can take it casualy, but you will still need to take notes and be patient. The feeling of reward after succeding is huge. After you master the Frog, you can try out some of the other modules and see what suits you. You might be a Ground pounder or a Fighter guy. Or maybe a rotor head ? You can go back and fly some of the older gen planes as well. New modules are being brought out often.Some tips I have are:- Take notes !!!! - Get a Stick (even a cheaper one)- get yourself a headtracker (TrackIR, Facetrack(homemade TrackIR)- As much as you all love steam, I recommend getting the standalone game as you will be able to use all the avaliable mods on the forums (terrain, texture, sound, liveries) - register on the forums so you can see what new content there is from the community ( mods, screens, vids, news and projects) http://forums.eagle.ru/- if you are using a single monitor I recommend playing the game in Windowed mode(it is borderles so you wont see a diff) as it allows you to alt+tab a lot easier without any issues    And last but not in meaning. If you ever have time, check out the mission editor tool. It is a powerful tool where you can unleash all the imaginary missions you ever had. Has lurning curve as anything in this game.I've been flying the A-10C for 3 years(nearly 4) now and F-15C for year and a half and I am happy with the amount of time I've inversted in this. Don't be scared that you won't be able to do something or it is too complicated. No such thing. If anyone wans help or tips for those two modules I could help out :) cheers and see you in the sky. Shoutout to the 104th server, the best pvp server !P.S: If you wonder why I have so low game time. It is because I play the standalone version. I downloaded the game on steam just so I can write this review.Don't be scared to ask me any questions about the A-10C and F-15C",1

19946,Dungeon Defenders II,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewLoved Dungeon Defenders I.  Dungeon Defenders II is a steaming pile of poop.  It isn't ready for release to the public at all and I'm very, very unhappy that they charged a fee for a game in this state.  I originally bought the game months ago (it's 7/7/16 now), and as of yesterday the game is still garbage.  I feel insulted and I feel like I was taken advantage of.  I spent more than a decade making games professionally, and what I see in this ""released"" game is horrible.The biggest problem with the first game appears to be that the art direction (which I think is lovely) attracts an incredibly young player base who isn't particularly suited to strategy gameplay.  The sequel seems to be lining up to be the same mess of incredibly young player population who play selfishly rather than cooperatively even at the cost of losing the match, and prefer to have their characters speed leveled by high level games rather than earning their levels and actually learning how to play the character classes and the maps.I wouldn’t consider recommending this game to anyone for any reason in its current state.  After the game is actually in a completed state I would recommend it as I would the original game, if you have a player group already assembled who can play together, go for it.  But, as an adult  it isn’t worth the time to deal with the immature player population.",0
1106,Creativerse,2018.0,Got this game back when it was in devolopment. If i remember correctly blueprints where built 1 block at a time chests only held about 24 items stacks went up to 99 and there wasn't any new content like the galactic bundle and so forth. I had played the game about 60hrs or so befor i had to stop playing due to increased work. Came back about a month ago and added over 145hrs in 2 weeks. The only thing this game lacks is the ability to fly or drive any vehicle you craft once this happens the creativerse community will only increase. Great way to keep in touch with family across the planet. I only expect the devs to come up with more great and interesting things for all of us to create and blow up.Yes i know i have no life but when your a gamer like me games are life. Highly recommended.,1

Lord of the Rings online is the best Lord of the Rings game out there, trailing ahead of The Third Age, and Battle for Middle-Earth.

You may begin your journey in the humble Shire, where you will experience the joyfulness and naivety of the hobbits. From there, or any of the other fine starting locations, such as Bree, you will slowly make your way through some of the most well-known and previously unknown locations of the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's famous fantasy land. Take a stroll through the Old Forest and have a chat with cheery ol' Tom or take a seat and drift off to dream land in the dreary atmosphere surrounding Old Man Willow.

14276,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access Reviewi really like the games stability but i dont like the current match ques for the combat set ups some times u will get 4vs6 or 3vs5 in a match that is supposedly a balanced match. also disconnected players that leave the game can not be replaced by a new member but should be in order to help with team balance.,1
16253,Magic Duels,2016.0,"Edit & further review after last content patch:Several Cards have been DELETED from the collection for balance reasons. Imho this is not acceptable in any Collectible Card Game. Make different formats, put in Techcards but don't delete items from collections.There has been only one patch since release - no further patches or bug fixes since 2 months. Feels like Abandonware.But there are several issues and bugs that NEED to be solved: List of bugs:- No chance to take a muligan when your enemy (vs player) leaves or disconnects during the start of the match.- Daily Quests not refreshing properly (not all 24h).- Documented hacks/cheats.- Match Making in 2HG isn't working in 3/4 cases and the process fails and needs to manually restarted- Disconnecting during a match lets you keep your rank (1vs1) - thus ranks are meaningless.List of annoyances & issues:- Daily Quest can only be absolved with Decks build in the ""Deck Wizard"" (no real deck construction)- No communication with Partners in 2HG- No Gold or Quest progression in 2HG- When your opponent concedes you need to win vs the replacement AI even if you played 1vs1 (and yes, so both players can lose ranks).- If you can't play a card in multiplayer the phases gets instantly passed - you can't play mindgames without having a similar card (e.g. Instant).- You can't add people you played with.Downgrades compared to ealier versions:- No Booster Drafting/Sealed mode- No Archenemy mode- No Planechase- The game feels sluggish, especially vs players.Overall Magic Duels feels far worse than the older Dotp games. Yes you can play with self constructed decks but you can't gain gold from quest with those. So you need to ""farm gold"" to actually play with the real decks.I love Magic the Gathering but this game is one of the worst implementations of MtG.This game feels like a halfhearted attempt to copy Hearthstone. And to be honest: Hearthstone is better in every aspect - why not play Hearthstone then?",0

The false advertising rubbed me in all the wrong ways however; this game is not free to play (unless you like a hiking simulator dressed up as a hunting simulator). To actually hunt in this game you have to spend real money on licenses, guns, etc. I'm hoping in the future that this game will actually allow you to hunt a bit more without spending money (or just costing money right off the bat).

316,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewWell, I have almost 100 hours ingame and I have more than enough of it.I got maximum wins in draft (which is basicly arena in hearthstone), Best rank possible in ranked plays and although hearthstone and minion namsters are different types of game, they are both the same rng crap. In ranked, you started playing against deck that counter you? Good, you can leave game, no chance of winning or reason play. In draft, do you have better opening hand than your oponent? Good, you win, next game.Most fun is at the lowest leagues, where people are just playing and trying everything and because there is NOT game mode where you can just try other decks you have, you MUST play ranked, so if you reach diamond and you want to try another deck, well, hello silver.You can see leaderboard ingame, which include decks of players there and that mean there are just bunch of idiotes copying decks, which lead to extremly boring game.After you saw 2 times whole animation of opening chest/power token it is just waste of time to watch animation of 5 chests opening and using 40 power tokens, (you can skip part of animation of power token) Since i got annoyed by it i dont buy any power tokens and after you finish draft mode, its much faster to just ALF+F4 game and re-open it than watch all the animations.And not metioning that some masters/cards are extremly overpowered and devs have no interest to fix them.Overall:- gameplay- animations- when you reach higher rank in ladder or more wins in draft, you basicly play against 2 or 3 different people+ you can really quickly get all the cards and masters+ artstyle ",0

2027,World of Warships,2018.0,"Product received for freeBeing a LONG time War Thunder player, and having played World of Tanks in 2014 partly, it's safe to say i know what i'm talking about when it comes to World of Warships despite my low number of hours. Within 4 hours i reached Rank 3 Battleships, and level 7.I downloaded the game expecting it to be like most other Vehicle Combat games on the market right now, with health bars and just shoot where ur cursor is, and to an extent that's the case here. Now you could say War Thunder has spoiled me with it's Interiors and modular system, but to an tiny degree WoWs has it too with guns being knocked out and fires spreading. But it's not quite up to WT standerds of having each crew being able to be knocked out and shooting at direct points of armour to hit a small ammo rack or feul tank. Now it does Have Armour but not X-ray. Well It keeps me happy that the HP bars aren't too overused.But let's get real here, nowadays EVERYONE talks about Graphics or FPS. For me, BOTH were above average. I got arround 30-40 fps on the highest settings and it looked great ! But still not a solid 60 or 200 ... War Thunder has this issue too, so i will let this one slide.Although the game does hold your hand annoyingly in the first levels. When i started the game, i was fustrated because i couldn't even access the Tech Tree until i was level 2. I spent atleast 20 minutes looking in the game settings and their video tutorials for where the button to it might be hidden. And when i DID get the tech tree open, it's shallow AS ♥♥♥♥. There is like only 10 ships of 1 type per type FOR 3 TYPES or if your lucky and picked America or Japan you get Aircraft carries ......... Even though britain ruled the waves, they still don't have a flushed out tech tree.Now even though the i am from England, and the British Empire did have the largest navy in the tree i could atleast get the famout Hood right ? The biggest ship in the Navy ? Well the Japanese get the Yamato and the Yanks get the Iowa, BUT NO the Hood was made a premium ...

1441,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2017.0,"TL;DR - Game is pretty fun if you can get past the free-to-play-mobile-port design of it, although it does have some glitches from a technical perspective.This is a port from a mobile game. I have played the mobile game before, and wanted to try it on PC because the screenshots honestly looked pretty good. The problem with the mobile version for me was just the terrible UI design which really emphasises the free-to-play microtransaction-packed design of the game. The moment you enter, you'll be bombarded with all sorts of ""you just got free gems, you just got free tickets, there is a sale going on, go and buy some packs, this game has more visual and auditory cues than an actual casino"". I despise it when games turn into service platforms and this was what made me deinstall the mobile version. Not only does the PC version carry over all of this nonsense, but it also crashes randomly, the screen where you actually see the world, the menus etc. is limited to the center of your screen, and the sides of your screen will literally have the Duel Links logo slapped onto them haphazardly, so it's clear this was never intended for wide-screen play - this is the default and you can see how the design of the controls was also intended for smartphone play. It's all flashes and effects, and it simply doesn't suit me. I would rather if it had a plain design and just focused on the actual game.As far as the gameplay is concerned from a collectible card game perspective, you will likely enjoy it a lot. It's Yu-Gi-Oh, after all. And you can get plenty of things to get you started for free by just playing the game, although it all becomes a whole lot easier if you're ready to purchase card packs, just as you would do in real life. It's not a bad game. It's the design issues that put me off.",0
7395,Magic Duels,2015.0,"Well the thing about this     particular Magic spinoff, is it isn't neccessarily Magic.But what makes it good to me, is it is its own IP.It adds its own kinda charm as well.Even though the sets are limited, and you are bound to get doubles more often, the deck building interface itself isreally user friendly. The gameplay is also overlooked as well, because since there are some things that aren't in the original Magic, peopleget offputted by this.  But this system is actually great, in my opinion, for new and veteran players alike, even returning players like me. Even though the cards aren't the same, the basic rules  set a sorta nostalga that I was longing for.The only bad thing I have to say about this, is the quest system is a little confusing, i.e  I don't know what Paragon is, or Archetype, or Archetypal, and i don't seem to be getting 40 coins, for winning 2 games of that deck type.So yes I think that part is kinda confusing , overall, it's pretty good for what it is.( Overalll I liked this version of Magic, operative word ""liked"" , since there is no more updates, it's pretty much a dead game.

1083,Magic Duels,2016.0,"Although the game has some software issued in regards to gameplay and crashes, I still do recommend it to any avid MTG fan, and to new players wishing to learn magic the gathering! It is a major improvement from older versions of the game! Grinding for cards is easy and even a casual player can complete  his collection pretty easy in order to compete to the higher tiers. As many may think this affects the game's replayability, wizards is releasing new sets instead of yearly re-editions of the game - as it were in the past-, so be certain that you will always have new cards to farm and new deck/strategies to develop.In addition, they finally introduced Planewalkers to the platform, yay!!!",1
15841,Robocraft,2016.0,"It was a great game when it aired. It had armored blocks and all sorts of little thing to get your tank/afv the exact right way. You always ended up with a slower heavy tank with loads of armor and a big♥♥♥♥♥gun or a light agile flanker. The gameplay was balanced and fun.Now however they changed the payment mode, I earnt loads of in game cash by grinding and playing and after some update it was all gone, they replaced the whole damn system for some weird unlock system, making it feel like all pay-to-win mobile apps.And now they deleted half the blocks and options including all armored blocks. The game is unbalanced and feels like you're in the middle of a moshpit with laserloaded mechs. And have I told you about the amazing added paint option to replace the coloured armored blocks with 3 stupendous colors unless you want to pay for some red, blue and green?Pros+ Only like one GBCons- Everything else in the game",0

4246,War Thunder,2017.0,"Now personally i would rate is a yes, and i really want to give it that thumbs up, because the game is really well done, and I dont mind a good grind. flying some of the planes and driving some of the tanks that youve worked for is really fun and i enjoy the game. The only reason i dont recomend the game is because of something that the game has no real control over. The Community.The community that the game has with it is extreamly toxic, espcially if you just want to destress and have a fun time. With aviation specificly, i feel that seal clubbing happens, atleast as this reveiw is written, very common. I back this up with flying a plane can be easy, but pulling off some of the manuevers that are rather hard, even by todays pilots, is not something a first time pilot would know of, or even complete without some practice. To further back this up, I've ran into a lot of pilots who have DAYS recorded just playing fighters or attack planes, what is fine and all, but vs noobies... its like having stealing from a baby. The game rewards players, both tankers and pilots in a way for seal clubbing by letting them use the XP they gained to further the tank/plane that they are currently reseaching, but tanks can only research tanks and planes, planes, respectivly.I personally dont think i will stop playing the game after this reveiw, i really do like playing the game, its just if your looking at getting the game, know that some tanks and planes are sometimes put into games a teir ahead, or behind of what its ment to be, what is good if you are flying a C .50 with a BR rating just slightly under 2 at 1.7 (i want to say) and your facing biplanes with a BR rating of a flat 1.0 with rather flimy struts. Also know that you will be doing a lot of grinding for that plane or tank that you want to play, but like mentioned earlier, you dont have to buy the next tank to keep progessing down a line, or getting a better verient of plane.I think the game would improve more if instead of sprinkling in some planes and tanks here and there, and adding a new teir (what i have no XP and wont for a long time with), maybe increase the variety of planes, and add tanks (if they historicly had them) to the italian line. Another thing that i think might me nice, would be to group people up by if they are just starting a nation, and only have the starter tanks/planes. just so its more of a learning enviornment. I dont really know how to make the community less toxic though... maybe punish freindly fire or something, i cant suggest anything really, its more or a person thing, not a game mechanic thing...If you still want to give war thunder a try, i highly recomend trying it out, just be warry of things,-Wolftron",0

5139,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewWhelp, what started as a hopeful replacement for the terrible current meta in hearthstone, i have put enough hours into this game's ranked play to conclude it's even more poorly balanced than yugioh, and even very low ranks are infiltrated with decks and players far in excess of what their ""rank"" belies. I'm strongly familiar with MTG as i have decades of experience playing it and am no slouch with strategy, timing, counterplay, bluffing, etc. While i credit this game for having the kind of depth that hearthstone lacks, it is a shame that the game is otherwise wrecked by awful balancing and match making. There are some absurdly powerful decks and combinations, and wouldn't you know it, 5/6 players you meet are playing cookie cutter top meta builds. This is identical in nature to hearthstone where players with 52+% win rate decks intentionally concede their way to lower ranks for the purposes of easier grinding of in game currency and quest completions off potentially lesser skilled players YET should they be interested in players of comporable decks and skill they need not procede up the ranks, as everyone is right there with them at the bottom. This game continues to suffer from the usual issues you can expect from a MTG knock-off (mana-flood/drought) happening way more often than one would think possible, and utterly avoidable considering the digital formating, the games quickly devolve into whom can be first to inact their imbalanced strategy or who is last to fail to achieve the power resources they need. This game's design philosophy seems mired in a swamp of developer ideas of ""what would happen if we made late game strategies possible by turn 2?' Genius. Also, Pay2win in the extreme. Not recommended for casuals and non-whales.",0

6067,SMITE®,2018.0,"It pains me to write this review after the hundreds of hours of joy this game has brought me but I feel I have to. This game used to be close to perfect. If I was feeling competitive I could hop in a round of joust or conquest. If I wanted to relax after a super draining day of studies, nothing made me happier than hopping in a round of Arena with some friends. Now I can't even enjoy a casual game  of arena with my friends. The servers are garbage; a game without unplayable lag or connection issues is a holy grail. There are blatant balance issues. Arena is the most played game mode, yet there are clearly a handful of characters that are so op in it that you'd be a fool not to play them. People recogonize this and so you can count on consistently going against the same handful of gods, making for boring and repeitive gameplay. There's also almost no penalty for leaving games (a 30 minute ban? That's it?), so you can count on about half of your games being 4v5 or even 3v5. I hope HI-Rez fixes this game because a lot of dedicated fans, including myself, are just going to go play League instead of putting up with the frustration of attempting to play this game.",0

2176,Crush Crush,2016.0,"Pros:This game is one full of beautiful waifus and I can finally fulfill my dream of becoming a lesbian for url women. These girls are so cute and I am a big fan of all of them so far except for Bearverly who is just not my type. I enjoyed the short backstories leading up to how I have ""crushed"" each of these beauties as it really helps me to connect to each of them in a different way. My favorite so far must be Quill, the cutie, but my oh my the size of them cans on Elle! The game is split very well into the different sections of things to do with each girl (flirt, gift, date) as well as also having things for me to do outside of their view (jobs, hobbies). Outside the main game, I enjoy the ""stats"" option where you can customise yourself, and I have noticed the avatar seems to get more attractive the further you progress.Cons:Money is a huge con for me. I find that I never have enough for some of the late-game waifus; eg. Bearverly with her 50 Chocolates demand (the fat thing) took me almost a week to do. The same with hobbies; eg. Fumi with her Level 24 TechSavvy demand I still have not completed and to get a hobby from 1-20 you need to have the game on almost all day when I just don't have timeslots to waste on that. You also unlock characters too quickly in my opinion, they should be unlocked slower so I don't have to date 10+ at once. A woman needs a break you know, these girls can get demanding! Finally, and this is just a personal thing that I tend to dislike in most games, I don't like the reset option. I understand that this makes the cooldowns faster and the job times quicker but then you just lose the connection with the girls and have to start again. It makes me feel less connected to them when reading the story twice (or more) and it feels like everything I have done so far is just a waste!",1

20200,Path of Exile,2016.0,"This is what d3 should've been. The best arpg out.. and it's free?! I'd say my 1k hours in this game and all the experiences with it are well worth it. If you are not familiar with arpgs, I will have to say this game appears very confusing with the sheer amount of content the game has to offer. However, this curse can also be a blessing because the amount of customization and diversity is absurd.Not only is there a ton of customization the game has to offer, but the amount of content that GGG produces is enough to keep you entertained like no other game. Path of exile comes out with a minor expansion every 3 months and along side the expansion, new leagues are introduced where you can start a new. The new leagues have a theme to them and introduce new challenging content that players must overcome. Every 6 months, path of exile comes out with a huge expansion.A concern for free to play games is that they are pay to win. Poe is FREE TO PLAY. You cannot purchase in-game currency with money and you cannot have advantages other other players simply because you invested more money in the game. I will admit the 4 stash tabs you are given are not near enough to sustain a storage system in the game, however you can spend $16 to triple your stash tabs, and hey, this game is kickass so why not support it so GGG can develop more content. This game is play to win, not pay. Please GGG, don't stop the development of this marvelous game, it's everything an arpg wants to be. THANK YOU",1

10443,World of Warships,2017.0,"It's not world of tanks with ships. I thoroughly enjoy the game for being more of a strategy game than an action game. It has a relatively long time to kill unless you're an idiot and serve up the broadside of your ship to a wall of torpedos, or a Yamato. It's all about paying attention to everything that's going on and always thinking four or five steps ahead, because it takes that long for a ship to get anywhere or do anything.Pretty annoyed Wargaming didn't support linking to existing accounts with the steam version (I confirmed by contacting support), but see the video on youtube about it by Ichase for a workaround.

5114,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,"I'm a WWII nerd so obvs I like this game, esp the WWII era of the tanks, you can some what learn some history if you do your research etc etc on the tanks, the way it was made, the reason why it was made etc, anyway personally blitz is much better vs World of Tanks (the normal one or whatever tf you wanna call it). Blitz is a much faster pace, with less players on each side and a much smaller map. Along with that theres no ARTYS aka ""artillery"" which is blessed bc artillery is annoying. Playing this game over the years on both the pc and mobile version not too big of a difference of movement, I guess thats the term idk, anyway cross platform of both pc and mobile version no big difference. Whatever your better at controlling either holding a tablet or ipad, or just keyboard, personally keyboard a bit annoying simply bc sometimes harder to move left hand away from wasd while trying to shoot the enemy tank while trying to dodge, so you kinda panic ish but whatever. Just depends your play style. No big issues with the game, lots of updates frequently not very bad, from time to time there are events or speical missions pretty cool tbh. Currently most annoying thing has to be ""afk"" ppl, some I will say are afk others are not an afk issue, simply bc sometimes not often but maybe every so month you start a game, you load and don't load in until maybe 30 to 40 seconds after the game has started, pretty annoying. Second most annoying thing is when ppl say ""oh your a pay to win"" buddy stfu honestly you literally have a tank that cost money too....... even than whats worst is they run into open dies within the 1 min of when the game starts than blames on the team saying yall ""camping"". Personally I think once you start out playing this game, is kinda meh or boring etc, feels ""grindy"" bc you need to get certain amount of xp to research something new than go to next tier etc etc. Tier 8 in my opinon has the most action all type of skill level, you have players that are new if they bought a tier 8 premuim tank (not really pay to win, bc each and every tank has a advantage/disadvantage against any other tank, along with that it depends on how you play and how your team is). For example, some players with heavy tank (Powerful gun, strong armor, but slow speed), some players will literally sit in the back of the map -___- not saying you can't, but you really can't win the round if your gonna sit in the back and let your light tanks, medium tanks, or tank destroyer die, now not all are like that, some are very skilled, they're able to read on what they should do, shouldn't do against another tank, others *sigh* they yolo it as in push 4 tanks and die right in the open while shooting once and probably never hitting anyone or pen against them.Obvsly you start off with low tier tanks when you start the game, but theres a reason, to teach you oh how the game will be etc, you have many nations that you can pick (USA, USSR, FRENCH, GERMAN, CHINA, JAPAN, or BRITISH tanks) each one of those has there own special ""perk or skill"" For example German tanks, very heavy armor with strong armor, same with the soviet tanks, the french however are less armored, BUT they have a ""mag shell or autoloader"" as in they reload maybe 17-20 seconds depending what tank, but they have the ability to move fast pace and shoot total of 3 shells in less than 5 seconds, as in lets say the AMX 50 100. You have 4 shells total in a mag, it takes 17? idk something around that seconds, but you can shoot 4 shells, you shoot once, than it takes 3.3 second to reload the next one and so on, until you shot all 4 than it reloads again with the full 17 seconds. Very overpower in its own way, if you have the timing, but can be annoying bad in times as in close combat or 1 v 2 just depends. Now the British tanks, very good, but they have one of the most if not most of all the tanks fires less than 7 to 9 seconds. Which as you get to higher tier it gets annoying and you'd want to take the british tanks out first simply bc their gonna keep nailing you before you can even reload the next shot. However some tanks like the Americans and Japanese tanks, you wont really see much of Japense tanks simply bc they kinda suck, however for American tanks you wont really see any tier 6 or 7 tanks, I hardly ever see any, simply bc every tank for any of the nation beats it. *COUGH COUGH* fix T20 bc its useless, but leads to the M48 Patton which is very good, not only that looks good too. Other than those tanks, you'll see a few tanks which don't look WWII era or ""stupid tanks"" However its nice to see different tanks instead of going against the same old tanks. Overall for customization, does not look bad, very different from the other World of Tanks, less things to add, but here the camos don't look as bad, they help you in the game, along with that I really look forward when they can create attachments for each tanks, like IS3, IS6 all the attachments looks sick, the American Eagle looks great on some of the American tanks, but position very odd. Kinda sucks that all Tier 10 tanks have their own Legendary Skin and attachment. If wargaming can make it so the customization is same for both platforms on blitz and the normal orginal one, it'd be blessed.Somethings to note about this game, there is rank, however not many ppl play it or atleast it takes awhile for me to get into a rank game. Theres 2 modes, team deathmatch and supremacy mode (capture the flag, theres 3 or 4 depending on the map first to 1k points or to knock out the other tanks win). Graphics aren't too bad, looks the same from my eyes on pc to mobile, sadly on pc version you only get to 60 fps max. Bit annoying at times when fps drops but whatever. Another thing, you won't be placed in a match in different regions, never had that happen, never really had bad ping unless you play mobile without wifi aka not at home or idfk aslong as you play with wifi done you have good connection. Replay is nice, you can sometimes learn from mistakes on what you did etc etc, by rewatching the matches that you played. PS it is not a ""Pay to win game"" I haven't paid a single dollar to get from a tank to another tank in a tech tree, I only pay for the tanks that I really want aka lets say the scorpion, is a new tank that came out a couple of days, I had a dollar XD, was so stupid litterally just click and BAM got it with 1%, ppl get salty bc you get it and they couldn't but whatever. Anyway as I was saying only time you would pay is for getting more garage slots if you really want to keep every tank that you have gotten, PS you wouldn't really keep every tank, theres no point, just some tanks you play you will hate and once you get enough xp for the other, you instantly sell it XD. It just takes time to get enough xp for the next tank, not only that you need enough credits to buy it and have enough to resupply ammo, camo, gears etc many factors go in it. <---- also why people buy premium tanks is bc it gives good credits so that way you can ""grind"" faster. But you don't have to buy it you have a 1% chance from a crate idk off top of my head but free crates every so day, week, so you have a chance.",1
5771,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"So....I heard about this game quite some time ago but I didn't really bothered with it because I heard it ran terrible even on high end rigs.Has it changed? Not really, it's still pretty laggy and I just can't get it over 35 fps in fights and that's quite dissapointing...But if you don't really care about that (like me) you should be fine :)Gameplay:The gameplay is good, it's just a good first person shooter with alot of people in one war to conquer a whole map.The battles are huge with sometimes 50 vs 50 and you will obviously die alot but it's not frustrating to die like in other games where you want to throw the controller (or whatever is on your desk) away.Graphics: I have almost everything on Ultra and then the game will look very nice and detailed.Effects and explosions are realistic but I'm not so pleased with the sound (it's okay but not great)Final verdict: Great game but you will need a serious PC if you want to enjoy the most out of the game.Specs: Pentium G3258 (overclocked, 8GB Crucial Ballistix and the GTX 750Ti.",1

It's great, the only con I could think is the lacking animations (but they're working on it apparently).

19592,Neverwinter,2014.0,"Although the game is still going through some changes by releasing more stuff for you to buy, but I find many faults.  The most used classes are anything BUT archers.  (Trust me, I'm using one, and it's terrible.)  Most of the skills you're using are good to use, however, they're the only the best after level 10, the skills afterwards, or points you use, is weak and useless, even in Melee, it's just as bad by not inflicting damage, no matter how great your runes or armor, even weapon is.  The thing is, and what is making the genre of MMO's fail, is instead of fixing these problems, they instead turn to releasing more stuff for you to purchase and getting those isn't cheap either, for a new class, it's around $60.  This is what I'm finding the hugest fault in MMO gaming, (and Maplestory does way better at fixing this by being told there's problems and they have over 15 classes already I think.)  I will give it some credit to gaming art, story and very unique worlds, however, there are so many problems, some of the dungeons are terribly crafted in terms of boss fights (Grast the Gutwhatever is the main issue..), the tracking system does go out of whack, no safe paths when you want to avoid enemies just to go back to the NPC without the pain and hassle of taking on more enemies, that YOU just killed three minutes ago.. and the level cappage is just.. *sigh* (And there are enemies that are above the cappage, when you're still 60.  How the hell does that make sense and way tougher than you, PW?!)It's good if you want some uniqueness, but really, PW, you were doing fine with Perfect World, what the hell happened here?!

I won't type out all that I loved about the Old Robocraft. As I won't put a deep feeling of nostalgia to me, and of Hardcore fans.So, here it is......Robocraft is dead to me now.  It has lost ALL OF IT'S appeal to me.  A year or so ago, I played this non-stop.  I enjoyed it to the point where I would wake up 5 in the morning just to play this.Now?  HAH.  No.  They put a !@#$ing crate system in this game.  WTH.  I don't want that !@#$ in ANY game!  And they also screw with the physics to the point where VTOLs are no longer possible.  WHY!  WHY FREEJAM!  GET RID OF THOSE AND PUT BACK THE LEVEL SYSTEM!Ok.  Now that I got that out of the way, I'll tell you what I adored about this game.2014, I saw this in my recommended games.  Looked at it, read the description, and what I saw was that they put Minecraft, and robots, together.  That description did no justice to the game those precious years ago.You would have somewhat incredibly intense games in the higher tiers, trust me in this, before they threw out the leveling system it was adrenaline inducing.  Three years later,  ""Hey guys!  We decided to f@#$ up the game even more by adding crates!""Why........ just.....why.........  We early Hardcore Robocraft fans understand where I am coming from....  It really makes me sad to see this game RIPPED away from me!  I am torn between giving this a jab in the face, or 100+ hours.  Meaning: I really, really, really, really want to give this game a thumbs up, but now, I... Just can't.  They messed things up when A lot of us hardcore fans said ""NO!  Please don't mess with it like that!""  When a friend told me that there isn't really a tier thing, meaning that any level can play any level, and that ANY level can use ANY itm, tore me.IN LOVING MEMORY,       The Old Robocraft. (2014-2016-ish years)                 Freejam, if you guys read this, change it back!  It was much better then!  Honestly, it was a lot better with tier separation and level requirements.   Please put the level CPU back!  I can't give this game a thumbs up now.  I'm sorry. ",0

But oh god, it's even worse than it was before.- The meta is incredibly *bad*. Rotation is usually done in games because it's the easiest way to keep the game balanced, but they messed it up so bad that it's not even funny.

They are all the same, classes all have their one gimmicks and they repeat the same samples for cards over and over again. Oh, and did I mention how luck-based the cards actually are...?- RedShell is implemented. If you don't know what it is, it's usually been called as a ""marketing tool"" by developers, but it's actually more: it's a spyware, recording data not just from your gameplay, but also OUTSIDE the game.Would I recommend the game? Not at all, in fact, if you're not an active player, I'd advise DELETING it until they solve the last issue in regards of RedShell itself.

17213,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access Reviewrealm royale is a game trying to take on the new battle royale simulations that have been blowing up, its takeoff was ok, but i soon started realising that the game is not really that fair, if you have the better weapons, spells, or health then you basically win. if a person that has all the attributes i listed at the top then you somewhat lose. this game isnt primarily on skill and some luck, its just mostly about who has better things in the game. the only thing that takes skill is aiming to some extent, since there are spells then if you miss a shot just shoot a fireball and fly away, i also would wish that the game would award you more for choosing a class, some classes have certain abilities and thats all they grant you. if there were counters to different classes i would see lots of variety around the map. but all i see people using are assasins and mages because those are what the popular youtubers use like ssundee. also just an added note this review is done pretty late, i played the game when it was basically in launch, i just hopped onto steam today and wondered. what was up with realm royale, i saw the reviews for this game being pretty mixed, so i just decided to make a review so people know my experience and make thoughts if he/she should download this free game. feel free to comment your thoughts on this review or even make a whole other review yourself even.

4701,War Thunder,,"thunder, where to start.  (please read fully, as there are somethings I think need to change)This game used to be REALLY fun back when it first came out, way before tanks were introduced.  I used to love playing this game as it was basically World of Warplanes but not autistic.  The grind was almost no existant as you would get your next aircraft almost immedeatley if you did well enough.  I used to love playing with friends as realistic battles were super fun an not old a drawn out as time went on.  However, now, this game is just... sad.  The grind fest is real and if you dont have premium time, preimum tanks/planes, or some advantage, its almost impossable to get any XP.  I know that Gaijin want to make money but I mean come-on.  After tanks came out I was actually thinking the game was going to be so much better, but in recent years the tank gameplay is the exact same:  load in, dowtiered, kill 1 tank, get 15xp, die, rinse and repeat.  The plane gameplay is just about the same, load in, kill 1 plane, die and do it all over again.  Now unless you play only arcade, its somewhat breable, but realstic is God awfully broken.  There is no teamwork, everyone is out for themselves to get the new ""amazing"" super sonic planes, or the new cold war tanks.  I mean, who actually plays online games in hopes your team knows teamwork as a word, but its really bad in this game.  Other problems include aircraft ammo.  I mean the .50's are decent, the 20mms are lackluster, and you just want to forget about the German 30mm cannons.  I am not by far a wheraboo, but the German guns tend to suck... HARD.  Sometimes you can literally dump all of your ammo into a plane and it never dies, or 2 rounds of ammo blow the plane up, literally.I hoped Gaijin would actually listen to the player base about fixing issues with the game in terms of battle modes, ammo, and tanks, but all they seem to do, is come out with ""new"" maps or planes/ tanks/ helicopters.  The battle modes are.... well.... special.  Its only one of two or three modes.  Assault, moded assult, or horrid assult. WHat I mean by this is, plane modes are all the same, destory bases, destory the airfield and you win, or kill all the other team.  Tank battle only consist of attack 1, 2 or 3 points.   If you dont get atleast 2 points and hold them, you are DONE.  ANother problem in the tank mode is the SPAWN CAMPING and when I mean its bad, ITS BAD.  Gaijin tried to remedy the issue by putting in a zone around the spawn for the enemies to not enter, and if they do, they die.  But its 30 seconds, REALLY?  30 seconds?  It should be instant death, not only that but make it to where when you spawn in, your tank is protected until your LEAVE the zone.  I know it says I don't have a whole lot of hours on here, at least on steam, but overall I have around 6k-10k hours on this game.  Not saying I know all about this game, but I think I have a good sense of what I am talking about. What I would change are as follows: - I would balance out the ability to make money/ exp, you make more per battle as it used to be.  - STOP putting in new planes and tanks every patch, so those that are ""possibly"" op can be investigated and ""repaired"".  - Balance out ammo, and make it to where all the ammo preforms close to historical abilities.- Ammo for tanks will be ablanced out to historical battle field capabilities as well.  Armor valuse would be recorrected into their historical abilities.  I know this is a lot, but this game has SOME REAL potential, but they (Gaijin)  isn't willing to fix the game.  Thanks for reading.   ",0
4455,Fractured Space,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewHello folks,I can highly recommend this game.For an alpha it is one of the best games ive ever played.Gameplay:The different ships classes, play different (lel how could guess that).They are well balanced with some little issues in balacing.Fractued Space's gameplay is variable and you need to work with your team.It makes fun to fly against all types of ship and to explore the possibilites of your shipclass.At the moment you proceed very fast in gaining new ships, experience and credits (ingame money).There are some things missing like Matchmaking / friend / clan / lobby systems but for the current stage of development (game was first avaible 11/2014 when i can trust my informants) it is good. Graphics:Ive play the game in ultra aswell as in minimum, the graphic is overwhelming good.Only asteroids are not that pretty at the moment.The graphics remeber me of Star wars and star treck.Sounds:Weapon Sounds and the engines of the ships seem like the generel sound and sound average,Servers:Since the newest update the server's seem stable, i got no laggs and dc's.Developers:The dev's seem to work hand in hand with the community,there are certain events like clan vs dev's or community meeting.Kind regards Challenger",1
3242,Star Trek Online,2014.0,"Big, lore-heavy (and Lore light), and goofy. It's not the subtle intergallactic diplomacy styling of the TV shows; Star Trek Online takes more after the movies with more action and more conflict.This isn't a bad thing, the space combat has become more and more satisfying over the years and the complexity of situations improve every mission.The ground combat has improved enough to be fine, but isn't the most enjoyable part of the game. This is where the crew you bring on missions are helpful; they balance a lot of the quirks out and allow for some customization. In reality, if you take ground combat partially seriously it's alright and there's no real penalty for wiping on mission so the problems are ignorable.Since the game has been around for a few years, the ships available are many and wonderful. If you wanted to fly ships from the Dominion War perfect! Want to play a period-specific Enterprise from earlier shows and movies? They have that too.

2777,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAbsolutely ingenious, amazingly fun and overwhelmingly addictive game. The gameplay is well balanced, the graphics are gorgeous (Unreal Engine 4) and the sound design is mindblowing - imagine a huge Destroyer ship jumping into the vicinity and opening up its broadside bombardment on enemies to save you from certain death - the feeling is undescribable.Premium elements do not in any way give paying players an unfair advantage, as their effect is strictly cosmetic or time-saving (getting more XP and/or credits so you can get your desired ship(s) faster).I got the game for free to keep during the free weekend in January, 2016, but its overall quality convinced me to buy the the top tier (Vanguard) Founders Pack very, very fast. The only problems I have come across so far were related to matchmaking, but usually went away quickly. I would also welcome an addition of bigger lobbies in the game (you are currently only able to invite one friend to join you in an epic space battle).    Bottom line, Fractured Space is the first game in ages which I am seriously hooked on.",1

6759,Realm Royale,2018.0,Early Access Review7/3/18 Alpha Build Reviewafter working myself up to diamond 3 and a playtime of 30 hours i figured i should give a little review for this game.rather than listing every single pro's and con's (that are subject to change during the alpha and beta anyways) i am just gonna point out the major things that Realm Royale in my opinion is doing better than every other battle royale out there.#1 - The Forging System : the forging system incentivises you to stay on your toes throughout the entire early to mid game. you are forced to actively look for fights to craft your legendary armor and weapons. camping in this game is heavily punished in the late game as you will be at a huge disadvantage compared to the players that actively did look for kills to craft their stuff.#2 - Map and Circle : with an average gametime of around 20 minutes per match Realm Royale is probably one of the fastest battle royale games out there. the circle actually hurts like hell in this game which means people will rarely unexpectedly sneak up on you from behind as gas camping is nearly impossible in this game. the map itself is relatively small compared to other battle royale games which means if u will sometimes unexpectedly find yourself outside the play zone it is not necessarily a death sentence.#3 - The 5 Classes : in realm royale you can pick between the warrior/engineer/assassin/mage/hunter class which all are unique and fun in their own way. while certain classes like the engineer are easier to get into than other classes the variety of class specific abilities aswell as class weapons creates a very high skill ceiling for each individual class.#4 - Overall Gameplay: unlike other battle royale games that incentivise you to find cars around the map each player has their very own horse they can ride to move faster from forge to forge which as mentioned in point #1 leads to more fighting and therefore low downtime between all the stuff you have to do in this game. the sound effect are very loud. it is virtually impossible to sneak up on somebody as you will be able to hear their footsteps or shots from miles away. this in my opinion leads to less frustrating death experiences as its promotes a fair chance for each participant of the fight.these points alone make Realm Royale the best battle royale game that has been released since h1z1's early beta and offers everything i was always looking for in a battle royale game.- fast gameplay- more fighting than looting- high skill ceiling- no wall building bullsh*t (*cough* fortnite)keep up the great work HiRez,1
14112,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2016.0,"THis is a great game, with major problems.  It is nearly 10 years old and the expansions are fantastic, however, the bugs are almost intolerable. The servers go offline and online a lot due to the datacenter moves, you would think 10 years in that most of the bugs would be worked out, but, not.  That and players using bots all the time and whatnot, I fear this game is dying. The forums are full of negativity toward Turbine.  It isnt cheap to subscribe, and you get little or no support.There are a huge amount of players that adore this game, but Turbine are killing it.",0

6735,WARMODE,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game is not original, fun, and or exciting. The game seems like an obvious CS:GO ripoff, and doesn’t seem to stop copying CS:GOs motive. Too much loading times, terrible graphics, and too many hackers on it. So do I recommend it to people? The answer is... no and yes. Let me explain, if you are low on you’re steam account and can’t afford CS:GO. Then this would be the great alternative for you. But, if you already own CS:GO, it’s not really recommend for you to play it. Since it already has the same motives and traits to CS:GO. But anyways, my final review score for this game is a 5.5/10 and hopefully the developers will improve these problems and add something different to the game. And take what I said in a mature and polite way. Remember this is just constructive criticism, I don’t mean to upset or put anyone down in this review.",0

5826,Fractured Space,2017.0,"Fractured Space has come a long way since I first started playing this game. At the time of this review I have 155 hours played since it’s free to play release. Here are my thoughts on the game:While loosely formatted around a MOBA, it doesn’t necessarily feel like I’m playing a MOBA. Rather, FS plays more like conquest in Battlefront 2: you fight the enemy for control over certain areas, which leads to gaining control of the battlefield and eventual victory (I have yet to play Battlefront 3 so I can’t make a comparison there). While the mission doesn’t change, the way you play can widely vary based on your ship selection, and team compositions. Each ship feels balanced, however some ships or classes of ships (read stealth and snipers) have steep learning curves on how to actually contribute to the game. Unlike some other games, when Edge Case reveals new content, especially new ships, I get excited to play again. Unfortunately, with a lot of new changes comes bugs, many of which have been persistent. There are also some features which I feel should be included but aren’t. In game voice chat would be huge, as well as a server browser to allow players to fill in for an AI pilot. That being said, I feel like Edge Case has been putting forward a lot of honest effort to get the game to where they and the players want it to be. Pros:•Fun – blowing away capitol ships is awesome•Gameplay rewards skill and teamwork•Balanced ships and content (mostly) means this avoids being a pay to win•All ships available on standard currency, and currency grind is fairly easy•Relatively consistent updates with exciting content•Great communities available on Reddit and DiscordCons:•Bugs•Lack of certain features such as voice chat or server browsing•Premium currency (Though with this being a FTP, I have no problem supporting the devs)•SaltClosing Thoughts: My review here is lacking some information as I have never actually played the second game mode, Frontier. Since this game is FTP, there is no harm in giving the game a try, and you may actually end up enjoying it. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes piloting big ships and blowing up other ships. ",1

13837,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"Simple and short review:This might not seem like it after you've played 40 or 60 hours and it starts to get boring. But trust me, there is so much more to the game. When I started playing it, I didn't realize this was one of those easy to learn, hard to master games that I love so much. It just takes some time to really get going though. Joining a good outfit is a must though btw.",1
2152,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's not a great game and honestly it's a step back from the original. However, DunDefToo does grow on you a bit. Finding rare loot and pets feels nice... but loot is so overabundant that you stop caring about anything that isn't mythic/legendary. The game has an auto-collection feature but it doesn't let you choose what is collected/left behind. This means you gotta sift through the garbage to make sure you didn't miss a pet or pet food (they don't have an indicator on the screen/map to make them easy to track).The maps are all super boring, small, and mostly tight spaces. This is problematic because players and towers have collisions on them. So, the game gets crowded very quickly.Players get their own mana (currency for making/repairing/upgrading defenses) each round and it scales based on the player count. This is pretty nice and you can hand it off to the other players. Sadly, the game is totally anti-social. A single player can (like the first game) change their character to place additional defenses. The players also have a shared point limit for placing defenses. So, most of the time you either put up with bad placements or a single player doing everything. Basically, the game stops being tower defense and more about doing nothing or going combat focused (killing things yourself). This was a problem in the first game as well, but those maps were usually laid out in a way that a combat player still retained value.The pet system is god awful. You need special materials to ""evolve"" your pets... this sounds cool, but you need a resource called ""shellium"" which is obtained by letting pet eggs expire. This means you have to give up the chance at an interesting pet for some resources... and it takes 48 hours of sitting in your inventory to expire. Pets occupy their own special bag space, but eggs take up normal bag slots. Leveling up pets requires food... food does not stack with itself and therefore takes up extra bag space. The eggs can be hatched instantly between matches (in the tavern after you reach a certain level), but the timers could change. The timers used to be 8 hours and you can only hatch one at a time.So, your inventory will consist of the following:* Garbage items for upgrades/selling* Eggs* Cosmetic item boxes (requires premium or daily quests to open)... you'll get a lot of these.* Quality items (so you can use a different build.* Pet Food* Pet Food* Pet FoodIf you want to get materials to upgrade pets then you'll spend even more space on eggs.What the game sells for a premium:* Character slots (5$) - you get enough for each class at leas* Bags - 2-5$ depending on the size of the bag* Pet Bags - 2-3.5$ depending on the extra space you want* Costumes - 10$ or more for costumes* Pet Skins - 2$ or more depending on the costumeAt first glance the game seemed pretty fair (monetization-wise)... but with the inventory problems and sheer cost of space it began to feel greedy. Like they sacrificed usability to sell more things.Physics/Networking:So, the game is prolly hosted on a server rather than on the leader's system. This wouldn't be so bad, but the game's server is authoritative and the client has to obey. This means rubberbanding, or worse, the server sends you flying forward because it didn't notice that you had stopped. This means that input lag exists... and it's pretty awful. It's like they built the game on an old-school architecture without realizing that there are superior options.The game has large, blocky, collisions for everything. The characters slide (prolly input lag) around and so it's not uncommon to throw yourself off of a cliff. When your character attacks they move a little bit and the animation can't be canceled. This again, leads to the feeling of input lag (this is animation related rather than server related though). Basically, ranged attacks function better than melee attacks.Bottom line:It's a skinner box disguised as a game... a game with poor physics and networking. While it's free-to-play it has a lot of greedy elements hidden in there.",0

14590,SMITE®,2018.0,"Late Beta was more balanced, I'm not even kidding. I have above 1k hours if you count the time before it was released on Steam, if that means anything.Every new release obsoletes a couple more gods, with a third of gods two tiers above the rest, I think I am done with the game for the time being. There are less and less skillshots, which were the entire reason people play SMITE above other mobas. This is your average MOBA now, half of the skills are unmissable if you have opposable thumbs. Personal outplay potential decreases every season, everything is positioning now. If you aren't playing with premades, don't bother.There are gods that have been competitively unviable since their release, there are gods that stay as top picks for years, get nerfed for two months and get buffed back immediately.

1775,Magic Duels,2017.0,Long time magic player and I cannot recommend this game. Magic is about creating decks and improving them as you go. This game does not let you do this for the story mode.

4170,Dungeon Defenders II,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFun with a group of friends, but not that great for soloing unless you are willing to create multiple characters. Much like Dungeon Defenders 1, interactions between towers and the involvement of the player brings a new variable to what would otherwise be a traditional tower defense game. Average run length for each map is much shorter compared to DD1 (about 20-30min vs 1hour+) and the game overall is quite short, though there is decent replay value. Visuals and gameplay mechanis are much improved but the high degree of customizability that I loved from DD1 is reduced. Relatively a worthwhile purchase.",1

2876,Star Trek Online,2014.0,"Personal Rating: 6/10I've yet to play more of this game and I'm definately looking forward to it. While it is missing some essential characters such as Kirk or Spock, the impeccable voice acting and character emotion is amazing. Naturally, like all MMORPG's there is a lot of collecting x amount of y monster. But it doesn't feel overdone or underdone in this game. I'm not a Star Trek fan but I'm enjoying it! The combat is fluent and the dialogue is near-perfect.However, there are only two things wrong, small things, but non the less they are essential. The frist point being my character has no voice and for such a star studded audio presentation it deterierates into laughable situations where it's a very serious moment, everybody panicing and there's me, stood there, emotionless and voiceless.My second and final complaint it the ship. I hate controlling the ship, it just feels clunky and I can never get it to the right speed.But other than that it's a thoroughly enjoyable game (so far) and I'm looking forward to playing more of it. Unfortunate lack of Simon Pegg though.",1

But worth a try thou.Edit: 7 hours into a game, tried multiple decks combination, some are my own, some are pre-set by the devs, and this game is double penetrated in terms of balance. Of course some cards in other games are op and broken but this whole game is based on that. There are decks with a 0% chance to win against, it's just that, you have to get ready to press concede with diginity rather than watching your health drops -30 or something.

123,Business Tour - Board Game with Online Multiplayer,2018.0,"blatantly rigged. There are times where you do either extremely good or insanely bad, there's never an in-between.it's as if the game decides who's gonna win based on some hidden algorithm, then makes all his opponents land on his tiles meanwhile the preselected winner lands on his cities, empty tiles or chance tiles.oh and if it's your turn to lose, good luck with that. The dice rolls do their best to make you land on the tiles with the highest rent, and if you land on chance, 90% of the cards will be bad such as the one that makes you land directly to the city with championship.If you start last that's a red flag that the match will be rigged against you, so don't even bother.this has happened so many times that calling it a coincidence would be pretty naive.",0

13461,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2017.0,"If you love puzzles, this is the game for you.If you just love shooting things, this is probably not the game for you.The basic premise of this game is simple... dissassemble and reassemble every kind of gun imaginable. From notable historic models, to modern military pieces, even a few vehicles, and some skeletons, this game has a lot to offer anyone who loves fiddling with intricate models, and looking at how things work.It's got a few negative quirks, though. As others have noted, the game is very unforgiving to those who don't want to pay for microtransactions. If you're just a casual player wanting to look at all the different models, expect to pay a lot.Even if you're really into the puzzle aspects, expect to throw down a few dollars on occasion for that really nice model you want to try out.Another negative is the inconsistency between models. Some models will require you to pull apart every single little screw, bolt, flange, and spring. Others will do most of the detail work for you, dissassembling large amounts of items with one click. It can be especially frustrating when trying to get the higher difficulty achievements, to figure out just how much attention to detail a specific model wants you to have. Planning and memorization are key.If you like puzzles, though, and aren't afraid to shell out a few dollars now and then, pick this up. You'll be engrossed pretty quickly, I guarantee.",1

4235,Shadowverse CCG,2018.0,"I think this game is much better than HS, easier to get cards, better client (faster, responsible). Not just recycled another game (like HS did with WoW). Current meta based on DBNE seems prty good, i like it. Cant tell for previous ones, didnt played at that time. Overall this is one very solid CCG. So far no regret for money invested to it, can't say same about HS....Main characteristics about game:- anime style (good quality, rly nice waifus)- its faster (usually games end pre turn 10)- evo mechanic for tempo plays - u can have 3  copies of legendary, which makes decks more consistent, not like in HS, when playing secret mage and praying to get aluneth to play it on 6turn... (on first sight it seem it makes it more expensive as in HS but trust me, its not the case)- prebuilt decks (good for noobs, i started with it, totally worth, especailly when u have no clue about game)- classes are different in way that you can actually feel it, u r not just playing different cards- lot of free stuff, much much generous comapred to HS, especially for new player! To start as new player in HS u need 400+ euro, no joke, thats fkin reality! So far it looks like u need to spent about half in Shadowverse as new player to build even some most of expensive decks, like summit haven for example.- ladder makes sense, u r not losing points when new season begins (why would you? your skill dont drop over night, right?), also it uses sort of 'elo' systems, not 'star' system, which i personally hated in HS- during match u have access to battle log of whole game!, u can see graveyard,u can watch replays of matches (only last 10 plaed)I may a bit sound as HS hater, but trust me, HS and blizzard did that all alone.... and thx to this i found Shadowverse, so thank you blizzard :)For me this is go for CCG.

There are times where I get framerates closer to 40-60, however, these times are few and far between, and only take place in desolate areas without players, vehicles, or even the simplest structure. I have other complaints about this game, although I'm sure other negative reviews already cover them, so I'll leave it to fellow dissapointed players to voice their opinions on the matter.

DCS and third party have done a excellent job of extending the catalog. Make sure you read up on each module before you buy though as some may be more geared towards your style or bug tested.Be prepared to read, youtube, and find great people on the servers to teach you how to use various systems. Since the release of 1.5 (2.0 alpha in testing standalone) the performance has taken a huge leap (almost double my frame rate) it looks fantastic and really shows the future of this engine and just how well it uses the hardware in your rig.I highly recommend downloading and buying at least one module to support this fantastic team and all of their efforts.",1

17818,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst off, i have to admit, i was hyped for the game after reading myself into it and ""accepting"" the ""old"" model, tab target and instanced MMOs. But in the current state, rather wait for a moment. TL;DR included down below.The hype dropped along with the way the CMs handled the communication pre-launch, censoring is still ongoing.I will keep it as objective as i can be, knowing the past of the game. Obviously i ignore the typical launch issues. Those happen with every game, recently Dauntless.To the performance;But now to the game, it failed in multiple regions already, it is using Unreal Engine 3 (Released around 2006-2007?) and DirectX9 (Released along side of Windows XP) So you can imagine how the performance looks like.On an i7 8700k it barely utilizes 15% of my cores, most of it is on a single core eitherway. So Clockspeed > Core count for this MMO. Towards the graphic card performance; The frametime jumps across 5ms-170ms on a GTX 970 @ 1440p, even though V-Sync is enabled. The FPS drops down towards the low 20s at times, even on lowest settings, while doing nothing but starring at a wall. Some people i talked to have worse issues, some have less. To the game itself:Unlike popular belief; this game is not Pay-To-Win yet. Lets hope the developers keep their word, unlike the developers of BDO that put pay to win elements into the game after a while. It plays like the typical 2005 F2P MMO you would expect. Rather stiff, tab target, themepark. The graphical side is obviously not on the highest note, as you can take out of the engine and directx version used. It offers an relatively open world with no in-between loading times, even though I would probably recommend using an SSD to prevent atleast some texture pop-ins or ""loading barriers"" once the pre-loaded area has been exited. The reworked combat is a hit or miss, you get a set of ""pre-made"" combos you can switch around with stances. Quite cool and switching up the rather dull tab target model. But the biggest issue i have encountered is the translation. Beside the performance and the UI, those are the biggest problems. The translation is horrible. And i mean it. The tutorial on some classes even tells people to put skills that dont exist into action bars. ""You are 4Level"" is also one of the funny translations. It is plain lazy.The UI:Playing on a 1440p screen, i am used to have small UI's, and i prefer those over big and clunky UI's anyway. But this game scales the UI to the size of my resolution. The Inventory alone is almost 1000 pixels in height. The UI is NOT customizeable. TL;DRI wouldnt recommend this game to anyone in its current state. There needs to be a lot of polishing and the developer needs to keep their promises of keeping this game free of ""Pay to win"". The performance is a mess. Mostly utilizing a single core on an i7 8700k.The UI is big, clunky and lacks userfeedback, it is not customizeable and may cause lags upon opening certain windows.The gameplay itself is pretty much the typical 2005 F2P MMO",0

15611,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2014.0,"***EDIT-2015***If you had told me at the time I first wrote this review that things were just about to turn around and that this would become one of my favorite games of 2015 (and hopefully later) I would have had you committed.But that's exctly what happened. Big shake ups went on at Simbin and the company is now called ""Sector 3"". But more than that, whoever it was that made the majority of the wrong decisions about this game must either be gone or he/she has seen the light.I have changed my review to reflect the great advances this game made. I will also write a more comprehensive review at some point in the future, but for now suffice to say that this game should be in every race enthusiast library.-------------------OLD REVIEW BELOW-------------------------------It pains me not to reccomend this game. I own every single Simbin game ever published and I still race in a GTR2 league with weekly races where we manage to have 30 to 40 rivers per 1h or 1:30 hour race. Every week, year around.Naturally, GTR2 is showing its age, but it is still the only racing simulator with day/night transitions, full pit experience, large fields and all the other features that make a simulator awesome.We waited for GTR3 for a long time and we were very excited by Simbin early previews of their new sound engine. It was truly something to behold.Then GTR3 fizzled and Raceroom Racing Experience came out as a ""free to play"" game. Initially I was quite impressed. The sound was awesome and far superior to anything else out there. The graphics, while not the best, were better than their latest offering (the Race07 series). The car handling was OK. Nothing too advanced, but passable.Even as a free to play game it had promise and initially we belived it would become something at least playable if not a substiotute for GTR2.After the launch, which only included hotlapping as an activity and an ""Apex hunt"" game that, while a good training tool, seemed forced and certainly no substitute for the missing features. However, since it was a new game  I even purchased about $70 of content, betting on the upcoming and promised availability of AI cars and multiplayer. While we knew that as a league we would be looking elsewhere for our future platform, R3 held the promise of being a good offering for casiual online racing.Then time passed and the only new offerings were cars, tracks and ugly, useless ""liveries"".  The promised AI is still (as of this writing) missing in action and there is no multiplayer to speak of, just boards with hot lapping results.The choice of available cars goes from the uninspired (cars that every sim seems to have) to some unique cars that are indeed exciting, except that they all seem to drive like one another.Frankly, if I could go back in time I would buy only the Zacspeed Ford and the additional hillclimb track. The free cars are OK, with the BMW hillclimb car being the best of the lot and the hillclimb challenge is really the only bright spot in this game. Considering that the BMW and the hillclimb are free, I would suggest thst if you like the genre you download this game, but don;t buy anything else. Maybe the other hillclimb track and a car or two that you fancy. All the rest is just repetitive and uninteresting.There is no weatehr, no day/night transitions, no pit stops, no telemetry to speak of, even the liveries, which are not free and there is no way to design your own, are ugly. To me it is truly unbelievable that a company like simbin released this stillborn game. It could have been so much more, but in truth, they fooled me into spending more than double what I ever paid for GTR2 so maybe they made their money from me for the next two years. But no more. They released a DTM game that suffers from the same limitations (it has AI, but it is very weak) and for the first time since I ahve been simracing I did not buy it.Maybe one day they will come to their senses and they will offer the same features as GTR2 offered almost 10 years ago. Maybe they'll relent anmd let players create their own liveries and the promised ""Adaptive"" AI will really be what they promised. Maybe one day you'll be able to compete against other humans online too, and maybe even at night and in the rain. Maybe.When that happens, buy this game. Until then, perfect your hillclimb skills (that is really a lot of fun) and save your money.",1
4810,Fractured Space,2015.0,"Early Access Reviewfractured space is a space opera moba. except there are not enough ships on the map. total of 10 at a time more ships = more fireworks =more fun. the visuals for the larger combat arenas is fantastic. the controls are good with the exception i would like the ability to add more inertial the the ships or turn off their inertial dampers. After a couple updates there are a ton of ships now with only the one sniper being incredibly annoying to fight against as it can tick off half the health of most ships from accross the map. The game has gotten another game mode that is a little more singular but more modes could help.So long as you have a decent game you can earn a new ship regularly and there is a shared exp system for factions that is for both ships and ship upgrades. Unfortunately the one thing i usually run low on in between upgrades and ships is in game currency which is earned at a slower rate than exp and is slightly earned differently somehow. Honestly the attachment of currancy seems more like licking at the coattails at more established games, mainly other mobas and the only other need for it is getting crew which is permanent status adjustments in lew of the normal in game status adjustments which is replaced with just normal leveling dictated by a team shared resource system. meaning its harder to carry a team as you are always the same level as your allies even if your the only person working towards winning.the only real reason i cant really recommend the game is the stupid prices of the premium content. 15 dollars for a skin is rediculous. the game is 10 how can it be suggested that 15 is a good price for a model changing skin. pallet swaping skins are still only 5 so thats still silly. 5 dollars is #1000 premium currancy and buys 1 #990 palletswap skin or 9 sets of 4 #110 boosters. so the boostes may be worth it but its a little weird that you will always have a few bits of currancy left over. also as far as i can tell 1 booster is 1 match so if this is your game of choice you will end up burning through them.",1

516,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"Downloaded it a couple days ago, played 16 hours straight, It's very smooth, addicting and huge MMOFPS, It isn't just a FPS, the game works a lot like real war, Infantry need air support and tank support to take locations, in total they're hundreds of locations to take, faction choices are more preference based then gameplay changing based, you get some different looking stuff and some factions have better stats towards items that there faction is advertised to be.You cannot log into this game as an experienced FPS player and expect to go 40/5 score's like you might in CoD or other related games, this game is about teamplay and stratergy, they're 6 different unit types all of which can counter or push or '' sneak '' the enemy to help your team/group/unit/outfit (clan)/faction take an objective.I still don't fully understand the game which is a surprise since I'm one of those kind of 40/5 players when it comes to FPS games on the PC, However this isn't a game where you call people noob or get godly scores, infact most people don't get good scores, the game says you can die a hundred different ways and it's practically true, the game is about the real-war vibe, soldiers attacking objectives, dying over and over until air and tank support finally take over.Sound: 9/10 - Very realistic and immersive, makes you feel like you're in an actual war with the lights off :PGameplay: 10/10 - Can feel unfair at times, but the over-all goal and experienced is more then achieved by the game.Combat: 8/10 - Again can occasionally feel unfair but not unabalanced, luck can help as-well as group play.Air Combat: - 11/10 - So realistic and responsive, requires a lot of learning and practice to dominate.Tanks/ETC - 9/10 very realistic but can't be effectively fired using third person, shutting you down from your surroundingPay2Win? - This game is free to play, some guns are £ cash only but a lot of guns are In-game credits, you will find yourself somewhat grinding here, I was only able to unlock some gun attatchments and upgrades after 16 hours of gameplay, however the '' beginner '' guns are very good, they're not made crap to force you into buying, you could happily and easily use all the beginner items forever and be a good player, however I feel some cash guns do offer advantages but it's strange, The pace at which someone can die is never changed by the gun, some guns just assist the person, meaning if you're a good FPS player it won't matter, if you're a new FPS player or a bad one, you will often find yourself over-powered by cash users, over-all not anywhere close to P2W.- PS, The sniper unit can cloak small vehicles and fire from them whilst remaining cloaked, sniper units can also use some rifles, being stealthed with a rifle for me is a broken aspect of this game and one I do not enjoy or support.- Sniping, it's nothing like call of duty or other FPS games so if you're a quickscoping fanboy don't bother with this game, Sniping is very realistic, you have to aim where your opponent will be, bullet travel time and distance vastly affects your aim, also most beginner snipers do not one shot unless headshot, but do lot's of high damage, which is how it should be, like air combat, sniping actually requires practice.Over-all rating: 9/10 - Completely free to play, no hackers that are overkilling the game, lots of stratergy, groups and action, Not pay2win, addictive and balanced, feels like CoD + Battlefield, best of both worlds, with slightly less graphics compared to say Battlefield, I'd say on max settings this makes any CoD game look '' simular ''.Graphics: I have a MSI Nvidia GTX 970 over-clocked at maximum overclock and I get 100-120 FPS with very high settings in fights of 1-12 or 12-24, I get about 60-80 fps in fights of 24-48 and 60-70 in fights of 48-96 and 96+The textures of the game are somewhat '' ugly '' compared to other games, but this is often misunderstood as a bad thing, you have to load about 30-400 players in one somewhat small objective area at one given time, including the sky, the tanks and turrets, mines, the map itself, the rocks and map design and fillers including helicopters etc ALL MOVING at once, I feel the textures are bad for a reason, the game is unplayable on any standard/none gaming GPU, (AMD/Nvidia) is required at atleast about £70+ per GPU (2 GPU's) or £200+ for one GPU to run the game at an eye pleasing level.

Movement balances being realistic and responsive unlike pubg, Netcode isn't complete trash, I live in NZ and playing on both the roe Asia and NA servers is far smoother and more playable than playing on pubg's OC servers.The game manages to look nice without have the performance of a potato battery. Consistent 60+fps, no frame drops or lag spikes.The ability to select the general area where you spawn and see where others are spawning is nice and cuts all the boring parachuting crap (you can spawn on top of teammates but not enemies). There are several gondola lifts around the map aswell as interconnecting ziplines, (sadly) no friendly fire.Its a f2p game and has no pay to win mechanics and none of abortnites horrendous fashion. Infact right now the only way that you can actually spend money is on the founders pack which is like 2.50 USD.Vehicles are very forgiving, in that it is extremely difficult to tip a vehicle unless you are a class A retard or you are deliberately trying.There are 3 packs (classes) which you can choose when you load into a match:Gliding - Hang glider - Start with a glock (9mm) - High mobility - Low capacitySkiing - Snowboard - Start with a usp45 (.45 acp) - Medium mobility - Medium capacityClimbing - Pickaxe & ability to use ziplines - Start with a double barrel shotgun - Low mobility - High capacityStarting weapons don't make much of a difference as it is extremely easy to find guns, you will very rarely have to use a starting weapon, unless you are deliberately trying to get kills in the first 30 seconds.",1

341,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis isn't the main game that I play, usually I just jump on this game with friends to have some fun and relax.With that in mind, the most important part for this game is the developer involvement:DEVSTREAMS: Every week the developers stream for an hour. The stream has gameplay in the background, a camera that has two developers answering questions from the chat and forums, and another camera with a game developer working on game assets (designing weapons or making animations).DEVLOGS: These are a bit more informal and usually just a sentence or two. But every developer posts what they have been working on that week. At the very least it lets you know what is coming up soon.INFLUENCE VOTES: For logging into the game (and the forums) you can get influnce points, then the team has public votes for different systems that the community prefers (how loot drops work, how to acquire certain items, etc). So you can just save up your points and actually make quite a considerable difference in something you feel strongly about.All of this in addition to other videos for events and whatnot featuring developers answering questions on the forums or emails. They also have a department dedicated to going through every bug report sent through the in game system, the game is going to be in early access for quite a while, so it is nice to be able to follow along.The game has bugs and isn't too terribly rich in the content department right now, but it's still pretty early in development.",1

Event are usually fun and well worth your time and gold. Fun to play and very generous; I turned 2 packs worth of gold into 6 packs this past weekend. Playtime on here doesn't reflect my time playing on the very good mobile client.Mana screw / flood does happen. It's the price you pay for completely open deck building. It can be frustrating, but games are quick and it's just a game. If you want a low variance card game, play something else. I've played hundreds of Eternal games and I'm glad each one played out differently.The tutorial and opening hour(s) of the game are not great though. It just goes on for way too long.

You must play this game for 50-100 hours before you can even think about deciding if its a game for you. It is very competetive, and sensitive people will not enjoy it. You will be insulted, a lot. If you get to a high lvl and have played many matches like me, you wont be paired up with Peruvians or Russian quite as much, but at the beginning there will be someone who doesnt speak English (in a U.S. English server) and they will most likely suck and lose the game for you. There will be heros that will wreck you every game until you (and those idiots you call allies) learn how to play against them. Even after all the hardships, I'm still playing this game. Those 700 hours? I found this game 6 months ago, 500 of those hours only on the weekends, even with school. It's a fun game, but people suck. Enjoy",1
14906,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewLong story short: don't play it.Crosshairs and running are a nightmare. When you get shot, you don't feel any impact. Scopes shouldn't be dirty. Should have more video options. Why does it need a launcher, then the game opens and you click options: almost nothing. You start the game and it opens even another window. Game is super hard to run and at this point, I would say it's not worth it to play this game, although it has potential.",0
119,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewBest free to play battle royale on steam without a doubt! Here I'll list some great features about the game that make it so good. Without listing the obvious ofcourse.- Not a walking simulator (the game offers other machenics to cross the map that other battle royales don't offer).- Different twist on the start and ending of the game that make this game play different, but very familair.- Currently the game has a snow map which is atleast uncommon for battle royales.- Active devs! (sometimes multiple updates per week)- Has a grid system for the storm like Radicle Heights (R.I.P.) had.- Guns will show snow and your vision will receive a frozen affect when you are in the storm- Multiple teams/players can win a matchNow some things I dislike about the game.- The game has an auto-lean system. Either make it an option to manually lean corners or get rid of it.- Suppressors aren't that ""suppressive"". You can still hear the gun shots from a couple 100m away.- Still a lot of Helicopter camping, which they reduced by the ""adrenaline"" feature. - The game could use a ton more of optimalization, but it is playable.- Helicopter view when you have climbled the ladder is pretty OP. Although it might be realistic it is pretty OP in duos and squads.All and all this game is a lot of fun and has the most potential of all early access games without a doubt, due to the fact it is of Tencent.

9861,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,Early Access ReviewKeeping in mind this is early release the game has great potential.  At its current state you get to a point and just aren't able to get needed upgrades.Pros:- on-key for new players- follows a progressive map unlock system- fun to play- very easy to pickup the important concepts- depth of play is above averageCons:- horrible party match system (end up in the same game which shouldn't even be possible unless you select to join the same one)- lots of legendary drops but very few useful ones (less would be better if you get that 1 you need),1

540,H1Z1,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWhen I first got this game a few months back, I was having a blast. While the game was glitchy and a bit overpriced, I was happy to give support to a game that was trying to get some community help, and would eventually sell a FREE product. A couple of weeks ago, the game slpit into 2 parts, BR and Survival. I personally only played the survival once and I didn't really have that jolly of a time, and I primarily played BR. However, while I now own both parts of the game because I was grandfathered in and recieved both seperate games, I find it absolutely ridiculous and unfair for them to split into 2 games, charging consumers more for games that are buggy, terribly optimized, and in some cases unplayable. I believe that Daybreak has not hired any new developers, so what was the point of splitting the games into 2 if the same exact people are working on the 2 seperate parts? I would be a little bit more understanding if they hired 100 more developers and we got concrete evidence that there will be changes that benefit the performance of the game but so far that is not the case. This game made a HUGE MISTAKE breaking into 2 parts, and unless they recombine the two games, I do not recommend getting either version of the game. Hopefully Daybreak will learn their lesson and stop being greedy idiots who make a money grabbing game.",0

8178,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access Review(From PC and Android)So ive expected this game since it was announced.Can i recommend this game ? Yes and No...Ive played Adventure time, Dragon fable and Adventure time World. All of em are awesome games and its nice to see everything 2D coming to life in 3D.But and its a big BUT. The game isnt finished i cant really say its even in open beta... too few locations only 3 starting classes excluding the Guardian which is premium class. Unneccesery crafting system that takes real time...AQW had crafting and it was fine and it didnt require waiting... The wait time is probably just to extend the game as much as possible at this stage. Im kinda use to the game being unfinished cause i played in the unfinished (beta) version of AQW. Still Worlds had way more classes available at the beta phase more locations more quests everything more. For the time this game has been in development i expected a little more.This game is a good time waster tho, there isnt much you can do in the game at the moment but i expect a lot more content in the future. I expect this game to have the same amount of content as AQW cause that game is absolutly briliant. AQ3D only has the name the feel the humor and its a true cross platform ( I play it on my phone ) A potato can run this game but thats all about it for it.It has stupid unneccesery crafting wait time and gear is focused more on grinding materials now (Which isnt that bad)It has too few locations and key locations dont exist the town isnt even finished half of the buildings are still ""COMING SOON"".Back to my question ""Do i reccoment it ?"" Yes if you love Adventure time and you are willing to waitNo for the new players to AQ games cause this is bare bones game with very little content at the moment ( Just wait )Go play AQW till this is finished.Overall for this review ill say No.20/10/2016.",0

It is indeed what HS (and MTG, YGO, online) should be. If you play for a while you get heaps of free packs and cards so you don't necessarily need to spend any money on the game. I stress how good the mechanics and lack of RNG is in this game. Yes, you do sometimes get mana screwed but that is simply part of the game. I would like to see an in-game tournament function",1

19532,Fallout Shelter,2018.0,"First, let me say that I liked this game. It's a new take on the Fallout universe and it's fun to build. It was highly addicting, at first, but quickly becomes monotonous. Nothing ever really changes. You have the occasional attack by raiders or beasts that have little trouble destroying the vault door (with pistols or claws) and then go on a rampage through your vault. The dwellers on the floor will fight, but the rest just go about their business as if oblivious to the flashing red lights and alarms. The expeditions aren't any better. Six hours to travel to kill some raiders holed up in some SD Mart or office building. Of course, you can use some Quantum, which is rare and usually requires much more than what can be looted so must be purchased with real money or just wait and wait and wait while trying to remain interested in what's going on back at the vault. There too is a bunch of waiting to build skills so dwellers are more capable at their duties and more combat effective. I liked this game, but I cannot recommend it to any other than those with a lot of time to kill that just casually peek in on their vault from time to time. I played six days and lost interest. Have no real desire to go back either so my vault is probably dead or in dire straights anyway. In short, it's a shooting star that fizzles out rather quickly.",0
16413,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2017.0,"I really like this game, I play as a Beoring, fun class where you can switch between man and a bear form to unleash powerful attacks.

I think visually the game still looks quite good for it's age and has not aged poorly at all.",1
328,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewCan't recommend the game right now. (EDIT below)To name a few reasons why:- The game is unoptimized. Heavily. Probably the most unoptiomized game I've played in years. The graphics and visuals are okay, but even when you have a 1080ti - i7 - 16GB of Ram and good HDD, it stutters, lags, textures take a bit to load every time on characters, menus seem to stutter the game when you open them.- The server issues are bad, too. Frequent disconnects, I've tried on both 20/20 and 50/50 VDSL. Didn't matter one bit. If there are too many connections, there's good chance you'll be stuck at Splash screen, no matter your connection. The game doesn't try to reconnect again and you're forced to restart the game. That might also happen if you randomly disconnect after finally getting in, so ATM you have a chance to be one of the lucky ones to not be disconnected, or be the unlucky ones who gets to play 20mins out of 4h you spend logging in.- The translation is pretty bad. I suppose it could be forgiven, if the devs didn't say they spent 60 millions on getting the game to NA/EU.- The combat system was dumbed down. If you're looking for an experience similiar to BDO or even Tera, you won't get it, not afaik anyway. I looked and looked and couldn't find the ""action combat"" option in menus, while it was there in JP version. Right now the NA/EU version has tab targetting, and sometimes it doesn't work.- The voice over half the time sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom with an old mic too close to mouth, it's terrible.I think that's all. And if the devs really improve the optimization, server issues and translations, I'd happily change this review and try the game again, but ATM, for the price, Bless Online is not worth leaving other MMO's for.EDIT: - The game is still broken AF. The recent nerf of damage brought all classes to 50-75% DMG nerf which makes main story quests undoable as DPS.- The marketplace is set in the same way as GW2 marketplace. There are no set prices.- There is no account-shared storage. Also there is no player-to-player trading.- The game has HUGE memory leak, taking 7-13GB of RAM when just on.Here's a report of doing the first lvl 13 Dungeon as 4 classes, two dps, tank and healer.https://steamcommunity.com/app/681660/discussions/0/1696048879945286409/ ",0

So I persevered through the HOURS of downloading the patches. So I figured the game would run flawlessly for 11GB of patches.Well I was dead wrong. It is aweful. Lagging and GLitching like no other. I started the game and as soon as the cut screens began, peoples bodies were missing. Audio was cutting in and out. I continued persevering and hoped that those were the only problems.

The whole game can be finished in one sitting if it weren't for the repetitive quests, the multiple dungeon crawls for the items, and the crafting times.

3595,Dungeon Defenders II,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has for the most part been garbage, and a real disgrace to DD1.Most maps seem to be made with appearance in mind (and they do look pretty good) rather then gameplay, as good tower placement is all but forgotten in the map designs (which is of critical importance to a tower defense game).Combat itself is fairly clunky, leaving you with a lackluster experience as you run about hacking at waves of mobs.Tuning is evidentaly very poor, in most cases leaving you with either extreme ease or impossible difficulty. Difficulty, in this case, a result of being undergeared/leveled.Despite not yet even being released, updates have been centered around monitization schemes. The free to play is a bait-and-switch designed to lure you in to show you pretty maps, and then ask you for money.Trendy has gone down the drain hard.

9595,Neverwinter,2013.0,"Neverwinter is a good MMO and does not have any aspects of pay to win at all. You can get everything in the game by playing, but if you pay you can get that stuff a lot faster. Some bugs here and there, but the developers are actively hunting down bugs and fixing them. I love the Foundry Aspect of the game, which is basically a content creation tool for players. A player makes a quest or a questline and other players can accept the quest from various places in the game. I most definately recommend this game if you are looking for a good casual or even a bit more serious MMO to play.",1
10992,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,Early Access ReviewTo be fair the game has a good concept and I just love the little unbalace in this game.for example The german Tiger is stronger then the russian and american versions.but the fun thing is all 3 faction have their strenght en cons that makes it very enjoyable.this has decreased a bit since the steam launch though but the cons and pro's still exist.This game however is very grindy and that can be anoying or a blessing the devs keep adding new stuff so if your really like the game you have allways a goal to strive for but that can take some time.you can easily invest hundreds of hours into this game this way.also the game is slightly pay to win for example the veteran bonus (a subsribtion around 20-30 bucks for 3 months) that you will get gives you a extra credits gain extra experience extra warfunds game a 4th equipment slot and a second ribbon slot. the last one is most significant when it comes to gameplay because's each ribbon gives a quite nice boost to your character and the ability to equip 2 can make some weapon ribbon combinations 10-20% better in terms of K-DHeroes and generals is still a little buggy and in my opinion are not all changes to the lenght of the grind have been apriciative but it has a quite unique gameplay style and I have just spoken about the heroes side of the game.As the devs in hng saySee you on the battlefield ,1

1096,Trove,2016.0,"Trove is a good game, but it has it's draw backs. Many of which can be blamed on two things. 1. Some severe lag issues: For some people I hear the game doesn't even start. I haven't yet encountered that myself, and it runs fine for the most part for me, but there are moments where things just kinda break. Then again, try playing a game that doesn't have a glitch of some kind.2. Pay2Win: Now this I can understand. I have seen the market place, and it is very restrictive on what you can get without pouring dollars into this game. HOWEVER: Like Warframe,(I know, of all games, why draw comparisons to that one. Hang with me, pls.) you can do just fine without spending a dime. Of course, it will take a helluva lot more time to do, but maybe it's worth it.Despite that, I do reccomend this game, because of 3 things:1. Friendly: It is a very nice game. In every way it is warm. All nearby players get the loot that drops, and there is no fierce competition over that Shadow lvl 3 staff; death isn't overly punishing, and the game gives you a pretty good start, and then encourages you to engage with the community.2. Rewards cooperation: You get more together. When you're fighting with a team, all of you get XP, and all of you get loot. Even better, the punishment of death can be lessened when you have a team that can revive. Building becomes easier, and higher level characters can provide gear to lesser levels to help them gain rank.3. Appeals to a very large audience: Everyone: young, old, builders, adventurers, people who like pretty places and people who like hell. Everyone will have a place in Trove. There are many different classes for people of many different playstyles, and each one can be tailored via the gear you get, and the gem system. Threre are clubs for the different types of people, those who like adventuring will be greeted very well by adventuring clubs, builders can show off there talents to eachother at building clubs, and so on. And the best part is that everyone progresses through their respective intrests in similar ways, resulting in a place where different interests collide and then are sewn together in a rather lovely way.There is no way I could put this on the 1 to 10 scale and be accurate, so I'll give it a 89/100. Do the math, people!",1

4293,Dota 2,2014.0,"So here we are...I have started playing Dota 2 in 2014 and from that time, i have to say, it has drastically changed.We could have seen many updates and map changes going through the history, but by time the community got worse, with each update that has came, since people started playing just the overpowered heroes to complete their quests for compendiums and other♥♥♥♥♥♥BUT. Dota 2 is an AMAZING game with a lot of possibilites. You and other 4 heroes are defending your towers against other 5 enemy heroes and you try to destroy their towers, leading to destroying the Ancient, after that, you win and you can go play another match again. If you have friends, that don't mind to spend few cold nights with ya playing Dota 2, just grab them and start having fun. There are over 100 heroes in the game, so it will take you a lot of time to master all of them (after my 3k hours, i am far from mastering one of them, heh). Then there are frequent updates that keep the game fresh, LOADS of mods (official ones or community ones).Game is maintained and is definetly one of the best games for free you can find around.I have found that the game is quite distracting or way too complex at the beginning for new players. The tutorial just isn't enough to get you going, so if you have a friend with some hours already played, ask him for a help, because trust me, you will need it. Matchmaking still needs some work since it is unbalanced sometimes aswell as some heroes.This game is about keeping going. If you give up, you have no place in this game. If your nerves are strong enough and you can cooperate with your team (i know it isn't always possible, since the teammates suck often), you will have much better experience than people that keep raging.

I can't for the life of me figure out how people enjoy games that have a useless control sceme that is difficult to change because for what ever reason the game develpoers decide to make the menus confusing to the point that its hard to find what you are looking to change. ti should also be noted that it is another free to play game that goes by its stereotype; it isn't easy to play unless you spend well over an hour to even attempt to understand what to do. I wish that for once I can find an actually well made game for free that isn't riddled with microtransations.,0

829,Fractured Space,2015.0,"Update 09 May 18:       Much has changed since I last made any comments about FS.... I would like to say they have brought the game many miles and really changed, evolved and improved the game.  I still enjoy playing and the new wave mode called Last Stand is a great deal of fun and will test the best of players.  I've managed to reach wave 14 a couple times with some other skilled players.  A great bit o fun.  I would like to see some AI changes to the waves.  For now, they are predictable, which is okay, and part of how we can prep for each wave and attempt to push futher into them ... However, taking that to a new level of unpredictability would be cool.  Early Alpha Comments::So far the game is fun ... It does have more balancing to work out, but that's always typical for Alpha state ... Anyone who loves space games would enjoy it ... Maps are very limited right now in Alpha ... Latency is a HUGE issue ... my one true negative ... yes, its free service, and in Alpha ... but its very hard to play with horrible latency ... Crashes a lot ... to much, hopefully more polishing will fix these bugs ... and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part about the crash, once you drop from a server, you loose all stats from that match ... so if you are playing for 30 mikes and boom, you crash, everything from that game time is wasted ... NO way to rejoin a match ... hopfully this will change in the future when more of a solid state of the game is created ... So far, I like the game, it has much potential and I'll play from time to time and really hope for the best.",1
5365,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,"Over the many years I’ve been playing TF2, I’ve yet to get bored of it. Yes it will become repetitive but that’s not the point. What really is the point is the countless games you can have before you even get bored of it. With over 80 maps to play in TF2, plus the countless maps that were made by the community itself, you’re going to find it rather hard to get bored with. The countless options on each map and the unlimited options on both attack and defence, it’s a never ending war of what you will do next. With nearly 2,000 hours in TF2, even I am still enjoying every map tf2 has to offer, from gully wash to even manhattan in mann vs machine. I’ve never gotten over the countless hours I’ve spent in the game, trying to better myself at every class there is to offer. Over the many hours I’ve spent in TF2, it was more than worth it. Spending it with both friends and by myself enjoying the game. Pushing ourselves to the limits or just relaxing while we mess around in casual or even the community server. It’s endless, a game that won’t leave you bored with the unlimited choices you can make while you play this.",1

2475,War Thunder,2017.0,"86/100 - Yeah's pretty good.I guess I should probably say something about this game since my play time.I'll try keep it short but here goes.Positives:-Lots to do, lots to achieve. Over 800 vehicles. If you're like me and enjoy games with a grind to them such as Warframe or Runescape (not as crazy as Runescape though) this is a great time sink. It's kept my interest for a while now.-Best Pre-WW2 to Cold war era + free to play tank, plane and ship game (soon™) out there. It has its faults but compared to other free to games out there I honestly feel like it's carved its own path, for instance it doesn't feel to arcade but it's not overboard realistic, once you get the hang of it, that's when the map knowledge and strategy come in. It becomes fulfilling -Good graphics, not insane but it's much better than other games like it. Runs well on most systems too.-Free to play may take a while to progress but you can get premium vehicles and items by playing. The options for free to play are quite forgiving.Cons:-IS6. (hate that thing) In all seriousness some battle rating changes do need to happen here and there. -Imbalances, with so many vehicles one small change can set off a chain reaction so be prepared for some annoyances and frustrations. It's all part of learning what works and what doesn't. Updates are frequent and the PR has gotten much better, Gaijin do try to keep the community happy despite what others say.-You must rely on teamwork for some game modes, epically with American mid-tier planes (my god.) Be prepared for people you can't rely on.Tips:-You must research on tanks and planes in game to see armour values and top speed etc. Or else you leave yourself at a disadvantage.-Don't claim Russian Bias when you die to a Russian vehicle (or any other nation), play that vehicle and learn it's weakness first hand. I guarantee other players will show you where you went wrong.-IS-6's, T29's etc. have muzzle breaks on their guns, shooting these breaks their guns and gives you time. Again, look at the vehicles thoroughly. -The Youtube community is great for tips, I recommend Slickbee, TheOrangeDoom, NapalmRatte, PhlyDaily, Squire, McChickenBites to name a few.It's hard to condense what I think about this game but if you truly enjoy historical and some protype combat vehicles then I do suggest at least trying the game, it doesn't cost anything and if you are seeking a time sink then this is the game for you. If you've played World of Tanks or other free to plays that are around ww2 era this will stand out for you.Thanks for reading this far. Feel free to murder me in the comments.",1
12099,Paladins®,2018.0,"How do I sum up 582 hours of grinding, rng, questionable updates, wierd matchmaking and Fun. Now I have been playing when this game came out to open beta and Makoa was the newest champion of the realm. I got bored of playing games like TF2 for a while and wanted to try something new. I stumbled into paladins just wanting to see what the game felt like. And believe me, the first time you played this back in the old days (OB34+, assuming you were not apart of the closed beta) the game felt like a whole new experience. A 5v5 hero shooter with M.O.B.A aspects and a loadout system felt confusing at first. But once i got the hang of things, I just enjoyed the game more and more. What really sets this game apart from its competition is the customization. You can build loadouts and design your champions in a way that feels comfortable to you. Want a frontline to deal more damage? Want your flanks to be extra durable? Maybe you want to be the fastest thing alive and run around the map like a madman. Whatever you feel like, you can build you perfect champion to be the way you want it to be. (There are limits to customizing your deck and preferred loadout, but the way you make it is your choice alone). Of course, this game is nowhere near perfect, all things aside.  This game has alot of problems such as -Bugs (some of which break the game and some wont even let you play the game at all, i.e. wont start the game/crashes on open)-Balancing issues (some champions are either too strong and too weak, and not alot of people ESPECIALLY the crew at Hi-Rez understand how to balance something properly)-Strange updates (Essence system, the infamous OB64 patch, removal of the mix-and-match cosmetic customization feature, broken champions on release, buggy/weak champions on release, events/features heavily focusing on P2P players such as the siege of ascension peak/Rise of Furia, tedious grinding (i.e. Battle Pass 1), character reworks no one asked for (Viktor), ect.)-Matchmaking Issues (large skill gap in players, often times being paired with people of higer/lower skill ranks)Despite these issues I still enjoyed the game. Even if an update was bad or favored paying players, I still had fun playing this game. Paladins is a game that (at least to me), will cease to be enjoyable. Unitl the day Hi-Rez pulls the plug on Paladins, I will never stop playing and enjoying this game.",1

19884,Fractured Space,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewFractured Space is exaclty what it says in its description. You are in charge of a large spaceship where you have to decide where to postition yourself and when you fire to get the most out of your weapons/abilities. Inevitably this is going to be compared to star trek, battlestar galactica, dreadnought, star conflict but i believe that this game can take elements from these games/shows to make a unique game with a solid free to play system.Still in early access so keep in mind some things may change.Their are a total of 12 ships which have varying unique properties. Graphics, effects and models are fantastic with improvements to quality and performance every major update. Having more local servers would be nice (to reduce ping) but its quite easy to find a game. With each update the game gets better and better.Overall a great game, essentialy a moba in space with large spaceships with flashy battles. Love to see how this develops. The price for the forerunner and harbinger are woth playing the game but keep in mind that this is going to be free to play in the future.EDIT: updated with more current info",1

2168,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI first played this many months ago and decided to give it a try tonight, only to find they have added ""EasyAntiCheat"" as a requirement. While I get that client side anti-cheat software can be useful and seems to have been needed based on forum posts, I have considerable privacy concerns based on what EAC is requesting it be allowed to do on my computer.The software itself has full access to screenshot, keylog and google searches have shown the results are publicly available for all to see. The only limiting factor is their word that it only operates while the game is running. While I'm sure there is other anti-cheat software running on my computer (ie steam), the data it returns to any third party servers has never been Google searchable.I recommend the developers for Robocraft force a migration of their users to Steam and use Steam's built in anti-cheat instead of using a third party app developer who obviously has zero clue on how to secure data being returned to their servers. There's no excuse for that to be Google searchable.",0
602,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,"I..... I cant begin to describe how i feel. what i feel is that..... Tf2 is dying. Its hard to admit. I still love it, but the telltale signs are everywhere. Youtubers leaving, and hell. Shibby is basically a freaking battlefield 4 youtuber now! Like, seriously! What did we do to force him to play the generic military shooter that has been rehashed? Tf2 was great. It still is. Its, one of the most unique and innovative games, and well, its dying. Nothing lasts forever. Tf2 has been around for 19 -ish years and theres only a certain point to something. You start with a sketch. You expand on it, draw lines all over the paper, fill in the gaps.But eventually......Your run out of space..I hate to see a wonderful game die. But more and more actual servers empty, and more and more people go to trade, idle and VSH servers, the game slowly kills itself. Is tf2 still the 3rd most played game? Hell yeah! But so many of those people are congaing, or bartering over unusuals, and not playing the game. Is it the communities fault? No. A poor reflection of valves contribution and what just soldified the joke that ""Valve used to make games, now they make money"" Is the end of the line update, a poor excuse that could have introduced something that hasnt been seen in so long- a FINISHED map. Not ♥♥♥♥ing operation hole bound beta, or tile texture RD, but a real, somewhat new gamemode. But valve took it out because it was ""Too confusing"" They dont add weapons, only cosmetics and a ♥♥♥♥ing cheap attempt to suck up money through bonus ducks. I would hate to see tf2 die, because so many people are invested. If tf2 dies, so does the market. the 10,000 dollar spender who bought the burning KE. Smissmass was okay. New weapons. Yay. But once again valve seems to be trying to please us with half finished ideas with mannpower. Theyve brought too much beta, and we the people would much rather see a finished and drawn out map rather than a♥♥♥♥♥♥overpowered attempt at pleasing the people. I dont hate tf2. I hate whatever the cause may be for this wonderful deviation from the rehashed ♥♥♥♥ing military shooters like hardline and advanced warfare. Just please, valve, as great as community effort might be, it seems like your not trying. Please make it like the good ol days where You'd introduce a polished custom map that is valve standards every update. We have enough hats and festives. we need weapons, and maps, and gamemodes, and anything but this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just please. Ive gone through 2 game deaths in my gamer career. They were fun on the last days, moderators giving out planned items, it was amazing. but then they ended.

2851,Fractured Space,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI've had fun playing this game. I like the idea of a land grab game in space, using HUGE machines of war. It's a fairly pretty game; It's not EVE ONLINE pretty, but there are some gems: the the added detail of explosions and fires across your hull where you have taken damage is a nice touch, textures for ammunition and weapons is a treat for the eyes and the lighting is superb. The gameplay itself is straightforward anything but convoluted. controls accurately depict what youre trying to do: fly a massive spacehulk with the precision of needling a thread. It's easy to pick up, but difficult to master. most ships are balanced and fun to play, offering different aspects to take advantage of or to be cautious. The only thing this game is lacking is content, at this point. I've only played for a few hours, but i thouroughly enjoyed myself. when there is a little more meat on this bone, i will DEFINITELY be sinking my teeth into it!",1

13134,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewBefore Sept 15 2015 I would have said everyone needs to play this game. but after there last patch, well they broke the game. no longer are you able to level up properly, no longer are you able to make any currency needed to fish other spots.they over engineered the game to be to life like, ( sitting for a long time not catching anything is not fun.) If I want that I will go to my local lake and spend the day there, not on a computor.Now heres the best part, ALL the egomaniacs that got to full level before the patch, Now what the Deves to make the game haeder to play. thats right it it harder to catch fish, make currency, get leveled. see thier already on top, and don't want anyone else there.

If you can't do anything the way they want, be prepared for the immense amount of toxic trash talk headed your way. Also the matchmaking is broke as well. When i first got the game i was matched with other players that had put 1000 hours into the game. But on the bright side, the game is truly free to play. They're no pay to win aspects at all. You only have to pay for cosmetics like skins and ward skins. There is a diverse selection of gods to pick from so its garunteed to have a god that suits your play style. The game is constantly being updated to fix bugs and add new gods to the roster.

It will only happen for a short time so I'm not sure if it is my internet or not but I still experience it so I thought it was worth mentioning. The other ""bugs"" were definitely my internet. I would jump over a gap and make it and walk but then lag back and fall to my death. Don't let those ""bugs"" stop you from getting this game though.

2238,School of Dragons,2015.0,"After playing this game for 7 hours, I feel I'm ready to give this a real review. I want to love it, so, so much, but I just can't. There are so many problems with this game that it makes it unbearable. If they were fixed it would at least make a fan of the HTTYD series such as myself at least deal with the minor issues, but sadly, it's not like that. I'm going to list some problems as I think of them so please bear with me: · No Volume bar, it's only on or off.· Even when both sound options are off some sounds still play, ex. leveling up, your dragon's breathing, etc.· Random crashes, a lot.· Quest arrow will just not work sometimes.· When doing collection quests the NPCs sometimes won't give you the items needed, making you have to re-log.· Some quests you finish, just to find the same quest available again making the whole quest progression system very confusing.· Friend list is broken, like, really broken.· It costs gems (real world currency) to delete a character, wtf.· I had to delete my old character because the quest he was on updated making the NPC I had to talk to not appear thus making the quest progress impossible.· Quests are really boring, to be honest. There's no variety.· Membership gives you some unfair benefits such as 20% discount on ALL items in the store, access to some special fishing thing in your farm, gold bonuses.· Anything good in the store costs gems such as the compost, improved fishing rods, good saddles, and lots of other items that are basically needed to get ahead in the game.· Membership costs a♥♥♥♥♥ton for what you get, $10 a month, Jesus.· When you go to the credits section of the game you can jump off the cliff and forever fall through the world. This really surprised me and you would think that they would have fixed it by now. It's not.So now some good aspects of the game:· Fishing is kinda fun· Toothless is in the game AKA the best dragon ever· The UDT system is kinda neat but affected heavily by hackersThat's about it.Now, if you still want to go ahead and give the game a shot, go ahead. I hope you have a lot of fun. For the others still looking for a good kids game, I heavily recommend Wizard101 or Pirate101. Thos games are without a doubt the best kid friendly game I have ever played. In the end, I feel this game is incomplete and not worthy of your money, or your time. It's something that you would casually play just to have a little fun and not take it seriously or play it hours on end every day.

This game has had me addicted for the better part of 3 and a half years. While this game is extremely difficult and rage inducing, it is also incredibly fun and addicting.On the other hand, this game is very P2W (Pay to win). You start off having one character slot to make 1 of 14 classes and a single vault chest that holds 8 items that will not be lost upon death. It is almost necessary to purchase more vault chests and character slots as you begin to get better at the game. Not to mention pets. Once you have leveled up your pet, (Common -> Uncommon -> Rare -> Legendary -> Divine), it is virtually impossible to get past a maxed legendary pet without dropping some cash into this game. That being said, your pet, vault chests, and character slots cannot be taken from you, and will be on your account forever.Overall, this game is hard to get into, but offers some incredible game play that can last you for years.",1

18059,Neverwinter,2014.0,"Disclaimer: I’m only doing PVE content, so if you’re in it for the PVP this review will not help you much.It seems the main point of concern for most people is if this is a “pay to win” MMO?  Technically it is not and as most reviewers have pointed out, you can go to max level without spending a dime, though it will take you longer without the XP boost and a faster mount.  But if you don’t feel the need to rush to the end you will get at 80+ hours of free RPG MMO play time.  At max level spending money becomes a real option especially if you want to be more competitive in PVP or do tougher dungeons and don’t want to spend all your time grinding out Astral Diamonds.The Good:1)The Neverwinter Gateway web site and cell phone APP is a cool feature.  Often when I’m away from my computer I will open the app on my phone and assign a task to one or more of my professional assets or play a round of Sword Coast Adventures dice game to level companions.2)Graphics are decent.3)Even though you have tons of powers you are limited on how many you can have on your hotkeys which cuts down on the number of buttons you have to press in a battle.  Yes I think this is a good thing, or at least it is for me.4)The quest tracking. I like the “sparkle” trail on the ground that leads you to your quest area and back, but it can be turned off if you hate it.5)Nearly 100% voiced dialogs, including quest.6)This may not be for everyone but I like the private instanced mini dungeons you get from quest, of course you can also join up with a friend and complete them together if you wanted.7)User created content, this can be a crap shoot but there is some damn fun ones out there.The Not so Good:1)Not an open world MMO.  I know this is not a big deal but I just keep feeling like I’m missing something and I hate run into invisible walls in outdoor zones.2)No way to open the Tyrannical Lockboxchest you pick up everywhere without spending real money to buy keys.  There is nothing in them that is required to play the game and if you have enough Astral Diamonds you can often find the items from the chest in the auction house.3)Too many types of currency in the game!  Money (normal game currency), ZEN, Glory, Companion Upgrade Tokens, Astral Diamonds, Ardent Coin, Celestial Coin, and Black Ice.  That doesn’t count the other 20+ types of currency you get from quest areas, seasonal events and some chest.  I know they are doing this to make the game more detailed but I find it a pain to keep track of them all and find myself going back to old quest areas to see what I can buy with them.  At less they don’t take up bag space!4)Can be very hard to resist speeding money, for me it is mainly to gamble on those Lockboxchest, “come on, baby needs a new pair of shoes, damn snake eyes.”5)Limited bag space at lower levels.  I run out of space on almost every quest but I don’t have a full set of the biggest bags as they cost either 1,000 Zen (~$10) or 300K+ Astral Diamonds which takes a lot of time to gather.So in the end my PERSONAL OPINION is that it is a decent MMO and can be fun to play.  But will I play it for hundreds of hours? I doubt it.  I’m guessing I will finish to level 60 on my main toon and possibly test another class out but not a full level up, then move on to another game.  There are way too many FTP MMO’s out there to get stuck in one.For full disclosure:  I have spent some real money in the game to get a bigger bag and a faster mount.  But I feel I’m getting my money’s worth and I’m supporting the company as someone has to pay the developers and keep the lights on. ",1

11919,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access Reviewthis is my first review on steam. i feel the need after 6 years of being on steam to express my deepest dissapointments and frustrations with this game.Dont waste you time with this game if you are thirsty for a new MMO. Queue's to play are almost innevitable especialy if you and a group of friends started characters on the only server that was available to you during the Early Access Founders Pack Release. i gave this game more than a fair chance, i bought the deluxe which was stupid of me to do and hope this game would at leased be have legitamently playable, but it hardly is. it might say i have 22 hours of gameplay but i have 1/3 of actual play time, the rest is me sitting in a queue to play only to be disconnected after half an hour of playing to sit in THAT same queue again and again.this is the first time ive ever felt compelled to get a refund for a game ive purchased and i will admit i persued a refund after my hour played because i have seen people get a refund and have put in more time than i have in the actual game,but im not expecting it.the game is no optimized. the main city youll get max 15 FPS no matter what Graphics Card or CPU you have.the game was completly overloaded during its pre release, which is to be expected normaly but this is the 4th region that this game has been released in so they should have expected this and its ridiculous that they didnt seem to prepare for it in the slightest way possible. when i started there was 1 server for EU but they claimed there was 2. there is now 6 or 7 servers and 3 of them are full.theses are just a few issues ive experienced personaly and i could go on but i feel like other negative reviews are FAR more in depth and better explained than this.bottom line is: dont buy this game unless youve done A LOT of research before hand..",0

5553,Path of Exile,2018.0,"I have over 400 hours into this game, and while I enjoy it... I hate it at the same time. Allow me to explain:The ARPG genre is about getting lots of loot, killing lots of bad guys and feeling like your character is progressing into a powerhouse. Path of Exile is the top of the line ARPG for customization... But it's a trick.You see, as you progress in the game you don't become stronger, but rather it seems weaker. Because as you progress the game takes your defenses away from you, forcing you to stack more and more, which results in the feeling that you're fighting the developers. The game has Fire, Lightning and Cold elemental resistances, all of which have a default cap of 75% (this cap can be raised by specific pieces of gear, and very few skill tree nodes.)Now, as you progress half-way through the story, you lose 30% resists - Yes, if you have no armor on at this point, you are -30% to all of your resistances, meaning you take 30% MORE elemental damage. As you beat the campaign and begin the real endgame, you lost another 30%. Elemental Resists in this game are immensely important, and rare to find on gear - Especially Unique (Legendary) items. So to even stand a chance of not being instantly killed against the weakest of end-game enemies (not bosses, I'm talking the stuff you should at this point be 1-shotting) you need a total of 135% resists to Fire, Cold and Lightning on your gear. That isn't to fight the final boss, that's to fight the mobs that you want to farm to get the gear to fight the final content... Thus fighting the developers.The game has a massive skill tree, which looks like insane customization, but there really isn't. If you try to take a creative path and build a unique character, you MUST follow certain paths to get the defenses you need (in the form of increased Life or Energy Shield (pseudo Life)) or you will die instantly in the end-game content. This immense defensive need greatly hinders the customization the skill tree would add.I love the game's potential, but at this point, fighting the devs to even survive is mundane and quite frankily, very frustrating. If you aren't willing to dump immense amounts of time, and stress into this game, don't bother playing past the first few acts, it becomes a job as opposed to a game. I've tried to enjoy this game because I love ARPGs, but the defensive battle is simply not fun.",0

9826,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWhen this game first came out I had high hopes for it. Over the years of playing it, the game has devolved. I have played the German side from the beginning. Reto, the game devs, have made the game very unbalanced. German weaponry has gradually gotten worse and worse. To the point that the revolutionary weapon known as the Sturmgewehr (STG 44) is nothing more than an anti aircraft gun after firing 3 bullets or more. It has more kickback than a BAR. The smoke that comes out of it is immediately blinding as if the Germans only used black gunpowder. It's like throwing a smoke grenade, within 3 bullets you can't see anything. It doesn't matter because the gun is pointing at the sky after the first 3 rounds anyway. Meanwhile all allied weaponry is extremely easy to use, have very little smoke and very little kickback no matter what gun you use. One of the most ridiculous things about the game is that the allies run around with panzerfausts as if they manufactured them. The Russians have the PTRD and it will one shot any infantry, does NOT need to be fired from the prone position and will rip to shreds any and all light tanks. One of the ""features"" of this game is that you can name your guns. One of the most over powered guns of the alllies is the M1/M2. Rate of fire, ease of use, accuracy, little smoke, you name it, it has it. Common names that people I've seen with this gun are ""yes, I know it's OP"" and ""don't you wish your stg44 could be like this"" Sick of the game after many years of play. Recommend it to no one unless you like being on the unbalanced allied side and enjoy and unfair advantage.",0

12976,War Thunder,2014.0,"This is my 1.37 review.http://i.gyazo.com/cc8c867e167736659a21271ae1160e5f.pngThis is the 1.39 review.http://i.gyazo.com/5b835eaacc8e4ac4d9a5eebd0429d5d9.pngThis is the patch 1.41 review. I've spent enough time to get an idea of the new additions and new mechanics that were introduced with this patch and I'll highlight them below. First thing to note is that Patch 1.41 is not as big of a patch as 1.37 and 1.39 were. In fact it was released under a month that 1.39 was out. I'll highlight the changes below.The biggest addition of patch 1.41 was the introduction of Ground Forces into the open beta phase for everybody. While this had a lot of hype built up and player numbers rose even breaking 100k the beta only introduced two countries, Germany and Russia. These countries don't even have fully fleshed out trees which I can understand but it makes me wonder when the other nations will get their Tank trees AND have them fully fleshed out. The gameplay of Tanks is rather interesting. You have a tank, you play on different sections of familar maps given the task of eliminating other tanks, capturing objectives or defending points. Tanks is excellent with the detail that Gaijin have placed into the game. Like planes every part of a tank reacts differently to how it will perform when hit. Your ammo can cook off or your tracks can get off. You do get the option to repair mid battle which is risky but useful. Something that is annoying however is the constant artillrry spam that all players do. Some realism aspects like armor thickness and certain shells not being able to penetrate is a great addition but doesn't bode well in the term of balance. Some reserve tanks are not competitive against even Tier 2 tanks as their shells can not pierce the armour. This is ignoring some tanks which are just unspeakably broken (KV-1).For the planes we had a few additions. Germany received two new Me-262 Jets, one placed on the way to the German Sabre, and other with a 50mm cannon placed in a separate destroyer line (the Me410 with the 50mm cannons). The British received more Spitfires bringing their total in the entire tech tree to 13. The Americans received two B25 variants, one with a 75mm cannon and the other with an impressive 12 .50 cal mg's. The Russians get a Mig with cannons with a BR that guarantees low tier clubbing and the crazy brother of the I-185. The M71 Etalon.The Japanese received a cockpit for the Ki45 line. (yes, just cockpits).These aren't the only changes, there were a massive amount of BR changes and these truly go to show how much Gaijin don't pay attention. Russian and American BR's went down while Germany and Japan skyrocketed. The high tier Japanese props have a higher BR than the Yak 15 and Yak 17 Jet. Granted those Jets are awful but that doesn't fare well for the fractured Japanese community. The Me-163 jumped back up into Mig and Sabre games after the amount of crying on the forums may have deafened Gaijin while the Mig 15 and Bis for Russia went down, the cannon Sabre went down whilst the German variants remain at 8.7. The msot controversial change was the P63 going from a 5.3 to a 4.0 Seal clubbing has never been so obvious. It leads to games all over the place. There is no balance, just pilot skill used to base the BR's which is a terrible decision as countries with large player bases have lots of data whilst countries with smaller playerbases have less data. It is why Japan are soaring high. Tier 2 A6M2 against Tier 4 La7 and P51? Clearly working as intended.It's hard to give an honest opinion about what I think about this patch. Some areas could really do with a fix. Japan could do with more content. The BR system needs to be on PLANE PERFORMANCE and not player performance to ensure more balance and the Tank mechanics really give more tuning. I'll recommend the game for the addition of Ground Forces but I will not recommend Patch 1.41.",1

Let me first say that I really cared about this game a lot, I had high expectations, I had hope despite the hate before the game released. I played this game in 3 different betas, the first time being the Russian obt. I cared so much that I applied to be an emissary and was shocked when I found out I was selected. I'm sorry to anyone I convinced to buy this game, it bares on my mind at times that people have bought this game because I convinced them to, I helped this company get players into their game and con people out of their money. Lets start with the optimization, this game was never optimized it always ran horribly. They knew this for years. I like everyone else thought ""hey it's only temporary"", I've played MMO's with somewhat bad launches before with a turn around. They made a mountain of promises and never wound up delivering on any of it. They launched this game with most of its content stripped, then proceeded to act like this was new content they were releasing to try drawing peoples attention away from the fact they weren't doing♥♥♥♥♥♥about this games optimization. Initially they were at least kinda trying to fix the balancing issues with classes and plague of bugs, but looking at the update history they've given up. The reason being they conveniently announced recently that they're re-releasing this game using Unreal Engine 4 to the console market, so no they're not going to do anything about this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ They did however, say this game will be going free to play and I guarantee you they're going to make this game pay to win and try to milk every cent they can out of their shop before closing down. This game costed Neowiz so much money that I think their only goal after a while was simply to try and scam as much money as they could to recover their losses. Would not be surprised if this game ends up bankrupting them and they 100% deserve it. Do not buy this game, stay as far away from this company as possible. Valve needs to recognize this game as a scam and refund everyone who paid for it. Anyway, further, let me tell you at one point despite the optimization always being an issue, this game was way more fun a couple years ago. Originally they were kind of making a selling point that this game was supposed to have market appeal to the west. In order to do so you need to have a game that mechanically isn't another generic Korean p2w grindfest. Honestly, they succeeded at first. This game felt more similar to WoW mixed with maybe some ESO or GW2. Abilities weren't chained, you had access to them all and could mix and match, then you could choose 1 of 3 stances and that'd boost the power of abilities related to that stance. It gave you a lot of customization. What happened was people were complaining the combat was too slow. In all honesty, certain classes were a bit slow, but not all of them and the ones that were was due to the time it took to cast abilities and recovery time after casting them. All they had to do was shorten or remove the casting/recovery issues and this game would've been way faster pace. Other classes kinda had some balancing issues that needed some work. Arenas and the siege, could be queued for whenever you wanted just like WoW, you had a lot more freedom with whatever you wanted to do. So, in the Japanese beta abilities still worked the same, but instead you had this skill tree that you see in this version of the game that allows you to put points into certain abilities and it'll improve it in 1 of 2 ways. Pretty lackluster because the improvements on all abilities improve the same 2 ways. On berserker specifically it either increases the damage of the ability or increases rage generation, but it does that for every ability which is rather boring. It was clearly early testing of how they were going to change the combat to what it is and this was only a few months before NA was getting its release. When we were going to get ""overhauled combat for NA release"" to fix the pacing issues, the Japanese version of combat is what I thought we were getting. What concerned me immediately though was they were already starting to add restrictions to what you were allowed to do, arenas and the siege now had a time gate. Pretty much ruined the game for me then, but I was hopeful they'd realize it's a stupid change. Itemization works different too, but idk the specifics on it because I didn't stick around in this version long enough to find out, it was originally like I was saying before more like WoW/GW2. Balancing was nothing like this pos is, broken yes, but the combat was fine, it just needed to be cleaned up a bit.  So fast forward to release, we end up with what we see now which is beyond obvious they came to as a result of running out of both time and money so they rushed a poorly thought out combat system and resorted to turning a truly westernized Korean MMORPG into another pos Korean MMORPG, but at least Korean games are normally optimized and don't look and play like crap. It's like they last minute decided lets try to make a really bad version of Aions combat, make it grindy, and add some no fun allowed time restrictions on everything. This all happened within like a year, what a downfall. I can deal with bad optimization, I can't deal with bad mechanics and combat. Had they shipped an improved version of the Russian game I think they would've had more initial success that would've lasted a little longer...I would probably be playing it still but that's up until the point they showed what a horrible company they are and how little they truly care about this game. I was so disappointed at what we got, that the vast majority of the time you see I have played was only to login and report bugs and complaints for the CM's, I didn't even wanna be an emissary at that point and slakcked off. Maybe at some point Neowiz did care, but they just dug themselves too far into a financial pit because of the cost and how long it was taking them to finish this game. I'm truly disappointed, I really thought this game would go far, I really enjoyed it, it had huge potential, and now it's going to be a DoA title with a sullied name. I hope when this game gets canned someone out there with a soul and passion for games will buy the IP and make this game what it could've been, if it can ever have a chance again even with a new developer. RIP Bless, had I known this was gonna happen I would've played my heart out during the Russian OBT instead of waiting for NA release. Maybe one day when I finish college I can be the one to buy the IP and form my own team and revive this game, one can dream right?*This game as of now has yet to ""officially"" release and that was actually one of the reasons I defended it, but what to take away from my and other peoples posts is this companies rampart lying and over all shady practices. What you see in this games EA has changed very very little since and being so close to release is what the final product will be. When this game goes F2P and you see these reviews, know what company is running it. Don't waste your time, they're not going to fix it because their focus is on scamming a new market. Even if somehow they managed to fix a lot of it they've wronged the people interested in this game so severely that there's no recovering.",0

I long gave up on fighter combat, because I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥at air-to-air in anything and the balancing was stupid as all hell anyway, so I instead spend most of my playtime now in the mud. It sucks, because as it stands warthunder is the only non-simulator tank game that makes a tank feel like a tank (rather than the gliding-across-the-ground tanks you get in WoT and Armored Warfare), but the game is just SO so bad. The balance is terrible (How do you like facing Panzer IIIs in your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cavalry tank that's not even up-armored enough to defeat .50s?), the grind is terrible (~500RP is a decent match, and it'll be costing you tens of thousands of RP to get most vehicles), the playerbase is terrible (have fun being the only ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moving from beyond some useless camping positions!)Just don't bother. The playercount has been steadily shrinking for a while now, too, meaning the wait times between battles grow longer and longer (and Gaijin continues to do dumber and dumber things to ""fix"" that), and the quality of players grows lower and lower.",0

It's full of dumb chess pieces from different sets, like his favorite Gold Pawn. It's not really gold but he claims it is.

Combat is relatively enjoyable compared to other more popular MMOs, classes are generally fun to use and nothing is so hard to farm for that you lose all feeling in your legs for slightly darker boots.If the progress of AQW over 11 years is any sort of indication, AQ3D will be smashing WOW's♥♥♥♥♥in a couple years.9/10 would recommend",1

871,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2018.0,"I play Hearthstone, I was looking for a more balanced, less RNG based card game, this fits that role.Except that it's the most bland thing I've ever played.The reason it's balanced is because every card is so boring, they are afraid to take any chances with their design. Most of the cards I see are stuff like 3/2 ""mudcrab"" or something like that, with no text, it's boring. I've come to appreciate Hearthstone after playing this game, it may not be as balanced, or skillful, but the flavour in that game is incredible. Most cards have beautiful colourful art with fun names, and cool effects, they are willing to take risks, which is how an online card game should be handled, since they can always nerf cards. In Hearthstone you'll get a card like ""Nightmare Amalgam"", a card that is part of every tribe, meaning it's a dragon, a demon, a mech, a pirate, etc and in Legends you'll get ""Whiterun Gaurd"" a 2/3 with gaurd. Even the legendary cards in Legends are super bland compared to Hearthstone. In Hearthstone a card with just stats and no text is pack filler, in Legends that's every card.Try this game if you have time, maybe I didn't play long enough to find the few fun cards they have, but I'm not willing to spend more time in this game.",0

7786,War Thunder,2018.0,"I used to play the heck out of this game and had a ton of fun in that time, however, I cannot reccommend this game to anyone else in its current state. I stopped playing War Thunder about two months ago and since then I have had no desire to go back, the game is in a horrible cycle of bad business practices and it just isnt fun to play anymore. Gaijin is only focused on implementing more modern vehicles to the game so that people will shell out money to get said new vehicles and realize that top tier combat is horrible. Not only do they do this but they have refused to focus on releasing features that have been in the works for YEARS now (naval forces) and havent done anything to improve match making or jet combat since 2015. Right now Gaijin is only focused on milking as much cash out of their player base as possible right now which really makes me sad since this used to be my favorite game. The grind for ground vehicles is absolutely horrific, I refused to pay money and reward Gaijin for taking this route. For a little perspective on how difficult it is to get top tier tanks in this game, I have been playing for almost 1000 hours and havent gotten a single tier 6 ground vehicle.

I was sunk in the first few min of the first 3 matches. Keep in mind before using this ship I would almost always last the full match with out being sunk!. SO i put it to the test. I was last into the battle and made sure others shot first at the AI (the carrier and Battleship held back at range so they where not in the heat).

18307,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2017.0,"Firstly, I have been playing this game on and off for almost 5 years. I have spent more than 1000 hours on it and I have experienced every part of the content it has to offer. No other MMORPG had me coming back like this one did, but the fact is that the game is not so popular these days, yes, you can find lots of people to play it with, but compared to 3-4 years ago.. it is dead. I started playing again, two weeks ago, after a little break to see how the game evolved with the new content that is available right now. Endgame is really good with the new instances from Gondor, epic story is in North Ithilien, getting ready to go into Mordor which is exciting, but sadly, the game got really grindy and by grindy I do not mean grinding instances and raids which is fun, it is about gathering hundreds of flowers to exchange for armour and doing Featured Instances once per day to get recipes for essences you need to put on the slots in the armour. Daily quests exist too and they get boring after 2 weeks of doing them on a daily basis. Also, take into account that if you want to play this game to its fullest you will need to subscribe for 1 month to remove gold cap and unlock traits and bags. PVP is boring, coming from a player who is mostly looking to PVP rather than PVE. Creeps are in a good position right now and freeps just wont come to the Ettenmoors to fight, now that it is challenging. Also, everyone plays the FOTM classes which leads to the Moors being stacked with 30 creeps while the freeps are on the stairs of GV afking. As someone who plays this game, I surely recommend it to you because it has one of the best communities in the gaming world, everyone is nice and will help you.

There is only 1 solution I found on my problem but still this issue is frustrating since when I got it to work it starts downloading patch at around 6:30 when servers are up... Then I get to load the game and create character then another frustrating thing is the server queue. It takes a long time to get into the game , for me it took about an hour just to finish the queue.

Combat is enjoyable and if the teams are balance can be quite awesome along side this games visuals. My only complaints is not how long the loading screens are but rather how many there are and find this slightly annoying. Next complaint would match making and long wait times, but this is due because of the small community and probably the wide variety of skill and the only way to fix this issued is either make the games shorter(which please do not due that spoils some of the fun in this game) or get a bigger community which isn't easy. Although there is a wasy for you to help this! Play more! More people playing more in the pool lesser wait times!",1

And the game looks pretty much like a 10 year old game then. At that point it started crashing and i'm not really willing to put effort into fixing lag in a crappy asia weeb game. Not worth the time it takes to download even if it's free. Worst performance i've seen so far and i played The Secret World until it's untimely demise. Even worse performance than the abomination Secret World Light that came after that. So basically it's unplayable. I don't think the best system on the planet could make that game run smooth.",0

The game has its flaws, such as very bad pacing for the spoilers for the next set, and really corny and inconsistent lore. However, the core card-game gameplay is a lot of fun, and the game is extremely well-balanced in ranked mode and also has a very fun draft mode, both of which shower you in rewards (roughly a pack per day if you reroll quests, and each pack has like 10 cards).

I played it all through the beta with a lot of my friends. The game is not deep, but it's not trying to be. It's meant to be a grindfest. It's meant to be casual fun with friends. The combat is pretty good. The building is not great, but it's decent. There's a lot to do in Trove, but it does all sort of feel empty because, at the end of the day, it is a sugar rush.I'm bored of it now, but I can't very well give it a thumbs down after enjoying it for a solid 300 hours. The game is not perfect, but I think it's a safe recommendation to anyone who is interested in a casual and grindy MMO with block building.",1

11450,Freestyle 2: Street Basketball,2016.0,"Waste of time. Ignore the fact that the initial loading screen takes 5-10 minutes for God knows why. Ignore the fact that the UI is dog vomit. Ignore the usual P2W tropes, because they are all here and there is nothing to be said for it that hasn't already been said a thousand times for P2P games.I understand this is ""street ball"" as the term is used by the community as an excuse for how terrible competitive play is. The actual gameplay still doesn't make sense. 3 Point shots are made 90% of the time regardless of how much Defense is on the shooter, so the entire community just dribbles for 20 minutes and chucks up the ball from behind the perimeter and it just goes in inexplicably. Defense is TRASH on this game. Most of the blocks in this game are goal tends, meaning the person can just swat the ball way after its already coming down towards the goal. You can do this thing where you try to square up to your openent with your arms out, but that does jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the offensive dribble animations are so jerky and sudden they will always have space to chuck up a shot with 90% chance of it falling. There is absolutely NO reason to put attribute points into any defensive stat. I'm harping on defense because if the game had it, it would potentially be competitive. But it's just, ""Let me arbitrarily move around near my opponent and hope the tilted RNG will let their ugly randomly thrown shot that im contesting miss."" I've watched games where everyone is pro-level and it's still the same. do ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dribble animation and toss ball from 3 point line.Calling it Streetball isn't an excuse to have severely unbalanced gameplay. P.S Community actually gets upset at you if you don't just chuck up 3's the entire time as a SG. You arent allowed to drive or take an open 2. Even if you make it, You get called a ""Bad SG"". Even if you get an offensive rebound near the rim they expect you to dribble back out over the perimeter to chuck a 3. Why are we even allowed to put points in other attribute categories, then? ♥♥♥♥ it, uninstalled.""Steph Curry: The Game"" gets a 2/10 from me. ",0

9226,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"After playing this game a while I can confidently say this isn't a good game.It has some issues with being buggy, being swarmed by gold sellers and such, which can be ignored to some extend. But when gold sellers start to lag your gameplay by spamming, I would have imagined it would be fixed in a month. Haven't noticed any difference in attempt to fix it.Class system is certainly interesting. It's also major pain in the butt as it's confusing beyond belief. If you happen to make bad pick with class (which is really easy to do, if you haven't studied all the variances) you might not notice it before going a lot further in game. Also not to mention picking wrong class will mean you have to reroll the character as this game is redundantly harsh with picking your route. Picked wrong stat for your build? Too bad, you are out of luck with this game.As a korean game, it's mindless grindfest. In itself it isn't a problem, but without good dungeon/raids party system and so on it grows old really quick. I have understood this should be spiritual successor to Ragnarok online, but it seems to miss so many things that made RO good. There isn't same sense of adventure, the same quality of mob design, the same unique sound world. It might be because of nostalgia, but having been playing RO quite frequently, I certainly feel more like playing that than this. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. There is better grindfests out there.It's hard to think of good qualities to say when bad sides are so numerous.",0

I don't understand why it was so necessary to print such a large amount of cards in a short period of time, instead of allocating more time for balancing certain cards (yes, they balancing a few cards that affect meta in a few months after expansion...and even with those 'right nerfs' i want to choke myself sometimes, still remember nerf of Piercing rune instead of Levi or Daria; nerf of Catacomb Prince instead of Eachtar. And know what? You will never see the nerfs of legendary cards like in old times i guess, what about current expansion...pray guys, maybe they will nerf Spawn of Abyss, but i don't think so, maybe they rework Baphomet..this is right but not that powercreep, first was aegis and now this one...I don't even want to talk about Grimnir...).With each expansion the game is getting worse, for some strange reason with the addition of new cards, the pool of playable decks is getting smaller, although it should be the vice versa, right?The golden time of 'Darkness Evolve' has passed and for some reason i remember it as real 'Wonderland Dream'. Those flashbacks with Fighter and Goliath cards...Seems like they trying to kill the game as i see. The people seems like lost their mind and doesn't care about fun in this game anymore. Even unranked is full of same cancer/net decks... This is not the 'testing place' as it was before in old time, truly sad.Wanted to post review in RoB expansion , where all the mess began, but closed my eyes on those mistakes made by developers one time, forgiven again in TotG, but not now, enough guys , this is cry of my soul already, i can't handle this anymore.",0

Could be fun if the game design is not all about money... I sum up : money could be spend to have some game coins, and this coins could be used to buy some weapons or other good stuff. When you begin the game, you think that it's possible to play the game without spending any money. But it's not. If you don't buy, you can't defeat powerfull monster ! And the only weapons you could find on the game for free are bad compared to them ! So, after the level max (20), you die, you don't have a choice... yeah, die again and again and being stuck quikly without seing a lot of the fun of RotMD, or pay and play the real game.A false free game !

17083,Tactical Monsters Rumble Arena,2018.0,"My first impression was that this is a nice game, after around 15-16 hours my view was that this is nice yet there is a pay block to it. I'm about 2-3 weeks into the game and completely stopped playing it by now. it's not even p2w. it's more like pay to play. I'll explain: since the play time is very limited and there is not a lot of things to do after you do the adventure mode(at least as far as you can go) you are limited to a few rumbles a day. these never change and the progress is very very slow. it makes this play time feels more like a chore or an assignment rather than an actual game. So in a little while you just don't feel like doing it anymore. the sad thing is that even if you invest money into it, it wouldn't change anything. you'll still end up doing daily chores, nothing more. you can't farm anything. you have limited rumbles and limited guerrilla warfare and that's it. if you're going for a boring weekend you can download it, after that you can delete it again. otherwise I wouldn't recommend playing it. I don't mind paying for a game I can farm items or cards in. in this game the farm is the payment. that's it. after that you're stuck until you pay again but nothing will change anyway, you'll still do the same limited things everyday. Even donation(a mechanic in which you donate cards you don't need for points to replace cards you do need) is not rewarding enough. the ratio is about 1 to 4 and only applies to lower rank monsters. the high good ones will require you to either get really lucky or invest a lot of money(and then get lucky too) so why bother. find another game",0
10739,Fractured Space,2017.0,"I'm pretty new to the game but i just had to make a review , thing that i rarely do.First i want to talk about the community , in my many years of playing video games i had rarely encountered such a friendly and welcoming community , they embraced me from the beginning and they were really cool when we lost games because of my noobness ( which was quite often ) . The devs work pretty close to the community , most of them are big fans of their own game , you will play with them quite often , if you wanna team up or you have any questions  just join the official discord.The game is pretty cool too , beautiful ships , beautiful enviroment , and plenty of pew pew and explosions . You can get all the ships in the game quite fast just by playing the game , no hidden stops or sneaky micro transactions , you can get anything in the game with credits except the skins , which still have a chance to drop from cargo boxes ( i got 2 ). This is the purest form of free to play that i have ever seen in a game , especially in a moba. This game is awesome , not perfect , don't get me wrong . it still has some issues and it can be rough around the edges sometimes , but you won't even notice it , the community is awesome like i said but i still had 1 or 2 bad encounters , morons are everywhere and you can't really avoid it , but i used that lovely red report button. It's a game you should really try , nothing to lose only to gain.Sorry for the horrible formatting and the huge block of text :D .",1

1270,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"When I heard Bethesda was making a card game in the likes of hearthstone I got very excited. I really enjoy the Elderscrolls franchise and I also enjoy card games of the likes of Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. I have been playing Hearthstone for quite a while and I have gotten a bit weared down by the sheer luck it takes to play the game and the  new expansion with the quest mechanic that turned me off a lot. Any ways, I am happy to say the Elder Scrolls legends is great and a worthy competetor in the card game genere. I like the rune mechanic with drawing cards as you take damage so you never feel as though you are running dry on cards. I also enjoy the profecy mechanic which is bassically the equivalent to a Magic The Gathering Instant. The only problem I have with the game is with the card presentation but I am sure It will be fixed down the road. If you are on the lookout for a quick card game to pick up I can, without a doubt, suggest this game.",1

5314,Creativerse,2017.0,"Been playing this game for a few good hours trying to unlock every recipe and build cool stuff, after unlocking everything and hit the wall of premium that has no use in thig game everything started to feel like dead and out of interest.The game feels like a copy out of minecraft with a nice resourcepack and with sofisticated/complex crafting that gives this game a big plus, at the same time a minus also if you really want to create things making you miss the ""creative mode"" from minecraft.The creatures in the game are to damn easy to kill and feel lifeles compared to minecraft, they tend to bug making them easyer to kill, run in circles around them while slashing.I loved the idea of portals, wow that was cool feature giving a different angle to adventure,The hand that sucks everything out of anything it was better then the medieval pickaxe/shovel/axe/hands,I would probably had more to say but its late and lost my ideas, but i will say this: This game its just an improvement of minecraft, that doesnt mean it has anything to do with it, while it has many bugs and exploits available the game is fun but due to its complex nature it makes it  abit boring after a while especially when you want to do it in scale, but thank you ""extractors/bombs/excavators"" now we only need ""x-ray""(not really). But after you unlocked and did everything the game feels like finishing a game in story mode and thats it compared to minecraft where even if it get boring at least you can find something to do(but this is just my opinion), the mechanical part and decoration keeps you up to the task.To bad you cant find servers with more then 5 players making the game more for friends/groups/etc rather then for a new comer ,THe end, i wouldve said more but as i mentioned before lost my ideas, plus i am not good with ""writing"" reveiew , rather discuss them.",1
6948,Creativerse,2017.0,"In short: It's great. It's free. Bought content is really not necessary. Bought content isn't very expensive anyway. Very easy multiplayer. Lots of stuff to build with and also wiring systems (yes, also free). No mods so far, but enough content itself. Buy the stuff, support the devs.Long version:I gotta say I'm not a Minecraft enthusiast. I mean, it was first. And my son played it a lot. And I played it too, and it's awesome in its way and it's kind of the game I wanted when I was younger, but so is Creativerse. First things first, also because I noticed that it's the highlight of most negative reviews: Is this pay to win? No. If you buy the pro version you get some wings, a flashlight more customization options for your world and you can have multiple worlds. Among other things. BUT you won't receive any better weapons or superior blueprints or whatever... Pro gives you stuff, but nothing mandatory.Same goes for the other stuff you can buy. Yeah, if you want some fancy medieval things you gotta invest about 10€ to buy 1000 coins and the medieval castle bundle, BUT you can go with the vanilla craftable furniture and so on as well. There's enough to choose from. Want fancy stained glass blocks? That's some 3€ or so... Developers need money to develop, and this game gives you all of the content for free and makes you pay very fair prices for extras.Creativerse makes a pretty young impression and there are a few obvious glitches, but nothing serious. The game doesn't take you by the hand, but most things are pretty intuitive. And if they're not, you are being told how stuff works. Multiplayer works flawlessly so far, you can also teleport to specific player's teleportstones which makes it easier to join up. Apart from the usual building-with-blocks things there's also some tech stuff and a device which enables you to easily wire switches with doors and other things, also with logic gates inbetween. It's really just connecting dots and feels a bit like the same feature for the DOOM snapmap editor. The game looks and feels good so far and apart from crashing two times (without any progress lost by the way), it runs smoothly. I'm not sure about the biomes. There are lots of those, but I'd love to see more and bigger ones. But anyway, I liked those I saw, also the deep and pretty dangerous caves.Not sure if a minecraft fanboy/-girl would like Creativerse (or any other block based game that is not Minecraft), but I like it very much and even bought the pro version, though not only for the benefits, but also because l like to support the developers. I'd love to see this game ripe and grow adult. Downside: no mods (so far).",1

1599,Champions Online,2014.0,"This is the game that every superhero fan should at least try out once. The powers and appearance customization are the best I've ever seen in any game ever with the exception of mods.You can set your appearance in a number of ways, colors and styles. Even without access to the premium costumes (wich are often not that better from the default ones) you have hundreds of thousands of combinations.Sadly you need the gold account to access the powers customizations, but the default archetypes are enough to have fun in almost any hero style you like. Also now they have Freeform character slots, so if you feel like spending money you can do it only once to have access to the powers customization once available only to gold members.The game story progress as you level and it's interesting and captivating. You start fighting back alley muggers and street gangs and fight your way to saving the world from abismal interdimensional forces and mad scientists in lost islands. After you reach lvl 50 you can even design your own arch nemesis and he will come pound down on you when you least expect it, and it doesn't deviate from the setting a bit.

1287,Creativerse,2017.0,"In short: A good sandbox game with a welcoming community. A bit less short: While it gets compared to Minecraft quite a bit, I think it does enough to establish itself as something different and not just a clone. The devs are a fairly active part of the community which can be seen by reviewing the games forums. Additionally, they release fairly regular updates containing new features, improvements, and new blocks to build with. Ultimately, this is a fun game to play solo and a great game to play with others.About Free-to-Play: I'm typically skeptical of free to play games, but feel the monetization in this one is prety fair. As of this review: Revenue is based on the sale of Pro DLC, Welcome Bundle DLC, and 'Coins'. Coins are used to purchase from the in-game shop and items for sale include block recipe sets (learn once, use on any 'world'), convenience items (extractors, dynamite, etc) that can otherwise be crafted in game, and (new-ish) costumes.",1

YOU CAN MAKE IT!The raw customization this game gives you for free outshines most other games that make you pay for customization. Sure, it has quite a few options that require paying Zen, but it also has a (though slow to aquire) way to earn Zen just by playing the game. Questionite (one of the currencies) can be sold for Zen, and that can be used to buy anything from the cash store. Yeah, I did say it was slow, but another option is buying items with in game resources from the auction house. Almost anything that is tradable can be purchased there.Also, if you don't like the comic style outline, you can turn it off and have it look more like the other two superhero games and still have the extra customization this one affords you!",1

The fun in the game had long been sucked dry by people who throw hissy fits if they don't get the most kills or if they're paired with people who are still trying to learn the game. I was never that great at the game, and found that I really wasn't able to improve when no one wanted to play with a noob. And with that, I left. When I heard about Smite in early 2015 from Jontron, I was eager to give mobas a second chance. I loved playing the game and found myself a welcome member of the community.

You can mix colors like you do in Magic but you only get 2 color and what i think is ""artifact"" card system like they have in Magic.  there are daily quest to get ""coins"".  So far i would say you can easily play this game without paying, although if you want to drop a few buck you can save yourself some time.Small Recap:  The makes of this game did do justice to the game.  the art is good, animations are statisfactory, voice acting good, equal balance between hand holding and letting you think for youself.

9010,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is an early access game that in my opinion is in a very good state, here are some bugs but that's understandable.Notice that this is not a traditional Battle Royal game: there are up to 4 winners in this game. Also it happens in a snowy environment and has three player classes which makes a nice combination of features in the game. Recently the developers added a season pass ($10) which, as usual in this kind of games, provides cosmetic changes.There's FortNite (which is more comics like), there Player Unknown battleGrounds (which is more realistic, plus was the pioneer), there was Islands of Nyne (which died because of being a complex game plus competition against the 80 tons FortNite mamooth), and there's Ring of Elysyum which .... in my opinion is a very nice game, well built.Also, developers are really paying attention to their officel reddit forums. That doesn't means they do everything people ask just that they pay attention to players.",1

15503,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"I can't tell you how many times I've died in this game and felt not a thimble of anger- there is a realism to this game in the sense that you are one soldier of many... MANY others that are waging firefights spread out over a ginormous map. There is nothing binding you anywhere other than loyalty to your cause and a will to do what you need to for your faction to secure the target or defend it. The openness of being a soldier without orders is very liberating, and the albeit insanely steep learning curve for accurate shooting and vehicle use leads to immense satisfaction when scoring a kill or just surviving a battle. I suggest you play this with a group of friends in the same faction- build a squad and use your teamwork as an advantage in battle. Most other players are lone wolves and can either be picked off when not in a pack or simply outgunned if you walk a tight-knitted squad down the streets with somebody covering every angle and teamspeak running so you know exacly what's going on. Overall a great game, I consider it a benchmark F2P.",1

You may say: The skills matter not the tools, but in this games it ain't so. From where do I know this. A friend of mine has payed something like 25 EUROS for the mobile alternative and well believe me or not, he reached the higher areas for some days.I got this one for free and well I personally didn't enjoyed it.

18781,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewTo anyone considering this game, sorry but you missed the window of when it was good.  Ultimately the point of a game is to have fun and right now it is not fun.  It used to be fun to build, fun to play, even sometimes fun to lose.  However the last half year have been stripping this away, and now after the past couple of months it is no longer fun even to win a game.  When winning, losing, and building are all a chore and not fun, it is a sign that the game has failed in the very mission.I have been playing this game for over 1000 hours counting the stand alone launcher.  I started back when it first went on steam, and although I wish I could give it a good review, at this point I simply can't.The Developers had a fantastic game, that needed a few tweaks, a little balancing, and some bug fixes but was otherwise really good.  Then starting around November 2015 they began doing major updates that completely broke multiple aspects of the game.  These updates came about more and more often.  Worst of all they completely changed the direction that the game had been going.Thus veterans such as myself who fell in love with game X and were excitedly waiting its finished product, instead now have Game Y and dread its completion.I tried to keep playing, but they just keep making it more difficult to stick with it.  Everything feels gimmicky and very much like a smartphone app game.  Balance is worse than ever, and long time elements of the game were broken.  Ultimately it feels like the game is intending to drive away veteran players in favor of casuals.Very sad to say, but at this point I shall no longer be playing, except to test periodically and see if the game has been fixed to the greatness where it once was.  Barring that I just can't seem to bring myself to even finish a round.",0

20346,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFrom the perspective of someone that has played the game on every server so far, including the rebuild servers as well, so yes there is bias. Yes there will be blind fanboyism. But I will do what I can to keep this as transparent as possible.Yes, I am 100% aware we received a client that still had dupes, bugs, and glitches from a previous version and I can not let that slide past the review that they blatantly didn't care enough to fix that BEFORE launch. Do I know why? No. And neither do you honestly so stop creating the idea of ""LAZY COMPANY. WANTS GAME TO FAIL"". They spent over a literal ♥♥♥♥ton of money to port the game over to the Western servers and they are not going to sit by and let the game crash, or at least if they are smart they wouldn't haha. The game had launch problems... What game hasn't? More closely, what MMORPG hasn't? Especially KMMORPGs. Hell we can look at American made games too, it isn't just the Asian MMORPG market. You know that really big MMORPG that everyone is hoping the ""next MMORPG"" kills. That WoW game that every MMORPG is compared to. I know a lot of you are probably too young or just didn't play computer games then. But that launch? MUCH worse than this game. Hell we can come to a more recent date even. Anyone play WoW WoD launch? The servers were down for a week for their more populated servers, so educate yourself before saying the server stability for this launch was bad. That can be drawn to many reasons but people aren't arguing the reason. They are only arguing that it happened. This is one of the smoother launches for MMORPGs that I've every experienced. Now could it have been smoother? Yes. They ♥♥♥♥ed up thinking that their servers could hold THAT many people all logging in at the same exact time into the game. They should have started with 5+ servers and then cut them down as time went on or something along those lines to make it smoother and keep a ""nicer"" image of their company. But they didn't and it made them look lazy and stupid. I won't back them up or say people are wrong, the servers were♥♥♥♥♥♥the first 2-3 days but they have fixed a lot of the issues revolving around with not being able to even play the game, so just give it time as far as optimization is concerned. If that's why you left and refunded or if that's what is keeping you from getting the game then don't get the game. Wait. If you really want to play it but are scared of that, just keep up to date with the game. Stay active in the reddit, read reviews. Formulate your own opinion based on the game from the reviews. See if the negatives outweigh the positives you're concerned about.Now to the point of making your own opinion. There have been a lot of videos from youtube content creators constantly bashing and destroying everything about this game, names like Cryy, lolhero, LazyPeon, Gaming Lighthouse and many more I'm sure. They are given the right to feel how they want about the game and for the most part, every point that each of these videos made was 100% accurate, I won't discredit them. They got to where they are now for being pretty transparent, but just remember. They aren't you. Yes this game has flaws, and yes it has too many issues that we should not be okay with in 2018. But look through all of the information presented to you, don't copy opinions based on what one person you've watched for years says. My friends (that have never played the game before, all from WoW) all got the game early access. They saw those videos and guess what. They still play the game, because while those videos had a lot of truth behind them, my friends still enjoy the game. Yes it has flaws. But it can still be enjoyable if you focus on having fun and not on attacking every negativity. Now maybe you do that and still don't like the game. Then walk away, refund it and you're good. Don't come back, don't constantly keep going back to♥♥♥♥♥♥talk the people that ARE enjoying the game. You only make yourself look like an♥♥♥♥♥ even if you feel the need to voice your opinion, it really isn't needed. Be happy with your money back and enjoy life, don't stress over a game you already quit. Lol.Apart from the rant, obviously there is still blind fanboyism and with reason. I absolutely enjoy playing this game. The leveling is fun to me and has been on every re-iteration of the game. The taming system is addicting. The crafting system is an easy but fun grind. Gathering to max level gathering is addicting. I actually feel like I'm going somewhere everytime I get a drop unlike BDO. I played BDO for a significant amount of time and yes getting that one boss drop was exciting. But short lived excitement... I never felt stronger until I spent 2 months grinding the item out to TRI. This game has a different gear system so it isn't a fair comparison, I'm more comparing the feeling of gearing, I actually feel like I'm getting stronger everytime I get a drop. Going form green to blue. From one blue drop to the next always makes me feel like I'm progressing and I'm not even +ing the gear yet. TL;DR .... Yes the game has flaws but it can still be fun. Give it time to get better or play now. Your decision. I love the game and I'm going to continue to play it. :D ",1

This is just anotherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥polished ""Alpha"" scheme designed to take your money and provide no effort on making it a better game. They just release another sub-portion of the game which they will make you pay for if you want to try it. The streamers of this game are in a constant rage fueled hatred for the game mechanics and publically trash this hogwash of a game daily. The American servers are full of racist, triggerbotters, and Chinese.... If you expect to be able to get flawless shots that will never happen.... If you expect the hitboxes for the Chinese players (half the lobbies you'll join) to be the same as the American players well thats not going to happen.... Imagine trying to slingshot a headless chicken running through a barn. This is 2017 and the game industry is booming, but these people at Daybreak do not give two flying f's about you or their game.

3634,Brawlhalla,2018.0,"There's two kinds of people that write negative reviews on this game:1. People who either have bad internet connection or are unlucky enough to be located near the edge of the world (far from servers)2. Players who can't accept the fact that they are being smashed by lowly spammers and they ramble on about how unfair the game is (it wouldn't be if you got good)There are a few reasons why I would recommend this game. One of which is that you can find really amazing individuals walking around in all game modes (FFA has a significant lack of them, but they can rarely still be seen there). I feel like hitboxes in this game are really fair. You will sometimes get hit by something you wouldn't expect, but you could've known it has a weird hitbox and could've played around it.Whenever something bad happens to you, you could've done something better. Every mistake is a learning ground and one that you created yourself. And this is true also for real life.Have a nice life and hopefully a nice experience with this game. ^^",1
1216,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewTrash. It's a MTG clone made worse with a 75 card deck minimum. Oh, they also managed to make it look like Hearthstone. They like to boast that it was designed by MTG pros. Which is funny, because it's almost cut and paste from MTG mechanics. So yeah, great job pros. They managed to steal the resource system from Hex though, so at least they shopped around.The only reason this game has positive reviews is because of the F2P system. Everyone loves free @#$% right? Quality isn't an issue then. If you want a better game with a fair F2P model that actually takes some skill (unlike this screw/flood garbage game) go spend your time with Faeria. If you want quick matches and a fair F2p system try Shadowverse. If you want to waste your time with a game that amounts to tossing a coin to see if you win or lose (screw/flood) play this.If you want to play MTG, don't bother with cheap imitations like this.Edit: Recently the Devs went to the subreddit to whine above negative reviews and begged everyone there to post positive reviews on the game.

8957,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewTLDR; Check back in a month. Loot system doesn't reward. Game is ludicrously grindy.Played since release (pre-steam). Game was always grindy. But now it's worst than a Korean MMORPG. You get these crates, which contain from 1 to 4 items depending on the mode you played. If you're premium, you get twice an many items. Items now have a rarity, with the coolest being legendary, and the essentials being white/rare/epic.The concept is cool, but the items you get are essentially garbage. Let's say you have premium, and you open a Protonium crate you earned from acheveing top place in Battle Arena (which is like 30 minutes). A sample crate would be (after the ""fix"" patch), 7 green items and 1 blue item. Doesn't sound bad right? A♥♥♥♥♥♥hover, 20x triangle cubes, 20x window cubes (thats your rare), a single wheel, 20x corner cubes, a bottom left corner ""mask"" cosmetic, the flag of poland, and a♥♥♥♥♥♥rudder.As a new player, you can't make much out of that. You can upgrade your existing robot, but only to a certain point. As a played with an OK stock of basic items and a working robot (my situation), you can't do anything with that. And as a veterant player, it's all garbage.Problem is the distribution of items in the top tier crate, Protonium, is something like 10% white, 60% green, 20% rare/blue, 10% epic, 0% legendary.And amongst the item pool are ""cosmetic"" items. Masks, window blocks, flags.And you only get 1 item of each. Except cubes, you get 20 of those.So unless your idea of a robot is a handful of blocks with a wheel, a hover and a thruster, and a single gun, this game will make you work very hard to get a working ""set"" of items. Even more so if you want to upgrade from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tier.It's just not fun, the rewards aren't rewarding and they aren't coherent. There is this recycle/forge system, but right now you get 20% of the value of the item. So if you take all the items from that Protonium crate, you can melt them down and craft 1 or 2♥♥♥♥♥♥tier SMGs (you need like 9 to be effective). At 400 ""robits"" each. Let's say you want to craft that Flak cannon that guy blew you up with over and over in the last match. 75000 robits. That shotgun-like thing that other guy blew half you bot off in one hit with. 122500 robits. Thats a lot of crates. Like 300. 300 premium, top-place victories in Battle Arena, the longest match mode. If you lose you get the Bronze crate regardless of your performance.A positive point in all this, is that the crate tiers seem to not matter! So you can just practically idle, lose the game, and get your 8-item Bronze crate, and progress as fast as that other guy with his carefully crafted bot and hard earned victory that's getting Protonium crates.Check back in a month.",0

I have invested some money because I want to support the developer, but by most any metric Eternal is the most free to play card game out there. - Free PvE with decent rewards - Interesting mechanics and not too much randomness, many viable decksAll together, the strategy is deep and the games are a blast.

I usually set up fleets for specific roles.Like space, there are multiple planets that revolve around their stars as well as systems and sectors, so you can really go out to battle across sector and planetary space! See a player traveling through space? Attack it :)There are micro transactions but even those don't really help you much since upgrading things once you are about level 18 take a lot more ""gold"" to instantly upgrade. So my take on this is to upgrade and just go on to raid lower lvl AI fleets.Everything is in real-time so you may be battling a fleet here but another player is attacking your unguarded base.",1

There are a lot of complaints that it is pay to win, which in my experience is wrong, I haven't spent a cent on this game and have beat the campaign and a ton of online players. I use the Alduin's Apocalypse deck I bought for in game currency, I made in about an hour, after beating the main story and a few mini rewards quests. A lot of complaints are that the game is too hard and they can't advance fast enough, but that's only due to the players skill level.

Sure, it's not the samething but there's progression - leaderboards to fight over if that's your thing. The game doesn't take itself seriously; I enjoy that aspect and I hate it at the sametime. I appreciate a game that can look at itself and give the finger on a few things but a lot of players look towards games with a clean shave and haircut. Why else invest time in a game that doesn't take itself seriously? Could mean a short life span and not worth the time (looking at the number 3 in the title). I think treating it as goofy as they make it be is our best bet and maybe soon enough we'll get that clean barber shaved poker game sometime later on. This will do for now.Still good as hell, just play it.",1

20241,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,"This is review on this really nice game. Now.. where do I start.. Alright, this game is about Tanks (obviously) and is highly recommended to people who are into tanks, or just like competitive games. I absolutely adore this game for numerous of reasons, one of them is how simple and great this game is. You just set your region, log in (through steam preferably), do the tutorial and after just enjoy the battles as you slowly progress and upgrade your tank. This game is really nice visually, and it ALSO supports really low Specs such as my laptop's! Here are the proper cons and pros to avoid confusion:Pros:-Really simple and fun-Supports nearly any system-Its settings allow you to run it on a potato-Good competitive gameCons:-Mostly the community, I've met a bit of ragers and children, but only a bit-A bit difficult to start with a weak tank compared to all the strong ones.That's basically all pros I could find.

19186,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewDear Freejam.Robocraft Was a Great Enjoyable Game. something great to come back to after a long, tiring day, to let loose. Yet then that all changed.The Epic loot update, unlike it names sugests, made it the worse game known to man, within a couple of hours.It made me cry, for a few hours, to see my what was favorite game become this inslut. In the time i have layed down this game, to presure my other dreams and try out the other games that have been collecting dust due to my love for this game and when i picked it up again. It Became terible. The Epic loot update, Which happened in my absense unlike it names sugests, made it the worse game known to man, within a couple of hours.It made me cry, for a few hours, to see my what was favorite game become this inslut. The old Robo-Ranking or even messed up tier matching system, was better than this junk. Now they use cpu for matching. This is the main reason it sucks, robocraft wouldn't be this bad and this could of been a posstive rating if this wasn't a mechinic.Now the removal of the tech tree was too, a terrible idea.  this allowed Op things to exsist in lower matches which is another reason this game now sucks.they also changed the loot system, and the ecomny. By this i mean they Set EVERYONES BALNCE TO ZERO. geting rid of all the hard work grinding RP. Thanks! RP used to be the reward for playing matches. they changed this to crates. which depending on how good they were. Even from the best one you rarely get anything good.When i looked at these mechinics, i noticed something, These mechinics did not allow Free to Play to be fun at all.However, They made Pay to Play Awesome.You could get anything you wanted not only because everything is exepseive, but also the removal of the tech treePreuim also got 2x the amount of stuff from crates, Xp, and 2 more paltoon spots.I miss the old robotcraft, with RP, GC, Tech Tokens, without the overpowered almost unachiveble cubes. But the thing i miss the most was how fun it was. Back when they had good ideas for updates. I miss when there were tiers.Please for the Love of god, fix your game Freejam.

13816,DCS World Steam Edition,2014.0,"I'll narrow this down to the good and the bad points about this game. (Updated 10/13/2015, shortly after graphics overhaul. [NOTE!] So far these upgrades are not shown in the above screenshots)The Good:-A large array of aircraft to fly(if you buy the moduls). Many of which are fully interactive, as in almost every switch and button can be flipped with the click of your mouse(you can rebind the keys as you see fit). The rest of the aircraft are more like simplifed simulations, not fully interactive but easier to learn. As far as I know, they handle realisticly.-Amazing graphics post update! The lighting, weather, and smoke effects are absurdly good, the ground now uses a bump map, meaning flat textures on the ground cast shadows, it really makes the terrain look a million times better. Basically it just looks better and even runs better.-Detailed single player campaigns for each and every aircraft, some single player campaigns very in their difficulty and legnth. For example, the A-10A's campaign features smaller scale misisons that don't require much time to complete. Where as the SU-25's campaign features much larger scale misisons that take much longer to complete(imagine after taking off from your airfield, you must fly for 20-30 minutes to the combat zone, then fly back to land when your mission is complete, Which I guess is more realistic).-Quick misson generators which allow you to practice with your aircarft before doing the campaigns.-One thing I really like is that you can choose your payload, each aircraft has a large variety of weaponry, and it is fun carefully choosing your payload according your mission objective. Variety is such a great thing, and variety is something this game has in large quantities.-The game is very well optimized now, it used to run like garbage even with incredeble hardware, but even after the graphics overhaul, the game runs a lot more smoothly than it did.-The load times have been vastly improved, it used to take 5 minutes to load anything up in this game, now its about 30 seconds to a minute to load. Any subsequent load time is around 15 seconds.Bare in mind my hardware specs are as follows:AMD 8-core 4.0 GHZR9 290 with 4GB of VRAM GDDR512GB 1600MHZ of RAMThe Bad:-expect a minor frame rate dips if our have mirrors and ground clutter active.-The game's training is hit or miss. The SU-25T(which you get for free) has training missions that are interactive. Then you have most of the Flaming cliffs 3 aircraft which have shoddy low res videos, that is out of sync with the sound and voice that is explaining everything. For the Mi-8, the game will only teach you how to turn it on, take off, and how to use the weapons, but it only tells you how to use the rockets, and 2 of the 3 types of gun pods, and doesn't teach you how to use bombs. Worst of all, it did not teach me how to land with the helicopter, which is harder than you may think. I crashed 40 times trying to figure out how to land properly. The game has a steep learning curve, and the training videos just makes an already hard to learn game even more inaccessible.-I find that the default controles are confusing and clunky. I basically had to completely setup and rebind the contols to something more comfortable. This took a lot of time, learning what each function did, then figuring out what my new layout should be. But when your done, your done and can enjoy the game. Keep in mind, you have to completely set up your controles for each indavidual vehicle!In conclusion:If I can add anything more to the review, I will. But overall, the game is great, and I highly reccomend it if you like flight simulators.",1

15862,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2016.0,"Note that this really is not a free to play simulation. The free content is no good.

Then this is your sim. It is hands down the best simulation of actual RACING ever made and with the recent updates it is very close to life like racing. Now that adaptive ai is working it is also the best simulation for single player. The fact that physics are developed in unison with the real DTM/TT drivers (whom you also see sometimes online) as well as the general engine being awesome makes this the best package right now if you have all prerequisites.

Apparently the plan is that once the British are added they will be at war with the Germans the Rusians AND the USA) The devs can be slow to revert to ""better systems"" after getting feedback.

Well.. It really is, in my opinion the best moba I've played.. As long as you're not trying to go into the deep, dark corners of what this game has to offer, in which case I won't recommend playing Smite.The game itself is very good, offering a wide variety of forms of entertainment for the player.One could argue locking certain skills behind a paywall is not a good thing to do, but let's remember skins are not what's crucial in a moba. What is crucial in a moba is a decent community, which since Smite's release on Steam, the game is lacking.Not counting the joke of an attempt to balance characters and items, Smite's toxic community is its great downfall.Steam's player base, flooding Smite since it's release on this platform is, in my opinion the factor that genuinely  ruined the game.You'll be forever stuck playing with either bad-mouthing or poorly performing teammates, this meaning that you'll have to use the most over powered character if you'd want the slighest chance to win a game, which is not a fun experience for neither you or the players you'll be fighting againstSmite's Ranked Games are unplayable unless you team up with people you know are performing well and/or respecting others as individuals, not feeling the  urge to use bad manners.Smite was fun. It really was, but we killed it.",0
1062,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"Note this review is very strict :P .Planetside 2 reviewI USED to like the game , now I dont. I stopped playing about 3 months since March 2014 and came back during the Hossin Continent update, in hopes of a more fun and balanced gameplay. But it dissapointed me on so many levels. I was rusty when I came back but none the less I still remember the core mechanics and how to point and shoot. I played a few hours and died a lot, but its was to be expected after 3 months of leaving the game. About 15 hours in and not only my PPH (points per hour) was still drop to a measely 500/hr but my kill death ratio per game was more or less 0.2 to 0.1, not that I'm complaining since I'm an objective based player, but there is a lot of scenarios that I would have gotten a kill and survived with heavy injuries, but still alive before this update rolled out.The changes are noticeble, infantry shield and hp was lowered , especially noticeble on the MAX suits , weapon damage was also changed for some of them. Some of the utility or special abilities of the class was changed in term of drain/ cooldown/ effect/ power , making a significant improvement in 1 of the classes but a significant drawback for the other. Graphics wise, it still looks the same but something has been change and is eating up my pc's power. Vehicles have been change as well and their weapons as well, mostly buffed. The point system is overall the same , that or slightly better. The deathcam has been improve I guess , but only slightly. The Hossin map is still under testing phase so the constant infantry and vehicles stuck are neglible and the map itself is good , thought that area lacks people playing. The teamwork of the game have mostly been lost , and objective based gameplay is pretty non-existent , most players now just care about their kill death ratio. The factions itself is now very unbalnced as well , it was about 30% TR , 30% NC , 40% VS when I last played , now its around 60% TR 30% NC and 10% VS. Now right now I maybe sound like some VS supporter, but mind you I play as all 3 factions and my favourite is TR because of their increased firerate and magazine size. But now the factions dominance is so unbalanced it's almost impossible for other minority to recover some of their bases. TR can fight on 3 front of the continent and win 2 of them, while the rest fight on the remaining continent barely making progress. As usual SOE still kept their currency at a decent price not too high and not too low. But the charge for most of the in game item is still expensive and the progress of getting cert ( the games earnable currency ) is still very bad grinding no matter how good you are. This is what gets me now, for all games I review based on 10 main things, the New user experience, the casual player experience, the experienced player experience, music , art style (or graphics) , price ( in this case in game microtransation items ) , progress (if the game has any) , its main theme ( multiplayer , single player , story telling , etc ) , its community , and  last but not least , the MOST important thing for games, whether you are satisfied playing the game or completely hated it or mutual ( short version : fun or not).New user (1 to 10 lvls) : Worst than before, the shield and hp system is very weak for the new user and hence they will die a lot faster and their starter weapons are not as good as they used to be.Casual players (5 to 40 lvls) : Overall not much has changed based on what I seen , you can play normally without getting 1 shotted most of the time and an advantage will normally guarantee your 1v1 scenarios.Experience players (41 and beyond) : Pretty much has all the infantry stuff mastered (not sure about vehicles ecause gameplay choices) , has very good gear that can overpower most low level enemy players and a very upgrade suit.Music : Hasnt changed from what Iheard from the 3 factions, them songs is still the same I believe with TR a bit sadistic , VS and bit weird and alien like, and NC as um... western texas type of music. Weapons sounds have been change and is sounds much better now.Graphics : No comment other than cant see cloaked inflitators while using low settings.Price : Free but in game microtransactions are a tad bit highProgress : Utterly slow at all levels unless you become a member, then you have a score system that actually means nothing when you think about it, cert gain is a pain as mentioned before ( exp 30 certs for a scope and 250 score pts to get 1 cert pts, so around 7500 score points to get just 1 scope) as for weapons, even longer as anyone would expect.Main theme : It should be a competitive multiplayer on a very very very large scale. It does that well at the start but because of the unbalnced faction, its not like that anymore, you either win or lose with a landslide on the normal to large scale battles (not accounting for the 4v4 base atk and def, cuz that's not large scale :P)Community : I chatted with the players in game, allies and enemies, visited the forums, overall quite good for a shooter, much much better than Call of Duty's community.Fun or not: As of the Hossin update no, unless you are leveled with decent suit upgrades and weapons, new users will get destroyed no matter what, even then the unbalanced faction wars couple with slow progress makkes the game a pain to play, statistically the weapons arent overpowered when compared with the dafault ones, but when you play, you will notice that its very different in comparison. For the paid or the one with the heart  to grind throught everything, its an enjoyable experience. At the based level we all deserve a free to play game that is fun right from the start, not after paying over 60USD or grinding 800 hours into the game.Serious Score: 47. 67 % (Note: decimals dont mean anything)Normal Score: 63. 54 % dropped as of Hossin Update",0
13883,Elsword,2017.0,"Some of the classes you choose will be completely boring and underpowered, while others will be flashy and overpowered. If you're new to the game, you've basically got a 50/50 shot of choosing a decent subclass. Balancing is hardly present, and the game runs in pvp like a laggy smash bros. This game's age shows INCREDIBLY hardcore. Way more than what it should. Just steer away and play other games. There's BDO, DFO, PSO2, etc.",0
6421,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewIt is:MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena I will take it it is a MOBA but doesn't have typical 3 lanes nor creeps. This is a battle of large capital ships. Even though ships are sluggish at the begining, games are not so slow and usually last 25 minuts. Game is built around team in mind in every aspect. To level up, whole team must take mining stations so entire team gets new level (ship upgrades). It is not possible to level up by killing ship but team with more ships get advantage - one player more means more firepower, more means to capture mines or infiltrate enemy base. Technically, feeding is not granting enemy any direct advantage.Ships do feel big and behave big. There are no plans to put in small combat ships - it is not the point of this game. Every ship feels different so with every unlocked ship, player must learn how to use it properly. Some ships have similar usage tho. Graphics are great but it is in early access and some optimization is needed.There are no paywalls not pay-to-win mechanics. In store there are only skins and items that can be purchased for ingame credits too. NOTE: Skins can be purchased only with real money.Game lack bigger player base. I hope it is only temporary thing as game offers really good fun.",1

10354,Fishing Planet,2016.0,"Early Access Reviewafter playing 7 hours straight and catching this most recent fish i decided that a review for this game would best be put in a story of the monster catch i made.                                                                 ----------------------------------------------- It was a dark, stormy afternoon. I had set out that morning with the few fishing accessories i could scrounge up after only 5 hours of fishing experience. Although all I had was a float caster, 3lb test and small cutbait to my name, I was soon to have a legacy. I went out in search of the biggest thing in my hometown lake, the aligator gar. I felt him nibbling at my hook, and it was all I could do to wait for the time when he was most vulnerable...BAM. he was on, and i was ready. he took me to the end of me line and held me there for what seemed like centuries. after he was done torturing me at that distance he was running low on power. I brought all the strength I had left to the end of my pole and pulled relentlessly against him. I tell you it was half past 2 by the time I got em this far. slowly i pulled him in, one foot at a time until he decided to get up and runoff again! I was disheartened by the affair but continued to pull him in. me friends all told me that it was an impossible task, break me line. oh no...not me. Ill never be conqured by a wee fish! now the time was 3:15 when i finally got him to 10 feet, and i had not a single foot o' pullin left in me so I ran into the water and jumped on him. I saw the beast in all his glory as i pulled him out of the water. my friends were amazed, never to speak an off word to me again. I became a legend that night, I became immortal.                                                                        ---------------------------over the course of hauling in the fish, it was the coolest experience ive had with a ftp game. the community is nice and helpful, the game is relaxing and overall its something worth wasting a lot of time on. The physics need work still since i was able to catch a 30 lb gar on 3lb test, but other than that Im very pleased with what ive seen so far and think its really worth playing.",1

4285,Paladins®,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI originally strongly recommended this game, but the developers have repeatedly ignored their community by implementing P2W and P2Progress(Gamble box bs) and just generally overreaching whenever possible. The game is easily in it's worst balance state to date, even worse than closed alpha.  Save yourself some time, play something else.In it's current state, I do not recommend it to anyone outside of America.  You cant choose what region you play in unless it's Ranked/Competitive mode, so until you reach a high enough level you have a very high chance of playing on excessively high ping :( Region selection has been fixed, it's still in a very, very rough state... somehow missing some sound effects and animations that were in the closed beta.

8544,War Thunder,2014.0,"This game has turned♥♥♥♥♥♥ I actually♥♥♥♥♥♥something out this morning that was less♥♥♥♥♥♥than this game. True story. The game is essentially a ploy to get you to pay them money. ""Free"" research points cannot be used unless you have eagles to convert them into usable research points... and of course eagles cost money. You can happily play through the first tier of planes for each region relatively easily, however as the tiers progress, the goals and upgrades become harder and harder to obtain, especially on free-to-play and thus push you towards getting a premium account or paying for game currency. When I first started playing the game, it certainly didn't have such an obvious push for cash but as the updates have rolled on, it's shown it's money grabbing side.Money aside, the game is relatively good. The arcade mode is most people's favourite, with realism lowered and more emphasis on action. There are however two other online modes: Real Battles and Simulation. The game also offers a single player mode and campaign. The gameplay itself has been simplified and allows for control almost entirely through a mouse. There is a vast array of aircraft for several different regions, all of which can be upgraded and to a limited extent, customised overtime. There are also a multitude of maps, most containing land/sea units which have to be eliminated along with airfields and bases. For more information read a better review than this one...",0

17733,Champions Online,2016.0," I paid for a month subscription to check out as much of the full game as I could. I spent nearly two hours building my hero, making sure not to use pieces that cost Zen (there is a large pop up in the right corner that tells you that you're using a piece that cost Zen, so it's obvious when you are). I get in game, and my entire hero is changed. Everything but base colors and the chest emblem. I log out, delete him, and start over, and now all the pieces I used now cost Zen for some reason, so I can't make the hero I want, even though I'm paying a monthly subscription fee.So, now, I am waiting on support to give me a refund on my subscription fee (my gold subscription was open for a total of .06 days according to my account page). The rep told me he was ""reviewing my account,"" and it's been over 20 minutes with no word on what's going on.I remember when this game first came out, and it was a lot of fun. It may still be, but I'll never know. If you want access to everything, you have to pay a monthly sub fee, AND buy/collect Zen in game (and you need a LOT of Zen to unlock everything). To hell with that.",0
287,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2018.0,"A solid and user-friendly simracing experience.The free content might as well not exist - there's not much, and I never liked it, although objectively the quality is pretty good. The real attraction is the paid stuff. Raceroom has some of the most diverse vehicle and track selections - you have generic GT3-spec, several years of ADAC GT3, WTCC, and an exclusive DTM license - complete with all the tracks. Some open-wheelers are available, but the only notorious one is the DW12 Indycar (aka FR US). Most iconic tracks are included - Spa-Francorchamps, Monza, Imola, a wonderful rendition of the Nuerburgring Nordschleife and much more. Quality wise, these are probably the best non-laserscanned tracks in the industry. Many more obscure venues appear too, mainly in Germany due to the DTM license.The physics are competent; I'm not the most qualified person to talk about them, but you definitely feel the gMotor engine underneath. The force feedback is arguably some of the best, and the vibration on the gamepad is undeniably the best. The AI is very convincing, definitely better than any other gMotor 2 title, and maybe even better than rFactor 2.Overall, very much recommended.",1
17867,Fractured Space,2017.0,One of the best free games i ever played in this kind of games. When i first started playing it i wouldnt have thouight that it was much for the world. But after severals hours behind it i could just say that this game gott me hooked! It is not a pay to win game. You could spend money on it but its just not worth it since you will end upp with things you really want after a couple of hours behind it. What you doo need is a good team on the battelfield and you will suceess with almost everything.The only bad things thats commes too my mind when i am writing this is that autobalance some times split partys too get more even teams. We should at least have been giving an option for if we want to be splited or not. Some minor buggs has comes out on the newest patch.

355,Fractured Space,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewNot bad so far. Very clunky and slow, there are seemingly drastic power differences between ships, and the loadout upgrades feel underwhelming/not compeling.The servers and game itself seem to have a bit of lag to them as well, even on a machine that far surpases the tech specs for the game. Still strangely fun though. Think MOBA in space, but not like you would a normal MOBA. Much of the skill elements involved in MOBA games are removed, especially reactive skill simply because the game is seemingly designed around being large, slow, clunky space ships. The only near exception to this would be the blink ability (flash from LoL) available to some ships.Recommended. Might as well try it, and maybe it will get better.",1

1584,War Thunder,2018.0,"To start, I should say that war thunder has been a positive influence on my life overall. When the community is good, it's great! I've formed many lasting friendships, and I'm currently in a relationship of almost a year with someone I met through the game.But war thunder has a problem with women. Not all players are like that--not even the majority. But enough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are loud enough to ruin the experience for so many girls I know, and we as a community can do better.I'm a woman. I like to play comp, and I get on voice to make call-outs and provide encouragement. For the most part, it's fine and we all have a good time (except when the enemy J1 somehow gets me every push.) But there are times when teammates get toxic in a way that doesn't get applied to male players. And sometimes the very presence of a female voice in the chat is enough to set people off--it's not funny when you ask me if I'll send nudes, or if I'll perform an obscene act for you. (Even if you're ""joking,"" it's really not funny, I promise.) It's grating to be continually asked if I'm a bomber main since I'm a girl, or for you to demand that I pocket you. (I don't play bomber. Sorry. How about naval planes?)It's especially not funny to be harassed, to have people make videos of them ""trolling"" me (and to receive dozens of hateful messages after), to be told to kill myself, to be called a bimbo and a♥♥♥♥♥♥and much, much worse. I've blocked people who then make multiple accounts to continually harass me. When playing with my girlfriend, we've been called all kinds of sexist epithets, plus an extra helping of homophobia when they find out we're dating.And despite all this, I still get on mic and speak. Partly because I'm not about to let a few sweaty manchildren ruin my gaming experience, but partly because it's more than just me. Time and time again, I've had other girls timidly get on mic when they hear my voice and express their relief at hearing another girl. They say they don't usually talk out of fear, but that it's nice to hear a friendly voice. People say that there aren't any girl gamers, but that couldn't be further from the truth--you've just create a climate where they're too scared to talk, because many of them have experienced the same things as me.I know most of you are decent people. I'm lucky to have a close circle of players who are talented, kind people. But we as a community need to do a better job of standing up against this kind of poor behavior. More than just reporting it when you see it (although I wholly recommend doing that): make it known that you don't tolerate sexist conduct. Even a simple ""hey man, that's not cool"" can both (1) let the harasser know that their behavior isn't condoned and (2) let the harassee know that decent people do exist. The silence of complicity and the silence of dissent sound the same--speak up to make your true colors shine.So please: be mindful, foster an environment that welcomes female players, and don't forget to bomb the airfield!ETA: Thanks for the (mostly) supportive response, I appreciate it! It means a lot to me that the average person still knows how to be polite. Like I said, it's the good eggs who make this community what it is.A couple people have said things akin to ""this is the internet, grow a thicker skin, etc."" I'm well aware of how the internet can be, and I do have a tremendously thicc skin as a result. It's not me I'm worried about; a lot of people don't have such a thicc skin, and it's those girls who aren't as hardened as I am who really suffer. Just because I'm a hardened shrew doesn't mean we all have to be.People have also said things akin to ""if you don't want to be subject to homophobic harassment when you're playing with your girlfriend, you shouldn't announce to people that you guys are dating."" Aside from putting the blame on me (which I think is unfair), I don't think these people understand the dynamics at play. It's not like I announce to everyone ""Hey guys, this is my girlfriend! We are dating!"" (although I really ought to, because she's a phenomenal woman). What generally happens is one of us will refer to other as ""babe"" during a game (e.g., ""nice pilot knockout, babe""), then someone asks if we're dating, and then all hell breaks loose.Also, every person who responded to this post with ""shut up bomber ♥♥♥♥♥"" just proved my point.

I have to pay money to play it. Konami only wants my money!- No, you don't have to pay anything. Through lots of gameplay and grinding, you can earn any card. I've been playing it for almost quite a while now and I've only paid money once - and I did it 'cause I wanted to, not 'cause I felt like I had to do it. And it's not pay-to-win, which most free games are.2. The events suck!!- I will admit that there have been events that were lackluster, but most of them are great opportunities to get new cards and unlock characters.3. All of the new cards they're releasing now suck!!- You do realize how many cards there are in the Yu-Gi-Oh card game, right? And if you know the game, you know that not all of the cards are great. That's just how the game is. And the game has been doing a great job of constantly adding new cards to try out - and also, they resently released the Yubel cards, which are super powerful.

You have to buy better towers and their upgrades with ingame currency which is awarded by winning games. You pay to a special amount of coins to play a game, if you win you get two times as much back. You start with 0 coins and by winning 7 games you get a ranking in the world/region ladders where reaching different ranks awards a good amount of coins every wednesday.So if you start playing sunday, you get how the game works on monday, win a few games on thusday and get the coins on wednesday, you have gone from 0 to 1000+ coins in 3 days and max. 30 wins!After this you could get worlds first in your second week of playing, even in the first week, because it's pLay2win!On another note, you need to win games to unlock the purchase of better towers and their upgrades, so once more you need to PLAY to get better!Also if you don't want to waste your money, don't spend any!

20232,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"This will be a short summary of the game and its main Pros and Cons that new players would be interested in knowing.Pros:Great gameplayInteresting skills treeGreat stat system, choose what you want to advance in. want to be a physical wizard? put stats into strength! .. ectNice art styleRequires Grinding but it feels rewarding.real time battle system (attack and actually move out the way of attacks to not get hit). Massive level cap with a much higher cap to come. Cons:Grinding (if it is not your thing)Lag, even on a GTX 780 TI Gaming Overclocked and a i7 I get major lag at times, sometimes completely halting movement and button inputs. 72 hours wait until you can trade or use the market (attempt to stop gold sellers...Still gold sellers everywhere)POTENTIAL! an element to items, want to trade? lose some potential on the item, meaning you cant upgrade it as much.No free trading between characters, to trade for free between characters you will lose 2 potential as you have to trade with a friend and back (really irritating, stops you being able to fully upgrade the item).The game is fun and interesting but is held back by the games attempt to keep gold sellers away and to keep the economy of griding alive. Id recommend playing it, its free and it is in essence a brilliant MMO with loads of content.",1
15350,Path of Exile,2016.0,"Basically this excellent game is a free to play Diablo 2 with a character improvement system that is QUITE REMINISCENT to the Sphere Grid  from Final Fantasy  X. Except that the grid itself is... ridiculously big. And if you are just playing casually, you can use it to develop your character in ways you want.But if you are fairly serious, you will need to find out  ways to actually build effective and efficient characters, having entire trees planned beforehand.And then you will need to get quite lucky or trade successfully, because skills are not bound to a character. That is both the game's greatest strength and greatest weakness, in my opinion. The skill system is  INCREDIBLY flexible, being more similar to FF7's materia system than anything else. Skills come in the form of ""virtue gems"", which you get to slot into items with the appropriate colored slots.Said gems mostly come in rare, random drops. You either need to trade for them (easier now since there are vendors that do sell some useful gems now), win  many of them on quests, or trade with the community.Extremely flexible, and if diablo 2 gameplay mixed with FF7 skill systems and FFX sphere grid character growth sounds interesting, you will probably devote many many hours in this title.The ingame shop is only for cosmetic items, storage space and character slots, as far as I know, so there is no such thing as a pay to win scheme in this game.EXTREMELY recommended.",1
17102,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is possibly one of the worst games in steam, it has a huge potential to be good.

11008,Digimon Masters Online,2016.0,"I'm impatient. That means for a lot of people, this review is useless.I never got as far as finishing the tutorial, for many reasons;1. Awful translations. It made it hard to understand, and kind of ruined the story line.2. Following on from the previous point, spoken text wasn't formatted. It may seem like a small point, but theword completed often followed on to the next line. This just added to the general dislike of the game.3. Controls. These weren't appauling, but it is entirely a point and click game, which is not my preference.4. Bad graphics.5. Character choices were already given a backstory. Which would have been cool, had you it not have been a mmo, where the characters aren't unique. 7. The digimon to choose from were all ok except falcomon. He belonged to one of the choosable characters. This in a way makes you feel like you have to use it if you choose the above mentioned character, and you can't use it otherwise.8. Just in general, the layout wasn't great, of both the screen and the scenery. For one of the tasks, i had to climb up stairs. But it was zoomed in so much you could only climb up by tapping the ground directly in front of you over and over again.So it may get better, but I'm deleting this game. Which is a shame, since i had high hopes.",0
9871,Path of Exile,2017.0,"My personal favorite ARPG. The leveling system is expansive allowing for a range of builds, naturally varying from the obscene and the useless up to the content destroyers. Featuring a great community and a fantastic dev team who are constantly trying to fix issues and interacting with their playerbase with huge updates every year adding new content. Furthermore the ""Unique"" items which are rare item drops that have special properties are actually interesting and can even define new builds. Some are better suited for leveling but others add new mechanics that beautifully combine with the other skills available in the game. And to top it all off: It is free to play. The game does feature microtransactions, mainly purely cosmetic however it is definitely worth putting in a small bit of money to purchase additional stash tabs to relief some of the constant inventory management, especially if you have a tendancy to hoard everything. Nothing can be bought which will  'improve' your character, so no pay to win elements.",1

5210,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"This game is fun and challenging.In this game you build a Fallout Shelter. Then the dwellers arrive at your vault door. That is when things start to become a challenge.You have several things that you need to keep an eye on. The first of these are three meters which measure how much food, water and energy you have in your vault. These are very important. You want to keep them full. If they fall too low, it lowers the overall happiness of your vault dwellers.The more rooms you build in your vault, the more energy it consumes.The more dwellers you have the more food and water they consume.The other things you need to watch for is the happiness meter and the bottlecap meter. The hapiness meter tells you the vault's average happiness and the bottlecap meter tells you how much money you have. You can also bring up a view of all your dweller's and view their status, which includes happiness, their job and how they are equiped. You can equip your dweller with clothing, weapons and a pet.Now the most important rooms that you will want to build when you start out are Living Quarters, Power Station, Water Station and Diner. This will allow you to get the first of your dwellers started. These rooms cost bottle caps to build, so be careful of how many you start off with right away. You don't want to use up all of your bottlecaps. Now will start out with 7 Dwellers at the vault door. You can drag them to the appropriate rooms and assign them jobs. You can determine the right jobs by another meter called the S.P.E.C.I.A.L Meter. Dweller has their own. This meter shows you the dweller'sStrengthPerceptionEnduranceCharismaInteligenceAgilityLuckIf your dweller is high in Strength you would assign them to the Power Station.High Perception would be assigned to the Water StationAgility would be assigned to the Diner.More rooms will unlock as you play. Each of these rooms will be governed by one of these SPECIAL stats.Your Dweller's can also produce baby dwellers as well. Baby dwellers happiness will remain at 50% until they are grown and can be placed in a job.To make things more interesting, your vault can have various disaster incidents occure. It can be attacked by raiders or infested by radroaches or even catch on fire.Lastly, you can send your dweller out of the vault on quests in which they can fine and bring back various loot and bottlecaps.It is a fun game and more challenging you might think.",1

6136,War Thunder,2016.0,"This game is absurdly biased towards the Russian vehicles. I would not recommend it to anyone based on the fact that the developers will not admit that, and chose to cite sekret Russian dokuments as the reason why Russian vehicles are so absurdly OP.A prime example is the new TU-4, a Russian copy of the American B-29 with larger engines, cannons, and payload capacity. But is is impossible to shoot down compared to the B-29 which can be shot down simply by looking at it. Instead of removing the bias from the TU-4 they bumped it up to a 7.0 BR from a 6.3 BR. This does absolutely nothing, as the games horrible match making as of late will still put the 7.0 TU-4 against the 6.3 B-29 which may as well be made of card stock.

It doesn't have towers that you shoot, just cap points you sit on. The enemy base isn't your target, you jut cap and wait for time. It's not fun anymore.

My internet is just fine, works great on every other game.  I'm in the US so I guess all the servers are in EU, so no NA Servers.  I didn't realise how far this game has fallen.  The remaining players in the community are very toxic and elitest.  Didn't want to believe all the negative reviews on this game because I remember it being very good back in 2014 when I last played.  I do like the overhauled flight controls and new planes, but it doesn't mean anything if half my team is lagging.  Not to mention the air spawns are awful.  Enemy planes can spawn right behind you.  Still no way to enable a toggle for aiming down sight.  You have to hold down right click while you shoot wih left click.  Never had any game do that before, it feels so awkward shooting like this.Overall check the game out if you have nothing else to play and want a few hours of entertainment for free.  But don't expect an amazing WW2 Game.  This is a poor man's battlefield unfortunately.  This game could have been great but it's going further and further down hill.  Pretty soon there wont be much of a player base left and it will take half an hour to get into games.The more proof I see about how the Staff treats People on their forums is disgusting me.

13082,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI got this game as a gift several months ago. When I got the game, I encountered a game of creativity and of combat, which I liked. The game's ranking system made sure you were matched with comparable bots with comparable armaments, which resulted in fairly intense matches with two nearly equally matched teams. However, as of the latest big update, the game suffers from a horrible game balance issue. Weapons are now handed out at random, and 'rare' weapons are able to unilaterally dominate battles. The new crate system intends to reward good gameplay, but the tiering of crates is largely cosmetic, with the highest teir gear being practically the same rarity in low tier crates as in high tier crates. Their rarity is hardly a justificaton for the weapons' power, especially since for a few bucks, people can buy the highest tier crates. Robocraft discourages new players by pitting them against the power weapons with little to defend themselves. Robocraft discourages the creative process by making roughly three styles of vehicles the only survivable ones, and by making the power weapons so costly to add to a bot (in terms of pFlops, the game's unit of bot complexity) that if a bot is to be effective, it must be extremely basic with a power weapon on it. Robocraft discourages veterans of the game by making the level system and robot rank system nearly obsolete, turning the game's tech tree into a game of chance. The power weapons were originally only available by purchase, so the update did do good by taking previous 'pay to win' weapons and making them at least remotely accessible for free. But Robocraft is no longer a game of skill and creativity. Its balancing points have become a wheel of fortune, a wheel that can be greased by money (that runs a risk of being wasted since rarities still exist in the purchasable crates).In short, the game used to be fun. Once again in gaming history, crates corrupted the game.",0

1325,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAlmost 10hrs in, and it feels so damn good. Pros:- Fast response time with key inputs.- Smooth shooting mechanics.- Clean Map design.- Great Weapon design. It's easy to see the differences between the weaponry.- Cool looking vehicles.- Balanced class system. No real advantage in choosing a class over another, just a different moving ability with different inventory space.- End-Game really engaging and different from other BRs.Cons:- Optimization could be better. On a 1080 and i7 6700 the game struggles to keep 60FPS.- Pickaxe class could use a little boost in speed when climbing a rock wall. Climbing makes you slow and vulnerable.- 3D sound design could be improved. Sometimes it's hard to tell where you're getting shot from.8/10 so far. Cons are not big enough to penalize the game.

It bouldly goes where no asspoop has gone before, except maybe that Star Trek game that costs actually human money.I'm reviewing this for it's gameplay, not plot, cuz I skipped all the story things.First there's a surprisingly non-testicular character creator, this concludes my list of pros.I chose to be a starfleet person for reasons of reasons, and was booped into San Francisco anno 2400 or somewhere around ther, I know it's San Francisco because it's shouted at me trough voice-acting and the golden gate is pushed up into my face. My first quest is to go and talk to someone, so is my second one, and third, and fourth, and fifth (after it let me talk to the guy), and sixth. As my seventh quest I have to go and toast cuz I graduated from space-school or something before I get sent to a spaceship that; MAJOR SPOILERS OF SOMETHING NOBODY WOULD PREDICT IN A GAME AT ALL, the ship gets attacked. You then do yada yada for a couple of minutes (one of which was breaching a door I couldn't quite find because the doors don't work at all and you just go through all of them) before I get to control the ship (which the dialogue might explain but I skipped it.

2329,Path of Exile,2017.0,"I've absolutely been amazed at the progress this game has made since it was released. At that time I felt it was the Diablo 3 that should have been released by Blizzard. It has superb gameplay, decent graphics and was every bit as good as top tier action RPGs.Since that time, my love for the game has not waned. With every update, they add more content, new items and quests, NPCs, etc. For a free game, it is simply the best. One of the best aspects of the game is- NO PAY TO WIN!! Grinding Gear promised this would never be play to win, and it still is not four years later, yet the game continues to expand. All you can buy through microtransactions are cosmetics, pets that don't help you fight in any way, and supporter packs. I don't mind buying little enhancements to my character's looks just to support devs who have actually stuck by what they said, and continue to give fans a reason to keep coming back to play the game. Keeps  me working for that dank loot! The story line isn't bad either, with great voice acting. If you like Diablo, you'll also appreciate and enjoy POE. It's one of the best out there, and for a free to play game, you just can't ask for any more than that.Keep it up GG, you are making a legacy here that will be around for a long time I feel.",1

15645,School of Dragons,2014.0,"""School of Dragons"" is such a cute game. While there is a bit of negative pointers in my opinion, I do recommend this to those who do not mind  simple gaming. Withing the two hours I been playing ""School of Dragons"", I realize it's nothing to be overjoyed about however it is a game to waste some time at if your day consists of nothing other than staring at a clock. Graphics: I have seen better graphics in a lot of games, but these are not bad. However, depending on how smooth your computer runs things; the graphics may look different to other players. Worst yet, there is no options to lower the standards except to window/fullscreen the game perhaps.   6/10GamePlay: There is nothing special about this game play, do quest, raise your dragon and do mini-games. Pretty repetitive but again most games tend to be. You're lucky to get mini-games out of this as other games may not have that. 4/10Maps/Areas: School of Dragons have a few different maps to choose from which is nice to see despite they may not be very big. Sadly, there needs to be a stronger format/coding/ect as some players can get stuck in some places or appear as if they are in mid-jump on a bridge. It's not horrifying though and can easily be ignored if you don't run your dragon into the ground in tight areas. 5/10Bugs: There is a few bugs that can be easily spotted. I had an issue when I first entered the game; After hopping on Toothless, it showed the rings we had to go through but after Hiccup finished talking they disappeared and I was unable to proceed to the next area. All you need to do is restart the game and it will be fine. Some other bugs will not be mentioned as they are not dramatic. While I don't feel like breaking this whole game apart due to it's childish gameplay, I will mention that this game is not as awful as people have made it seem. Yes it has it's down points like any other game, yes there are options to pay in-game however it is not Pay to Play* and yes it's a child's game. **The game offers in-game payment options to be a member. This does not mean it's ""Pay to Play"" as pay to play simply means to use real currency to continue in the game, become stronger/immortal, and unlock classes etc that are not available any other way. Paying in-game grants you membership which simply means;-No Ads (Original Website)-500 Free Gems Monthly*-All Flight Club Dragons*-20% Off InStore-Hiccups Flightsuit-Your Own Toothless**Gems help you buy a lot of stuff in the game however does not generally affect how you get through the game. Gems are used to by costumes, unnecessary gold that can be earned through jobs and quests, farm accessories to make your farm look better than the rest, dragons and gear, consumables that really have no use except restoring energy which you can do by fishing. Yes you can by better dragons, but default dragons can be just as good. **All Flight Club dragons are not your own personal dragons and may just help you get a better grade in that class. By default you can use your own dragon or Terror. Unlocking them is not a necessity.Anyone can play just as good as a person who pays.",1
965,WARMODE,2015.0,Early Access ReviewAlthough i have only played this for few minutesI would recommend this game to you first of all because its free and small only about 200MB there is no reason not to try itit is not P2W The only thing we must pay for is the badges and mask which are pure cosmetics no buffs or anythinggame is like CS with Aim down sight all weapons are unlcockjust picture this CSGO with no skins and with slightly low graphicif the Developers are reading this please add team balance because in my first match i was the mercs with 4 other players againts 2 player and add a feature so that you can create your own serveragain you can try this game for yourself because it is free and small if u dont like it just uninstall it ,1
424,AdventureQuest 3D,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAdventure Quest 3D is basically like Adventure Quest Worlds put in 3D. The game is pretty much what you would expect from a Beta game. It is missing many cool features that were in AQW. For example you can't upgrade armor, meaning if you got a low level armor that you prefer more than some of the high level ones whoop de doo. I have completed all of the available quests for now and I'll be honest it took me 40 hours to get to level 15 with massive grinding. Storyline is decent so far and the classes in the game are also cool. I didn't understand one thing though you get to pick a class at the beginning, but it doesn't matter which one you take cause you can swap classes on the go, basically like Runescape at that aspect. Overall a fun game to play for some time at least and Multiplatform so far works great.",1

14778,SMITE®,2018.0,"Not very beginner friendly. Ive spent 270+ dollars on this free to play game. Half of the money was spent on chests and most of the things I got from chests were avatars and voice packs. Extremely fun to play with friends. Great free game. I've enjoyed almost every second of it. Parts I do not like about the game: Queue time is sometimes pretty crazy for some gamemodes, Loki is a fair and balenced piece of fairness that should go and stomp on legos; And I cannot wait till Baron Samedi gets nerfed. Perfect free 3rd person MOBA game. 9.9/10 fix loki or I will main him. ;)",1

13340,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,just amazing needs more tanks like the actual one thats why i always wait for more updates hopefully it is still diffrent from the console versions / bigger versionsperfect for smaller running laptops or perfect for handheld devise (i have it on my tablet with same account and tanks so it nice that it can be transfured from multiple devices),1
5732,PlanetSide 2,2015.0,One of the best F2P games out there right now but I still get the feeling its trying to lean more towards paying players with the station cash you can buy to get access to better or different weapons quicker than getting certs but thankfully you can't buy vehicle upgrades with them or perks for your class. Still definitely recommend to a friend and i've had a lot of fun memories with this game!,1
15858,Neverwinter,2016.0,"just put it this way, the game is F2P, its an RPG, lots of folks play, you can still quest and do dungeons even without the super rare legendary ""ive been playing a lot longer than you"" gear. could the game use some more work, yeah, but the way it is, the game is still decent. IMO, they should focus on improving the game overall rather than keep releasing new modules. or at least focus on game mechanics, etc for next two major updates, then go back to releasing modules. i may not have a lot of time invested in the game to voice my opinion about the game overall, but i like RPG's and while im not a hardcore player, im sure somebody would value this opinion/review.",1
3887,Path of Exile,2018.0,I really enjoy the game it is a close design set up to Diablo. The Problem is the imbalance to elemental resistance is insane I am playing as a elementalist running to point to where I am doing almost no damage even with switching between elements. Or even using gems to penetrate the resistance it feels like the game is geared to much toward warriors or summoners. It punishes you for playing the way you enjoy to where it takes the enjoyment away. I love a chalenge and a hard game but I don't enjoy a game that trolls certain classes.,0
13723,School of Dragons,2018.0,"Product received for freeI think we can all agree that School of Dragons is nothing more but a scam of a kids game. And it's all because of gems. Gems everywhere. You need gems to get dragons, you need gems to open rare chests, you need gems to buy more stables, and you need more gems to buy coins if you don't wanna do quests, and on, and on, and ON! This game is demanding for you to spend all of the money that you have in your wallet so that you can enjoy the game. Sure, there are ways you can obtain gems, be it invitations, watching videos, stuff like that, but this is just nuts. That's why we've got hackers all over School of Dragons. because gems are very costly. You want the max load of gems? You gotta pay $100 dollars. You want membership for a whole year? Pay $85 and you'll get your wish! Even PSN isn't this bad, with only $60 for a whole year. Sure it's still expensive, but that's to be expected from Sony, not a company that made those little pc games for little kids. Bugs, glitches, hackers, the works. It's all because JumpStart is nothing but money grabbing monster, robbing both you or your money and of your sanity with all its flaws.. Don't let your kids spend all of your money onto this game, else you're gonna try calling them, and they won't even respond to your call, or just say something completely different, ignoring your problem.. Which, I'm pretty sure they don't. I pray that after the release of How to Train your Dragon 3, can we get a game like this, but less tedious, more visually appealing, more freedom, and most importantly of all, not being a ""Pay to Win"" game.But knowing how movie based console games usually are, I don't think we can ever get a game like that,Burn in hell, JumpStart.",0

Believe me when i say this nothing really has changed. This is a new company/developer which i still find it hard to believe. The question that gets me is that this developer team was working on this game for 2 years now.. If that is true,many things shouldve been changed. Im talking new characters, new sounds, different models, and new housing structures.. In 2 years these soo called new developers made a copy and paste adding some new weapons, adding a new base/town to the map, and adding a new game mode battle royal.  That is the only thing they changed. The entire game still plays/acts the same. FYI the screenshots on steam is not what the game looks like!!! If you like this type of game deff look into ""romero's aftermath"". Samething as this but more things you are able to do.ProsMap has somehwat changed from old infestationNew weaponsKilling players= xp and moneyConsYou can buy apcs, and cars at the store for a priceRandom crashesToo many weapons spawnThe sky at night time is still ugly!!Zombies still get stuck on roadszombies glitch hitting you twice instead of once with one hitYou can disconnect anywhere and place all your items in global inventory.

8132,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2014.0,"There are a lot of great MMO's out there. Maybe this has the core concept of being one of them, however it is extremely outdated.

5554,Trove,2016.0,"The game was of a mediocre kind of Dungeons and Dragons Skyrim sort of Minecraft knock-off, but it was fairly on the better side of knock-offs, but that's also one of many reasons why I'm giving it a bad review.  The game itself is fairly fun, minus the ungodly amount of lag, and all the in-app purchases keeping you from having too much fun.  Now I will talk about the controls.  If it were for IOS, or ANDROID, I would have let this go, but the ""controls"" barely controlled anything, much less everything.  Personally, I'm not very biased against knock-off F2P games, but it was just too impossible to play without the egregious amount of IAPs, and without a solid controller option.All in all, I'd give this game a 2/10, and would recommend nearly any game over this virtually unplayable game without hackers(and there are plenty of those).1/10(with hackers)",0
6510,Trove,2018.0,"I used to adore this game a year or two back, and if you included the number of hours I've put in outside of steam, that makes  at least 600 hours. But, in traditional Trion style, the game got progressively more p2w and you had to do even more grinding to even come close to the level of someone who put their wallet up. Although it introduced a new layer of depth to game, the gem system also added even more grind in addition to huge RNG. How did you get around this? Well, buying around it, of course!While I'm not sure how the game is in it's current state, knowing Trion the game's problems have likely only gotten worse. so I would not recommend this game to anyone. The grind is monotinous and the devs usually just end up spitting in your face. There are much better f2p games on steam alone.",0

2154,theHunter Classic,2016.0,"Ok, the F2p bit is stretching it a bit far since you only get 2 free weapons and ammo at the beginning which does allow you to hunt various animals, but all being said; it is value for money.The 3mth membership alone you don't find in most games, and ok you have to buy the weapons but tbh since you earn gm's for the ammo you're laughing.This is not a game to waste your money on as you can waste your money quite quickly. It is what it says on the tin, The hunter, you hunter; them animals; you hunt and get better at hunting. All you need to get going is your Computer or Laptop, your Mouse and a lot of your Patience, have them and you're already on your way to be a hunter.

Everytime I get killed I cut a little slit in my arm to hopefully teach me not to die. It has not been working and I have gone into a deep depression. I do not recemmend purchasing this game that infects you with a spite to kill yourself and other, and that creates a void that only gets filled from winning matches and getting promoted.

19842,Realm of the Mad God,2014.0,"Never played a game that felt so unfair in my life. It's not even a matter of the game being hard, it's UNFAIRLY hard. Enemies will shoot projectiles at you that are the same color as the floor, and in situations like that the projectiles are basically completely invisible. Enemies shoot bullets in lines, and there are absolutely no i-frames whatsoever, so getting outright oneshot is a pretty common occurance. The permadeath idea is interesting in concept, but every almost every microtransaction in the game is for your character, and if you die the money you spent is just gone. That's incredibly predatory and anti-consumer.The production quality of the game is absolutely abyssmal; resizing the window will completely distort the aspect ratio of the game, fullscreening the game is a nightmare because there are buttons that just disappear. You can't even hit 'play' if you have the game at certain resolutions. You can't rebind your mouse buttons at all whatsoever, I wanted to rebind functions to my mouse and the game doesn't let you do it at all without an external program changing your moust buttons to keyboard keys. The default settings of the game in general are detrimental to you, if you don't change your settings you're playing at a disadvantage.Despite all this, I was determined to give the game a fair chance, so I did some research on how to progress and make your character stronger. Basically, the 'grind' of this game is to improve your sustainability so you can grind faster and take less damage. Grindy games can be fun, but there's no real objective to the grind in this game, no end-goal you're trying to achieve besides just maxing your characters stats, and once you max your defense you're basically in the clear for maxing the rest of your stats. The problem I found with this is that the strategy for maxing defense is to a) grind for defense up potions, or b) grind for other stat ups and trade for defense ups. Defense potions are extremely dangerous to get and put your character in extreme risk, so if you want to be as safe as possible, you'll be grinding a common dungeon called ""Sprite World"".Sprite World is an eyesore and most likely a trigger for epilepsy. In addtion there are no walls so enemies will shoot at you over pits you can't traverse over, only around, and there are conveyor belts everywhere that makes movement much more difficult than it needs to be, especailly considering that the actual enemies in the dungeon are not that threatening. So you grind dozens of Sprite Worlds to get stat ups you can trade for defense ups.But the next problem that arises is that trading in this game is inexcusably terrible. There's no auction house, no place to post your trade offers ingame, nothing. It's all handled through an external website that might not even be managed by the developers of the game.All in all, this is one of the most frustrating games I've ever played. I died a few times and not once did I feel like I had control over what happened. You can get bursted down in less than a second, and even though there's a built in 'return to town' button, the game doesn't always register it in time to save you; I had a couple occasions where I smashed the key at half-health and then just died anyway.The only redeeming factor in this game is that the community is absolutely fantastic, for some odd reason. People will just walk up to you and give you higher tiered items when you're starting out, and in turn when I found higher tier gear I couldn't use I gave it away to keep the cycle going. Most of the time people are very friendly and will actually answer your questions. This however does not make up for the fact that the game is over six years old and has zero quality of life features that make the game more user friendly. This could've been a good game if the developers cared about accessibility instead of microtransactions.",0
984,Minion Masters,2018.0,"Early Access Reviewso this is basically a RTS magic the gathering game. and dont let early access fool you its complete enough to enjoy fully as it is but ive already been pleased with the devs update frequency and content . Anyways,  the most important thing is this game is fun really fun and you dont have to buy anything. though i enjoyed it so much that i decided to support the devs and purchase an account upgarde pack that gives me some extra deck slots and a gold boost. the game play is fast and tactical and is literally summoning creatures that have a preset AI to go out on a two lane battlefield and defend your caster while simultaniously trying to attack your opponents castpor. the matches last for about 2-7 minutes and theres alot of good combo building and deck constructing elements, and it really tempts you to play ""just one more game"" after each match ends. there is a pay element if you want to buy their premium currency but the only thing you can buy with it that you cant get for free is most (not all) of the skins. they really give alot of free stuff starting out and daily (including that premium currency) and i dont think youd ever need to buy anything if you didnt want to and you would still be able to build  several very good decks without having to grind ridiculous hours.  its also got a neat multiplayer team mode that lets you play along with someone else vs another team and its alot of fun to get matched with random people and be able to cordinate with no communication. i really recomend it and think i will be playing it for quite a while.its free!!feels balanced so far and devs seem active and post regular updates and free expansion content.Its really, truly fun with a nice techno fantasy sort of theme (think masters of the universe or maybe thundar the barbarian)game play is intuitive and you can pick it right up without much tutorial game play is quick and match making is good so its easy to get a few games in whenever youve got a couple of minutesthere are lots of game modes and events goign on so there feels like a decent amount to doits free!! so if it sounds at all appealing you should give ti a try",1

2159,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,"Part I: TanksIf I was asked to put it in one word, I'd say: Frustrating.Second word would be: Dissapointing.Third: Hopeless.Frustrating because there are so many flaws, broken mechanics, plain stupid game design decisions that you will get tons of negative emotions out of this ""game"". Lets name a few (not evey by all means, there are too many): 1. Physics. They are bearable, but primitive leaving you with an impression of a very cheap or old game. Tank wont pass through wire or can be stopped with a car parked on his path. We are talking about a moving tank btw.2. Balance. There is none. 2 to 4 tiers of tanks in each category: lights, mediums, heavies and TDs. Balancer does not take tiers into account meaning you will fight T-70 in your Pz Ia (you can't pen their armor) or Chaffies in your T-38 (they will kill you in 3 seconds. Not a pleasant experience, And it will take you few months to grind to Panther or T34-85. And keep in mind that intermediate tiers are not worth buying, so if you are a fan of grinding and suffering this game is for you and that review is not.3. Stupid game design decisions. Reto managed to create a situation where tanks are both frustrating to play for and against. As an infantry its not fun to be killed over and over again by HEs with 20 m splash from another half of the map. Mind that tanks have like 3 sec reload (some) so these splashes will hit often. On the other hand it takes just 2 magnetic grenades to kill a tank and there is no way to see them coming as tanks have limited vision. So you have to rely on your teammates. Random teammates. Good luck with that. Or you can bring friend who will waist his time guarding your tank. You know what will be a reaction of a Kings Tiger driver when he hears an infantry whistle somewhere near? RUN, RUN for your life! Like a terrified dear through the woods. Yeah! Thats what these so called developers (a community laughing stock) managed to create.Dissapointing as the concept is good. But devs are not. They are lazy, greedy and unproffesional. So, a wasted opportunity. Hopeless for the same reasons.",0

3710,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2016.0,"First off, this game is great, for both Tolkien fans and people who haven't even seen the movies. This game has everything it needs to be a great MMO. Here are some more details with pros and cons:So the best part of this game is easily the story, I play for the stories. The Epic Quests are generally the best, but there are some really cool side quest lines too which are fun to play along. It's also cool to have Monster Play, to be able to conquer outposts and hunt down Free Players is quite satisfying. The classes, at least from what I've seen, are all unique and fun to play, each in their own way, which is cool too. Here's some stuff to keep in mind though.THIS GAME ISN'T TOTALLY FREE. Or at least, if you want to play totally free, it's going to take a TON of effort and a lot of hunting random creatures to fulfill deeds to get LOTRO Points. But there comes a point, after you've finished playing through the Lone Lands and you've played along the Epic Quest series in the North Downs, that you have to buy Evendim to continue the epic story line, which is usually something like 700 LOTRO points, and by that time I had raked up about 600, and there was, luckily a sale going on. But, I'm trying to make the point that in order to continue playing the game you are going to need a lot of LOTRO Points. Aside from that, other cons include the fact that Middle-Earth is too stinking massive and unless you use LOTRO Points to buy yourself a horse, you have to run everywhere, at least until you've discovered all the stablemasters. So that can be pretty boring.But in the end, I still find this game enormously entertaining, You can make it all the way to Level 40 without even needing to worry about buying another region if you follow all the side quests. The story is cool, engaging and original, staying true to Lord of the Rings Canon, while building off of ALL the loose ends that Tolkien left out there to create really cool stories. So yes, I highly recommend this game.",1
14610,Path of Exile,2018.0,"Go big or go home.PoE is, at its core, all about RNG. RNG loot drops are the core game mechanic. As one person put it ""Fighting loot, finding monsters."" The game has plenty to recommend it: great graphics, inspiring sound & music, a deep meta game whereby the number of possible character builds is nearly endless, great customisation and the best MTX system I've yet seen in a game where 95% of all items that can be purchased with real money are purely cosmetic in nature. The other 5% are quality of life items that do not in any way make PoE pay to win. This is how all game companies should do microtransactions.My problem with PoE is that the nature of the RNG systems means that actually useful items are *incredibly* rare. The entire game economy appears to be designed with the 1% twitch broadcasters in mind who play thousands of hours of PoE & nothing else. That's fine, but it essentially locks an actually significant amount of the game content behind difficulty walls that can only be breached by spending huge amounts of time playing. If like me you have very limited gaming time between real life stuff, work, family etc then I would seriously recommend that you will likely only find frustration in this game and you should look elsewhere. My ~500 hours (at the time of writing) have been accumulated over the past 5 years.If you're willing to put in the time the sheer range of possibilities that PoE offers, and the deep meta game are very rewarding and for these players PoE is the best ARPG available. If however you have limited gaming time or play casually then don't bother, you're not the target audience for this game unfortunately.Would I recommend PoE? Yes, but only because I enjoy playing with my friends. This is not a game that I play solo because the sheer size of the mindless grind to get the best gear is frankly unbelievably boring.",1

19357,Path of Exile,2018.0,"In Short: Path of exile is a must try/play game if you enjoy ARPG games.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Path of exile started in 2013 and is still growing , path of exile brings ARPG that gives massive ways of building your character and the design is quite gotich type.Story:Now when it comes to story for me itself the story was ""Eh .... ""not saying that story is bad ,but will say that it didn't realy drag me in that much too feel amazed not to mention that i didn't realy dig that much through dialog from characters.-Graphics:The game as i said looks Gothic style too me ... but even thought it looks like that what makes me a bit annoyed is how your character feels like♥♥♥♥♥♥when it comes to design (no matter how much you try you will still look almost like a Hobo if you don't start buying some cosmetics or earn them through events).-Gameplay:PoE did great when it comes to gameplay and how its abilitys works THERES SO MUCH when it comes to making your build its soo fun Example: You found a fireball and now you want it to be even more good ... OK just slap multi shot and slap more stuff and combine gems and all that and you get some EPIC cluster ♥♥♥♥ ability that is so satisfying that your PC freezes.Than we got a MASSIVE skill tree ... realy massive i ain't kidding.What i don't enjoy about Path of exile doe is that your own build if you are not experienced with the game will 75% SUCK, the close you are to the end the more and more you see your build failing.Now its not always gonna be like that but still the game allows you to build anything , But if you wanna reach to the end you will probably have to stick too few common things even though you don't want to.

8972,Brawlhalla,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewYou wanna know if brawlhalla is worth downloading? Well, first of all its just 200Mb of a free game, so why are you even reading reviews? If you still want my opinion, brawlhalla is awesome. Its a 2D Brawler like Smash Bros and its appealing for occasional gamers and competitive monsters alike. The saying ""easy to learn, hard to master"" totally applies here and ranked mode can really get the best of you (if my broken mouse is reading this, i didnt mean to throw you against the wall).

64,Path of Exile,2018.0,"Whenever I decide to go back to Path of Exile, I remember the good old days when I didn't have any income whatsoever, but was just so excited by the thought of playing those few games I could! Path of Exile was one of those games. If my memory serves me correctly, I have upwards of 200 hours logged in this ARPG.  Each update added a new layer to the complexity of the game. For a new player, the complexity was something that initially pushed me away. Just take a moment to look up ""Path of Exile Passive Tree"" and you will get a good idea of what I mean. It is (or was) easy to make a character that had such poorly allocated stats that it was very difficult to progress. Perhaps that is (or was) a part of its charm. You have to figure out what skill gems, equipment, support gems, passive tree configurations, and (if you were so lucky as to get a relevant one) unique items would serve you best. Finally claiming success in beating all of the acts for the first time brought me a feeling that I would claim rivals beating a Dark Souls game for the first time. I have not caught up with the community, but in my experience, it can be quite toxic. I recommend trying it out with personal friends or alone, rather than a random party. That being said, it is absolutely viable to play on ones own, and that is was I did before I figured out how to properly navigate the initially confusing UI. Definitely need an open mind when trying this one out.",1
100,VEGA Conflict,2017.0,"I really enjoy the game, though it is mostly only fun for the first while.Pros:+Great sounds & graphics+Interesting mechanics+Large number of each type of equipment from ships to weapons to armours+PVE is very funCons:-Pay2Win-Long repair times for ships-Only one fleet can be repaired at a time-Long waiting times for simple things-Only one base module can be upgraded, modified, or used at a time (I.E. five days to upgrade the Fleet Bay, nothing else can be upgraded until it has completed)-PVP is basically just attacking down -- While there is a 5-level limit to attacking other players, it is fairly easy to create a decently powerful fleet at a low enough level to attach most any other player, whom then are unable to retaliate outside of immediate self-defence-PVP against bases mostly comes down out-ranging the enemy as much as possibleQuite fun, but as to be expected from a free to play mobile game, it only gets harder, slower, and less fun the longer one goes without spending money. However, despite this the game is still some fun and is worth checking out.If the repair times on damaged ships were less extreme, I would be much less reluctant to give VEGA Conflict a recommendation.",1

8886,Realm of the Mad God,2015.0,"Changed my mind this game sucks, Thumbs Down now. You can still read the review if you want.Alright so It looks like that i'm the only one here now with an insane amount of hours that still actually thinks this is a good game, not entirely ruined by the company. This is a game where if you play a lot you're going to be good. If you play a lot you're going to get good gear. It's not as if the company Kabam being greedy is taking the core away from the game, just because Kabam is a greedy company it shouldnt take away from the fact that you can still enjoy the game without paying a lot of money.If you come into a F2P game and expect to not spend any money then you were mistaken to even set foot in it in the first place because you all know as well as I do what the F2P business model is.There are a lot of things that which you must buy to fully enjoy the game for what it is, but like I said that should be expected for most F2P games today. You may need vault chests, which is 500 Gold each which equals 5USD. You may need a character slot, which the first few are cheap but the rest cost about 1000 gold, which equals 10USD. But you do not need to buy all of these seperartely, they do frequently release GOOD packs that allow you to actually save on some money if you wait for one of them, for example the play more pack can have 1 character slot 1 vault and 2 backpacks, which is a 2000 gold value for only 1000 gold.So if you decide you want to play this game then give it a shot but do not expect to not pay anything if you plan on playing it a lot.Now I will say that even I am not the happiest with Kabam, they're very sloppy, greedy, and slow with content. But that does not make this a bad game. I repeat for the 50th time that does not make this a bad game. I just makes a game that is ran by a bad company. Everyone here downvoting this game because of the company is just wrong because you cant judge the game itself like that, you're taking away from other people who may geniuenly enjoy this game for what it is, because you gave it a bad review when it doesnt deserve it. I am by no means a kabam fanboy. But I am a RotMG fan, and If you're looking to play this game then I do reccommend it.",0

6871,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewTL;DR: Another Veteran gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rambles on about the ""good ol' days"" of Robocraft, and won't be returning even IF they decide to roll back to one of their older versions.I have another ~200 or so hours on their launcher, as well as the 410 hours here, and have been playing on and off since it first appeared in Early Access. Meaning, I've played around when it was just wheels, hovers, and flyers. Not real sure if it was planes, choppers, or both, though.Thing is, I can remember a time when I first got my hovers and was excited about buzzing around the battlefield that way. However, if they weren't spaced out, you could find yourself floating upside down with an unprotected underside. This was all before the much needed flipping mechanism they installed, then revamped to four seconds instead of ten, as well as no training rooms or what not. Just simple TDM all day every day.Then the insect legs came out, and boy was everyone happy. So much so, there were many who completely failed, but was still fun. Not to mention the fun little designs people created with them. Spiderbots. Spiderbots everywhere. Sure, there was the odd scorpion thrown into the mix, but I remember more spiders than them.This was about the time I left for a few months, and came back to find MEGABOTS. Oh boy, what a train wreck that was when it started. The Megabots before the epic ♥♥♥♥ up with FJ were more artsy than naught, but you have to understand something. The art bots I very much enjoyed were VERY squishy. The reason why was very simple: Each block had different HP, with silver-blue and black-red/green being the highest, and white/glass being the lowest. Yes, glass cubes were easily bought back then, but would drop your framerate to Nil if blown up. Another way to drop the FPS was to attach your bot with as many flags as humanly possible. The more you have, the less amount of bots you'd see on the battlefield, because everyone with crappy computers were lagging real bad.That was a fun time, and I really do miss those days. What with grinding for TP (talent or technical points, not real sure which) to grab that much needed weapon, block, or what have you. Then grind for RP just so you can buy the much needed blocks to allow you into the next tier. That's right folks, I said TIER, and there were 10 of them, 11 with Megabots.Each tier had its own set of blocks needed for you to stay, or else you'll end up in the next one with crap guns, blocks, and armour. Not to mention the fact that if your pilot seat is exposed, and gets nicked by a small shot, you were dead and could only whine about it. There was no ""wait ten seconds to be instantly healed"", only you, in the middle of nowhere, waiting for death. Sure. There were healers around this time, but they were more focused on the Mega and not your sorry♥♥♥♥♥Then came the ""The Pit"", which was okay, I guess. Never really got into it, and still don't. Would rather work as a team, rather than duke it out with four to nine other bots. However, they had their own set of problems. Such as instantly healing after getting to the top of the board. There was an exploit in there, where a person was able to have a continuous heal added to their bots if they made it just right. I'm not one to say how, but they patched it out within a couple of months.Afterwards came ""Challenge Battle"", but I'm pretty sure its referred to as ""Battle Arena"". Again, it wasn't my thing, even though it gave everyone a chance at better tactics and strategies. Not to mention the increased revenue for completing such a thing, and the introduction to callouts on the minimap. This also came with a bug, more of an exploit really. Where one team with superior firepower would ""farm"" the other team for points whilst waiting at their base. They wouldn't touch the main crystal, and simply went for the people who spawned in. Pretty sure there's a comic about it floating around Reddit with this.Really, though, this was a fun time to play Robocraft, until the majour ♥♥♥♥up everyone knows about. Such as the removal of Tiers (BIG MISTAKE, FJ), removing the way people gained their blocks, modules, armour, etc, and shoving everyone into what they called ""Battle Ranking"". Went away for a month, came back, and found it to be horrid. Then again, I stuck around just to see what else they did.What did they bring? Why, new weapons, armour, and modules of course. not to mention the removal of Megabots. I love Megas, and had two; one SMG and one Plasma. I miss them both, but FJ doesn't want them, and if they say ""No"", there's not a DAMN we can do about it beyond writing these reviews.Folks, the thing is, I'm not going to recommend this game to ANYONE. If you want to try it out, go right on ahead. The game had its ups and downs, but now its just copying CS;GO and other first person shooters with their loot crates. Not to mention the fact that they've stopped talking to us over on Reddit after all this♥♥♥♥♥♥popped into existence. If they decided to roll back to their previous versions of the game, not many of us would look twice. They've ♥♥♥♥ed up real big this time.PS: At the time of this review, I've about three months of Premium left on my account.",0

15532,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI feel like someone has to eventually come up and justify for paladins. It hasn't been treated fairly enough imo.Most people think paladins as in like a f2p budgeted overwatch, but what I can tell ya its that if you really give it a try, you will know it ain't all true. Well personally I do play both and I would say I enjoy paladins a bit more latelyI played paladins for a bit when it first launched, tbh I didn't like it that much back then since it was full of bugs and lack of servers. But recently I gave it a try again and now I'm absolutely obsessed with it. (The fact that I bought the founder's pack...)I came back and I am really surprised by how much effort the developers are putting into the game. The game is now so much more optimized, haven't encounter any major bugs so far. Another aspect is the diversity and the amount of champions, they really amused me. If only they can balance out the champions a bit...All I can say it's I genuinely take joy in playing paladins, especially with friends. GIVE IT A TRY YA ALLP.S. Jenos is bae.....",1

This game is very much a work in progress and the developers are constantly improving the game which makes it fun to play.  With the game being a work in progress still you may find the odd bug from time to time.

Also If you would like to get started you should try out the Primal Burst pack and try Gem Knights. A event called tag duels is curently underway and should eventually become a permanent part of the game and will be added to pvp, right now they are testing it out with this event.

13235,Minion Masters,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI regret spending money on this. Somewhere in here is a fun game but it's seriously laking right now. Once you complete all the ""challenges"" there's no way to play against AI unless you do the challenges again. Playing against other players means that you either destroy them with superior deck construction or you get absolutely dominated by cards that you couldn't possibly afford yet. Y'know, unless you're like 90% of the people I've played against and have dumped $20-$40 into the game.I can count on one hand the number of games I've lost because of mistakes I've made. The rest are all because I was swarmed by max upgraded cards and high level minions that I will never be able to buy. I've spent 30+ hours trying every deck composition available to me and I still only win about 1 in evey 10 games.Then there's the power tokens. Every four power tokens is supposed to be a gauranteed rare. I always, ALWAYS get money. Never seen a legendary even once. They cost 2000 shards and you'll be lucky if you get 75 from a spin after about 5 or 6 games. But you go into matches and seen entire decks made of legendary cards that are upgraded to the max. Ask for help in chat and you get the ""Git gud"" speech from level 100 players. Did I mention you also get about half XP unless you buy, buy, buy? Yeah, no thanks.It's such a shame. The game could be so great but you just don't stand a chance unless you spend at least $40 on the game and I'm not spending it.

15637,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewA Developer from Artix Entertainment had requested reviews from players after only being in OPEN BETA for one hour which is a bit of a joke but I have enough to make a review so here it is.Quick Review for those with more time on your hands.Is it worth playing: Not really there are better games out there for free Unless you intend to play on tablet or androidHow would you rate it out of 10? : A solid 4 Its a game equivilant of Meh Would I recommend to others : Nope Id suggest playing Adventure Quest Worlds instead is it a lot better constructed considering it is a sider scrolling web based game.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The first and biggest issue is the fact that this game was originally aimed at PC players of AQWorlds as the next AQ game and yet they spent so much time making the controls work for mobile/tablet users that they have forgotten how make it interesting for PC players. Character Customization : It is pretty standard and not a lot of variations even with the added barber shop into the game so not alot to talk about there.The Pathing and quest system are a joke because as of right now after you finish the tutorial you and just smack bang in this town that you are expected to know the layout and locations of everything with just random NPCs offering you quests for NPCs that you cannot find by a tracker or even in the quest information. So you are literally screwed from the word *Go* and If you have no prior experience of the game YOU ARE SCREWED.Now onto Monsters : At the moment of writing this it is in Open beta so its to be expected that things need to be worked out, But currently I was dealing 1/5th of the damage I was being dealt by monsters of the same level as myself and for the sake of arguements I was a fully geared warrior  So it makes zero sense that I should be getting destroyed by one monster as the same level as me.Combat system: This is where I believe that Artix Entertainment has done quite well for themselves because the actual animations of the attacks are quite good so in that regards I commend them But due to the long drawn out animations it would seem that where I as the player would get one special move off the opposing monster/s will be able to get 2 or even 3 attacks off therefore rendering my damage pointless because they have caught up to my damage spike and even done some more which inturn requires me to demolish my supplies of potions that I have/had.UI/Menu : Again I honestly think Artix Entertainment has really done well on the UI and Menu system, For a phone or tablet game, There is no need to restrict PC users to such a simplistic and just empty screen and weirdly enough they have locked the chatbox to the topleft of the screen even though ther is nothing else on the bottom left, Which is another indication that they only thought about phone and tablet users.Sounds and Music : I think the Music is alright not the best but what the hell its better than nothing am i right ? but when looting or attacking it suddenly gets extremely loud and every time you loot a monster it is preset to make the sound of a chest opening when your opening a bag, Now thats just lazy because it doesnt take a lot of time to make 2 different sounds for different containers of items that monsters will drop. The attacking noises are extremely loud for really no reason in really random areas, Such as making that trademark *Sheen* Noise when it is swung but it is so loud if you really want to listen to it Id Highly recommend making the sound very low.",0

Then you've come to the right place, young Jedi.This game holds a great community that (surprisingly) passes as the best community experience I've seen in the last few years. Even though this game is free, for some reason, it doesn't attract 12 year olds such as some other games do..

Of course, there is - Pay 2 Advance Faster -, but it's totally up to you if you like the game, therefore you decide if you'd like to support the developers or not, with a little buck.I rate this game 8/10, because it could have been better.

17431,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewTL:DR - Get it if you have nothing better to play. Otherwise, move on.Back when i first started playing this, about 2 years ago, this game was actually pretty neat. It was 'Robocraft'. You build your bots, go into battle, get RP, buy more parts and improve your bot. You could go into a battle and see unique bots all over. Some sucked. Some were OP. Some were simply ridiculous.Fast forward to now. With the CRF introduced, it's not so much Robocraft as it is Robo'copy-n-paste'. I see one awesome design in one match. Cool. Next match i see a similar design but with rearranged electroplates. Then i see one with different weapons. Suffice to say, people aren't as encouraged to build their own bots as they were pre-CRF. Still not that bad. I mean, they can copy the bots but i'm still building mine from scratch.The addition of Flaks, and all updates henceforth, spelt the death of this game. Current state of the game? Build a tanky ground bot, or get rekt (buy big shotgun). Build a small and fast flyer that is capable of retreating easily, or get rekt (by big flak cannon). The number of 'viable' builds in the game has been greatly limited to giant ground tank, or small/fast flyer. No more flying tanks. No minimen. It's just, for lack of a better word, pathetic. Flaks just knock you down no matter how tanky your plane is. An easy fix for this would be if FreeJam did something sensible and, a) decreased flak firerate or b) decreased the damage. But it's FreeJam, when've they ever listened to player input? Thank god for FreeJam that the LOML (Lock-on Missile Launcher) isnt too bad after recent nerfs. Not even gonna get started on the shotgun.INB4 ""Make better bots you noob""Fair point. Maybe i should make better bots. Now i just need more cu-- NOPE. In order to get cubes/weapons/parts, i'll need to head into battle. In order to get good stuff i need to place high up. To place high up, i'll need... oh no... a better bot!!11!?!?!?1? See where i'm going? With the old RP system, I could've easily gone into battle, farmed cash, then bought whatever i needed at the time. Now i play with a sh17b07, get low rank, then get more sh17 to place on sh17b07. Oh how do i get out of this loop? :c. By spending cash on the stacks of protonium boxes obviously (which i'll note, does not guarantee at least one decent item).End of Review/Rant/Rantview - FreeJam needs help. Whatever they're trying, or tried, to make of this game is far out of sight, and can never be reached because they took the wrong train to crapland.",0
15425,Magic Duels,2016.0,"Note: I'm only commenting on the single player. I don't multiplay with strangers and none of my friends have this game.Background: I loved the Magic: Duels Of The Planeswalkers series that I had on the Xbox 360. I was hoping this would be more of the same. It isn't.In the previous DotP games, in single player mode you had some control over your deck. The starting card set was usually pretty weak, but you could unlock cards by playing and winning the single player games, so if you found you were getting stuck, you could go back to an easier encounter and grind out some better cards. You could also customize the deck (e.g. go heavy on direct damage and chump blockers to counter an enemy that likes to summon big creatures). None of that is possible here. In single player mode, you're stuck with whatever crappy deck the game gives you. No editing, and no way to grind out better cards. Using these subpar pre-made decks, you get to duel against the CPU which is wielding some of the greatest cheese this side of Wisconsin. Think the Elf deck from the original DotP. That level of cheese.Honestly, I don't understand why Wizards has made the single player mode such an exercise in frustration. It *is* possible to beat the incredibly slanted odds, but it's pretty clear pretty quick that it's all up to luck and not up to skill. Yes, single player does earn you a few of the in-game ""coins"", but if I was interested in farming coins, I would have played a random battle against the random CPU with the deck that you get from finishing the tutorial. I just wanted to get a chance to experience the game ""lore"", but it's not worth the aggravation.I'll probably keep the game around to play the random CPU battles when I feel like tinkering with a deck, but I doubt I'll ever bother finishing the rest of the story mode. And I'll certainly never give these bozos a nickle of my money. ",0
8103,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewBless Online is simply not ready for any type of release requiring money.  I've been playing MMO's since 1998 Ultima Online and participated in the launch of over 30 MMO's. Bless is easily one of the worst. Other games have had launch issues, yes, but at least there is usually a worthwhile game once you get all of the issues ironed out. From the graphics to the game optimization to the mechanics of the game, Bless is uninspired and feels cheap. Save your money and go play FFXIV if you are into PVE or any number of other polished MMO's if PvP is your thing. This game is worse than mediocre at both and the update/design decisions of the game proves that NEOWIZ has no idea what they are doing with this game.",0

401,Path of Exile,2016.0,"This game has led to alot of moments for me, alot of them being hilarious, whether that was me being a noob or not in the situation is a different story.  I still love playing this game for the fact that there is still a ton of stuff I have yet to try.  Some of my freinds have asked me advice and to be quite honest, even with 1000+ hours, I still feel like a major noob.  The biggest thing I mention is, try out the silliest thing you can think of, getting rid of tradtional thoughts about character steriotypes is important I feel.  I also love how with 1000 hours, the crafting system atleast for me has been always a touch out of my reach, for the challange leagues I mean.  Would deffinetly reccomend to arpg fans.Update:The game is headed in a new direction currently.  Mechanics are getting reworked, new systems are getting implemented, and theyre doing away with replaying the game 3 times over and adding one single playthrough.  I still reccomend the game, just thought I'd post an update that changes seem to be on the way, for better or worse.",1

Trust me... I've played plenty of the other trek games which have been very poorly implemented and are buggy... *cough* Star Trek: Armada *cough*To absolute trekkies, this game gives plenty of 'nods' to all of the series such as Planets, ship systems, characters, races and many more.To give a balanced view of the game, I must say that the lockbox side of the game isn't in the spirit of the trek universe but I understand that Cryptic have to make money to keep this game going to keep publishing new content and refreshing older content... if they don't, it'll go the way of WoW and become stagnant.",1

Of course, there is a bit of a learning curve which begins to ramp upward with each and every passing level until you finally hit the level cap. Despite the fact that this game might be a ripoff of those two well known franchises, the fact remains that this is one game that shouldn't be missed, whether you're a hardcore gamer looking to get away from WoW or you're a casual gamer and just want to run around like crazy looking for people to hang out with. If you like it, then by all means, keep playing.

The races can have free practise and qualifying sessions added before the race and these options are also available in multiplayer. The setup and configuration of the dedicated server is very easy. These cars, which in real races are millimetres apart and us being able to do the same whilst playing multiplayer is just awesome! Hats off for near flawless multiplayer code! The free cars you get are awesome to drive and shows that effort has been put into simulating the different behaviours of the cars. There are two racing circuits where one is a more open circuit similar to Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya and the other a more narrow circuit similar to Circuit Gilles Villeneuve Both circuits are great fun and there are milliseconds to be gained in and out of every corner!I've yet to try the ""Get real"" difficulty to have a look at the different setups of the cars, but I do hope there are some pre-sets to chose from. The Jeoff Crammond Grand Prix games didn't have and see where that lead them... There are however some problems with the game. The first thing is that their marketing plan is confusing to say the least, no need for me to dig deeper into it, read the  other reviews and read the guides for the game if you are to buy content.The actual tracks could simulate more realistic features like best grip in the race line, and I'd like to see different type of weather too, like rain for example. The leader board is a joke because the fastest laps on it are now impossible to beat as changes to the tracks have made some ""short cuts"" invalidating the lap. A reset of the leader boards should be done ASAP! Sector3 Studios are working continuously on the game and with that in mind and seeing the potential it'll bring RaceRoom Racing Experience very far!",0

6164,AdventureQuest 3D,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAlright, I know playing only 30 minutes worth of the game isn't exactly the best way to present my case, but there are things that are indeed kind of a gripe for me. Don't get me wrong, Adventure Quest was something of a lot of people's childhoods (Along with mine to a large extent) but the fact remains that there are some things that are kind of annoying.First off, there are WAY too many loading screens, seriously, if you thought Adventure Quest Worlds had a bad time with Loading screens... Oh boy, my friend, you're in for a shock. While it may be thanks to my bad internet, some of these loading screens can take thirty seconds to about two minutes. I don't get what was wrong with simply downloading the whole game, having the loading screens not require internet to go faster. (Yes I know the other games were like this, but it'd really save the hassle of sitting and waiting for the thing to load...)Now for the second, I think the dialog isn't all that bad, but the guardians seem... weak...I know that they're made to be protectors, but seriously, I've never seen guardians this weak since the days of the First Adventure Quest, I know this is looking into it a bit too much, but really? Getting their butts handed to them on a silver platter by a group of skeletons... At least in the first game, they actually did try to be somewhat strong, but still got defeated on a decent bases, I get that the main character (aka you) has always been the center of attention, but come on!Now for something good for once, I'm glad that they went back to the old Guardian system, where instead of paying a monthly fee, it's been reset back to the single payment it was back in the first game, which is a really neat thing. Sure there's still money that you need real dollars to by with, but thankfully guardian is one of those things that doesn't need a monthly payment. This is my two sense about it, I'll be honest, I'd be a bit harder on the game if it wasn't for the fact that it's been a part of most of my childhood. It's still a half decent game, and it's free for the most part, of course there's still all the microtransactions, but it's to be expected free games like this. I hope you enjoyed this review, even if it was a bit.. I don't know, half baked... Though I still say you should give it a try, it's one of those games you either do or do not like.",1

5155,Creativerse,2018.0,"The first thing probably on anyone's mind when seeing the screenshots of this game is 'a ripoff of Minecraft.' It can be considered that but with almost too many years of experience with Minecraft, Creativerse has a LOT of differences, it honestly feels a little like a different game. The graphics are amazing and the creatures roaming around are terrifying and adorable all at the same time! The gameplay is nothing like I've seen before with items such as the Extractor and a creative way of obtaining items without the use of a shovel, axe, or pickaxe. It can take some time to figure out what to do and go through God knows how many tasks. A huge setback for some peeps can be the fact that in order to experience even more the game, you have to pay around 19 bucks or so to upgrade to Creativerse-Pro.",1

There are also many glitches that I mentioned earlier and also those you can mess around with and try to find new glitches! and for the hacking part just do a 1v1 with hacks, like hacker versus hacker.

17669,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2014.0,"I tried almost every simulation outh there including iRacing , and i was excited for a new simbin title , cuz im a fan of simbim from way back with GT legends and GTR/GTR2 , so i was expecting a good sim, insted i got some Acrila cars that u can not get used to , just like iRacing , u cant feel the road , u can master a track but u cant master the grip, its just unconected... no way neer GTR ad GTlegends and Race07...i dont care  about graphics so thats my opinion on phisics and engine, a big fail from me , but i understand they wanna make it more fun and driver frendly but in there aprouch the have missed me .Now a little bit of a content rewievIts not a free game , its a demo, if u want a game with content u have to buy it and its not cheep, i hate it , its like Star citizen , selling u a model of something and pricing it not as much as star citizen but still, its a 3D model, and when 10 000 ppl buy it u end u with 50 000euros in cash, does it cost that much to designe a 3D model of a car, NO, so what is it , a rip off is what it is , they dont want to make a game, thats why u cant play it standalone with no internet conection, they wann sell stuff like Star citizen cuz they have seen the amoun of money SC earned robing off kids with money, Im OK with that , rip off all kids with money i couldnt care less, but u wont get it from me , i want a racing simulation , that will work even if my internet connection is down, i want to pay for a game not a car or a track. I couldnt care less what tracks name is , or what car am i driving , as long as its a nice track and a good car phisics ,so i play would play rFactor with unlicensed cars and track that work good rather then pay 200e for RaceRoom that has all licensed cars that u can not feal and have to pay for a door panel and tyers .. thats what it boilds down too, they would sell i virtual wheels and windshields if they could but they cant so they sell cars and tracks, im not in too that, so what are the alternativesAlternativesGSC as Game stock car 2013 is a better sim on every level, exept multipayer but that will improove when ppl realise that its the best sim on the market , apart from iRacing that so expensive u cant even consider it in a category of 20-30e and doesnt feel as good as GSCAlso Aseto corsa is better then Race room, and its cheeper , but its not finished So thats my review , boils down too if u have money there is no reason not to try to buy content, but if u suport financial models like that u will end up paying for wind shields ,rims and car skins, maybe even P2W like high octane fuel.If u are smart, u will suport games that dont try to get as much money from u but insted focuse on giving u a pleasure of racing against AI and ppl with as much content as u like , with mods, oficial content etc....so for me there is just GSC 2013 and Aseto Corsa that are on that level of racing, i Racing too but thats for profesional drivers not for a casual gamer..Race room expirience is a money generating machine not a racing simuator , just like World of Tanks is, Star Citisen and all other so called free games .

I spent a lot of time in this game, and I am only researching my first jet. The grind is real, repair costs are incredibly high for ARCADE which doesn't make sense because its ARCADE. I kinda understand them in Realistic. I hate the blatant russian bias. I think the game is overall a good game. I would continue to play it, but it is incredibly annoying when I have been stuck at 85k SL for the past few months. (Only cuz I play like once a month now, but thats only because of the raging repair costs). Match making is also an issue, the part I am angered about is how they put me in matches with a majority of jets while I still had Rank 4 propeller planes.

6409,Crush Crush,2017.0,"It was fun to try and help make this game into a reality before, back when it was just on Kong.  While the game is not perfect, it is quite a nice game overall.Let's go with positives.  It is a terrific time waster. There's definitely replay value.  The game has a similar feel to Huniepop, albeit mostly keeping PG or PG-13 oriented.  You can feel your progress increasing over time as you gain further and further into the game.   The amount of achievements is quite nice and feels a lot better to try and get overall.  There has been so much progress built up onto this game ever since it first came out a little over a year ago, and working with Sad and Oji and the main artist was also a nice touch.Now for the negatives. It does take a long while to get up to the end of the game, though that is expected.  The prices of the last couple of items are a bit stifling for those still early/middle of the game.  It can take a very long time trying to click through the game and idle playing is sort of diminished after the first couple of resets. Additionally, the Huniepop feel talked about before is almost too much like it.  The only thing really missing is the lewdness aspect and the Match 3 puzzle aspect that made Huniepop its own thing.  We traded action for Idle, and that's not really a bad thing overall, but it is noticeable.Overall, the game is a swell, free, Idle/Click mixture of another wonderful game that will hopefully still continue to update itself as time goes on. ...and hey, if they ever need help, always here to give it.",1

14034,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI paid about 100 USD and climbed to GOLD rank in two weeks, with the win rate of 70% or so, but decided to quit because the game play is not fun.Pros:It is fun to brew your own deck if you are rich enough to build sufficient card collections. The cards that utilize the void (used spells and dead creatures pool) and those that manipulate the deck (like warcry giving +1 +1 to the next card you draw) create a significantly greater space for deck varieties.Cons:The playing itself is very dull and RNG heavy and frustrating.If you don't draw the right combination of powers (mana) in the first few turns, you can't play any cards and just watch your opponent beat you up.If both players manage to draw the right powers, then the match is decided based on who got to draw more threats and answers. If the opponent plays Tavrod for 2 turns and you only have 1 removal, you lose.If the opponent is aggro and you don't have lightning storm (aoe removal) by turn 3, you lose.If the opponent is chalice (a weapon that buffs small creature and draw you card) and you can't burn him in the first few turns, you lose.If your deck is based on reanimating the void and the opponent just happens to play a ""Steward of the Past,"" which retroactively silences everything in your void on top of having a good stats on its own, you lose.At the mulligan phase, you have absolutely no information on what kind of deck the opponent is playing, so you just blindly mulligan for powers. In Hearthstone you know the opponent's class so you can make an educated guess as to what cards will be effective. In Eternal you never know if you should keep the Lightning Storm.Matches are very snow-bally, one sided and RNG. I feel whatever I do or the opponent does have no bearing on the outcome.  You can try and play for free.But be warned when you have enough cards to build an optimized deck, when your threats demand answers and you can include as many hard removals as the meta calls, then the game has become a dice roll.I will come back only if they change the power system.",0

14386,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game used to be fun.  Then OB64 happened.With the old 12-point loadout system, everyone was pretty much balanced.  The way it worked was each character had 20 regular cards and 3 legendaries, and you would make a loadout by selecting one legendary and five cards.  Legendary cards would significantly change one of your champion's abilities which would change your playstyle and the role your character could fill.  The other five cards would give further buffs to particular skills.  You could then distribute 12 points among your five cards, with a max of 4 points in any one card, to make that card stronger.  The nice thing about this system is that unlocking new cards didn't strictly make you more powerful, because the cards were pretty balanced.  It just allowed for a wider variety of play styles, which didn't give you a bigger advantage, it only made the game more fun.Now, we have Cards Unbound.  Everyone has every card unlocked at the start, but they're all at level 1.  To level them up, you have to find duplicates in loot boxes.  Gone are the days when everyone would have some strong cards and some weak ones, depending on how they spend their 12 points.  Now, whoever has the most money to spend on lootboxes to level up their cards is going to have the advantage, plain and simple.Just don't waste your time with this game.  I used to love it but it has since been uninstalled.",0

With numerous characters that fans of the series can relate to, all those familiar enemies and regular events that could see this competing with the already established games on the market.Some new players may find early game a little more difficult since the introduction of the Legends of Skyrim add-on as some of the cards require some balancing, however after you've collected a few of these cards you will notice the difference in the power of your deck.Obviously being a F2P you WILL encounter those pay to win players but that's just the way of the F2P business model! Again you can overcome this with a little dedication, which after a few hours clocked your can have a pretty powerful deck.TES: Legends also has a single player campaign for those of you who don't want to dive straight into the PVP elements of the game. This story mode is unfortuntley rather short and to be able to progress in the story you will need to buy the extra content, which again boosts your deck power but if you like the game as much as I do, you won't mind throwing a little money at the game!All in all I recommend this game as a suitable time sink especially for those who enjoy climbing the ranks in ranked plays and those who generally enjoy this genre, give it a bash and decide for yourself...TLDR: 7/10 - Pay to win decks put me off until I got powerful enough to kick♥♥♥♥♥on my own accord!",1

2501,Neverwinter,2015.0,Good game for people who like the locked on attacks and almost no dodge mechanic. Has a good story but it is wanting for some important quests instead of many mini quests. game can get boring because of the time it takes to level up when you get above lvl 25. PVP is ok but is super boring (fighting normal enemies makes my adrenaline pump mor than PVP.) all the classes seem to be balanced but in pvp the Ranger plays hide and go seek. This game is fun for those who like a bit of grind and large 13 v 1 boss battles.  TOTALY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!,1

9987,Black Squad,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewLet me just start off by saying that this game is one of my all-time favorite First Person Shooters on Steam. The gunplay is absolutely the greatest thing you'll ever experience, simply shooting an enemy is satisfying. The weapons are vast, and they give you enough free things to start with that you can get a few easily. The maps are large, with various designs to make sure the players are never bored, because there's always something new. Skins exist, but only add cosmetic value, and most of them look extra good. There's even a sandbox that lets you use an ingame stopwatch, spawn and delete enemies, and choose a map freely. There are cons (like microtransactions allowing people to get more guns) but as I said, you start with enough to choose your own gun for free.",1

Basically you hit autoduel and snooze to level up the characters.I was able to build a very competitive Sylvans deck as a new player, and I probably could hit max rank but got bored at platinum.The card gain system is very bad. You can't craft cards like in Hearthstone. You have to buy boosters from a pack so you could get very unlucky and need to buy 75% of a box just to get 3 copies of a rare. The cards you can get from pvp tickets and with gold are very limited and you cant build a tier 1 deck without buying boosters.",0

This game might appear to be one of those games that you play once and then forget about but if you actually give it a try it is ridiculously addictive. It is easy to pick up and heaps of fun to play with friends. Realm is a perma-death game with some things that carry over between lives. These things being a currency which is only earned when you die, your pets and any items that you leave in your vault. With a change of developers, lots of free stuff and new content coming in, NOW is the perfect time to start playing. With the new developers (DECA), we can expect frequently monthly updates and changes to the game keeping content and gameplay fresh.This game is one of my favourite games to play. My steam client says I have about 60 hours on the game but my main realm account runs on a different platform and that one would show you about 1000 hours.Honestly this game really deserves the recognition of the ""haunts my dreams"" steam award because it will encompass everything you think about in you dreaming and waking thoughts.",1

20402,Fractured Space,2016.0,"I've been playing this game since late alpha/early beta. I've been active in the community, lead events, and participated in competitions. Not just a paserby that didn't get interested in anything past playing on my own.I have a very serious question. Does ECG ever plan to advertise this game? To grow a player base? To reach out and seek an actual member-growing strategy? Skill brackets in PvPwere removed because the queue times to play PvP were ungodly and caused players to quit. Arguably the worst queue times most of us have ever experienced (often 45min for a game). Now, we are able to play games after probably an average of 10 minutes (those of us a little higher) which, while nice, has had huge reprocussions.Today I played aprox. 9 games where each, in a row, I was teamed with players with much lower rank than myself. For those of you wondering ""How could you know that"", I asked most, but you get to a point in this tiny community where you recognize just about every name that's near you in rank. One that I played with was apparently on his 2nd or 3rd match in PvP as a whole. Take 2 high rank players on one team... pair then with 3 incredibly low mmr players. Now pin them against 5 moderate rank players. Who will win? Experience always outweighs. But, according to the system, I should've won by a mile. Instead I lost 33mmr. Then 20mmr. Then 15mmr. Then another 20mmr (the average is 8-12 for balanced games). Game after game because ""I should win"" with green players on my side that unknowingly throw nearly every strategy. The fault isn't with these players - they're new. The fault is with this system and the development.Every update focuses on the flash of the game. Aesthetics, events, so on. When will the priority be to advertise? To fix the biggest issue the game has had since alpha? Two years is a long time. I've been here for what seems like ages; made some great friends and had a lot of laughs. But after today and after looking at the 'temporary fix' of removing brackets rather than facing the elephant-in-the-room-problem Fractured Space has had since Day 1 has made me finally decide that while this is fun to pick up occasionally and maybe play a game every week or so... it's just not worth it to try and help make a community active if the Developing team's priorities have never alligned with player base growth.Why would this be worth my energy if it's obviously not worth the devs' energy?It makes me sad. I want to love Fractured Space. But after two years of constant avoidance of the largest issue the game has ever had and no visible or obvious desire from ECG to attack it head on or even, God forbid, come up with a game plan for the future to solve it, you found a way to cover it up. No brackets. Both low and high players suffer so greatly from this. Games are only 'games' if they're fun. A blowout or a crush is neither. In fact, that's a great way to shove every player that's been playing for years away and have newcomers be completely disinterested.Don't worry, new skins are coming soon. You'll be able to show them off to the flashy AI players they'll soon be putting into PvP.",0
11924,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI've played many CCGs, including Magic (I'm currently in the beta for Arena), Hearthstone, Spellweaver, and Shadowverse. I've been playing Eternal for about 2 months now and I can honestly say that of all the CCGs I've played, Eternal is my favourite. It takes elements from many of these other games and improves on them. It has the complexity of Magic (without the finicky stop points and minutiae) and the fast pace of Hearthstone (without the RNG and over-simplicity). Since I found Eternal, I've hardly logged into Magic Arena beta because Eternal is a lot more fun. The mechanics are original and creative, allowing for meaningful decisions that affect the outcome of the game. Progression is well-paced (even though I've spent some money on the game, I don't get everything handed to me and have to work towards a bigger collection by completing quests and earning daily rewards). Lots of different game modes, both PvP and PvE means there's something for everyone (and every mood). The meta is also very healthy. Don't listen to the negative reviews complaining about the state of the meta a week or two after a new set release - they simply haven't figured out how to counter some of the strategies being played, which is what CCGs are all about! The Eternal meta is way more diverse and healthy than the other CCGs I mentioned above - there are 6+ viable top tier decks at any given time, and some of these don't require any legendary cards (see the recent ETS tournament results for proof of this). The community is great too - lots of helpful friendly people on the sub-Reddit. I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy the fun and strategy of CCGs.",1

2647,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2018.0,"I played this game quite a bit back in 2017 on the phone. I have enough hours for this game to properly review it.Duel Links is Meh. If you're a fan of Yugi-oh, I'd give it shot. The card battles are short and the music / voice acting are top notch. My issue is that it's tedious, requiring constant check ups to gain exp and money to buy cards by battling NPCs. The double edged feature they included was an auto feature that played for you. While a cool idea and allows you to quickly take out NPCs, the game turns into an idle game. Another card game, Hearthstone, makes you fight NPC's and then throws you into the fray against enemy players to gain more exp. The reason I'm bringing this up is because in Hearthstone, the fights are rewarding when you win against an enemy player. I wish there was an option to fight harder NPCs from the get go as the ranked play in this game is full of salt. Most fights have revolved around having certain cards with giant effects. I remember one match where the dude already had three monsters out on the second turn and one of them could negate set trap cards and spell cards. I could not find the motivation to continue learning about all the cards the game offers.This game does have a few interesting mechanics. When opening cards, you can go through an entire box and get all the cards as long as you dont reset the box. If you pay a fixed price, you can get all the cards in the box or go at it one pack at a time and still gain the cards. I recommend not reseting the box as it will mess up your chances. You can also buy prebuilt decks to use. The game also has a small pool of cards taken from each gen of yugioh. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like Monster reborn or exodia, so the developers do consider balance in some way. There are multiple characters with different abilities to chose from which allows for a variety of benefits with your characters and cards. My issue is that there is too many cards. As of writing, there are more than ten boxes to go through and all of the cards are usable in ranked play so you do not know what to expect when jumping in a match.I also had my account deleted when I had this on my phone, I had pegasus and quite a good amount of cards to play with.What I liked: Voice acting, Music, and quick battles.What I didn't like: Auto feature, Energy system, tons of cards, no locked meta.",0

772,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Great game that has a few fps issues (I have a weak build, I fixed fps using -dx11), trading limitations, and dungeon limitations. But, aside from all that it's still fun to play. Don't let all these negative ""p2w"" reviews get to you. The token aspect mostly only opens up more freedom in trading, market, and attribute training speed and does not give extreme unfair ""payed"" for advantages. I've felt the grinding aspect of the game a few times, but it was only because I didn't know how to explore the map well to farm all quests from both Klaipeda and Orsha sides (Those are the two starting points in the game with seperate main quests). The class system is really diverse, but strict at the same time so just make sure not to f**k up your class advancements (do research ahead of time). The game is still very addicting and fun to play with friends. Trading and market needs work and will hopefully get fixed over time. Game is still a great 9/10 and with improvements has the potential to be 10/10.",1
7946,Star Trek Online,2013.0,"Didn't try it out at release due to all the bad reviews, but gave it a go recently at a friends urging, and also since it's gone free-to-play so what's to lose.  Been happily surprised at how much fun I'm having.  It's certainly much improved over it's release condition and definitely a must play, if you're a Star Trek Fanboy, which I am.",1
20073,Neverwinter,2014.0,"I definitely recommend Neverwinter if you are a fan of D&D and MMOs. Pros:+ Combat - Easily one of the best features of this game. For me it was hard to play the traditional MMOs again as they suddenly felt slower paced. + Fast leveling - You can get to max level (70) fairly quickly as compared to other MMOs. Also, they recently reduced the post 70 ""overflow level XP"" requirement from 1.875 million down to a mere 100K XP. This lets you build up the power points quicker.+ VIP sub - I list the subscription as a pro because you actually get a fair value for your money. In addition to 12 tiered VIP level benefits, you also get a daily lockbox key (one per account) and Epic Dungeon key (per character). You don't have to open the loot packs that you occasionally get from the lockboxes. You can actually sell them for a pretty good price for AD. There are ways to reduce the cost of a sub even further if you time Zen sales and use coupons.  + Easy LFG/Dungeon/Skirmish finder - It's very easy to hop right into group action whether you queue or just watch the LFG chat.+ Guilds (strongholds) - You can get some serious stat buffs in the form of boons from a high level guild. Find one.+ End game campaigns - Again, good stat buffs with multiple boons available per campaign.Cons:- Not open world - The areas are big and look great but it's a hub style MMO where you are HQ'd in Protector's Enclave and can fast travel to other areas.- Multiple in game currencies - You are starting to see this more and more and Neverwinter wasn't the first or last to do it. You have Gold, Astral Diamonds and Zen to juggle in game.",1

1704,Magic Duels,2016.0,"Oh my god this is like poison. I played this game for free and I still feel ripped off. If you want to play a card game online for free, there are tons of free Yu-Gi-Oh card games online. But I hear already, 'This is Magic, not Yu-Gi-Oh, Yu-Gi-Oh sucks, Magic is better blah blahgblahbshas' That doesn't matter, what matters is that any of those free games have Thousands of cards to choose from, and this pitiful piece of trash has cards from two sets. Those other games also give you all the cards, so you can just play. I hear more complaints, 'But I want to get the cards, I don't want them handed to me at the begining, that way is for cheaters.' Yeah, but at least it starts you with something! The starting cards in this game are a joke, and you cannot build a half decent deck out of them. Whatever you do build, will be on par or worse than the easy level ai, and with how you get cards (with coins, 6 or 8 at a time) and how you get coins (by winning, 10 at a time) you have to grind the easy bot before you can get the cards that synergize with each other enough to go onto the medium bot, so you can grind faster.This wouldn't be too bad, maybe if the game wasn't so clunky and slow. Activating instants during the blocking phase is a chore, and during the damage step, physically impossible. Enevitabilities that you could just get over with quickly take what feel like eons when you have no cards to play and have to wait 20 seconds each turn to play a land and do nothing, while the opponent has a creature and is swinging at you for 2 until you die.Trying to retaliate with instants that require timing is next to impossible, and the way the game sometimes auto taps lands can really screw over a plan, especially when the system to choose which lands to tap (in the rare times it does that) has no explination on how it works and results in pressing every button on the keyboard until it taps the lands that don't screw you over. The quests can give you an extra couple of coins, but its still a tedious grind to open random cards that may or may not help make a deck that synergizes better than ""this creature gets +1/+1 if you have an island.""No good cards to use at the start.Boring grind to get cards that don't suck like a lung.Clunky and slow gameplay with various greivences.Don't touch this game.Edit: I forgot how awful the sound is in this game, but I have to mute my computer every time I play and when I went to go play something else it reminded me why after I unmuted it, everyone was still talking pretty quitely.And why is it that when the enemy quits, AI takes over for them! I play one game against a real person, and they leave so the AI can summon a 6/6 five drop and a planeswalker after practically boardwiping me.Which makes me wonder about the matchmaking, since every single one of their cards wass foiled, they had a lot of cards I hadn't seen, and a freaking plainswalker, and I have jack crap in my entire collection. Bad matchmaking! What can they mess up next?!?!",0

15578,Realm of the Mad God,2014.0,"Okay, so some people hate this game, some love it, so here are my thoughts. The unique gameplay and artstyle/character design is what truly holds this game together, otherwise the advertising spamming, insane micro-transactions, and on-and-off lag would ruin it all. So as you've probably figured out, this is a top down shooter, which as far as I know is pretty unique for a fantasy MMO. This game is quite challenging, it is a permadeath type game so if you die you must pick a new character and start completely over, on the other hand it isn't terribly challenging as long as you play it smart, there is also a hotkey command to bring you back to the safezone. The Perma-death can really turn you off, especially if you have good items and was close to reaching level 20, reaching level 20 will unlock a new character class or two, which is pretty much what keeps you playing. This game also has a massive amount of enemies for you to fight, many with different abilties, which is also what makes this game unique. I'd recommend everyone at least try this game, you may hate it, you may like it, and let me just say I don't play this excessively, its just something fun to play here and there. also its a very tiny download and takes a few seconds, its worth a try.",1
1460,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"Fallout Shelter is your usual idle mobile game with a bit of simulation and some clicking. Made by Bethesda and Behaviour Entertainment, released first in 2015 on iOS and other mobile, updated significantly since then, arrived to PC in 2016 and to Steam in 2017.Technically, it does have occasional glitch fixed by restarting game, such as when I couldn't remove elevator. And people say that they had their saves wiped out due to error or crash many hours later. So uncool.And eh, idle games are idle games. As far as I care, they are soulless. Well, though this game has a bit of soul, in artstyle. It's really neat in-universe-cartoon thing. Quite nice, mhm. None the less, the one who wins at these games is not the player who fully maxes it out after 100 hours. Nope, that one loses. The player who wins is the one who checks it out and goes away once it gets shallow.None the less, I tried. The normal play. There is your base building and basic recource management. Wait long time to get smthing. Can rush, with percentage that it can go wrong. The only microtransactions are either boxes of random stuff that you can get as loot anyway and ability to arrive to quests immeditly, doesn't matter much. Usually you can leave the game for a while unless you sent dwellers out exploring, then it goes against whole idle thing with them possibly dieing out of injury while you aren't paying attention.I mean, it's not Pay-2-Win but it's still an idle game which is completely shameful on PC.It's actually funny how game was different combat systems in shelter and quests. In shelter animation matter zero, everybody's health is just getting slowly sapped by presence of NPCs with their stats and only Endurance stat matters for health. Quest kinda does it more with aiming, attacks, critical hits minigames at rare times. But eh, still shallow.And yea, it's idle. I played normal vault for a while and stopped very quickly after realizing at how easy it will be. So I tried survival instead. And boy, instead of proper challenge I got cheese-land of cheesy tactics. It's hard but in merely annoying way, not the way that makes you think or tests you.Here are some examples of these pro tactics that are based off real life:Nothing bad ever happens if you don't pay attention to things. In survival mode you will be bombared with incidents every few minutes which will be sapping away health of your dwellers so in nutshell you want to do stuff and leave ASAP. Leave workers to live happily and restore health, for we all know that presence of exploitative class brings only unhappyness and bad luck.Just like in real life the best way to handle conflicts is just run away and ignore it. Right? So if you ever get incidents, in order not to get health of dwellers sapped away, you just have to move them away from whatever or whoever is invading you. If it's internal then it will spread to horizontal and vertical rooms and then end. Which also brings the only non-cheesy tactics of how to build base, aha. And if it's from outside then they just go through each row back and forth to the bottom and then go away. Just send dwellers to rooms where they already passed. It doesn't even matter if they have to go through fire on the way, it only takes away health if they are assigned to same room. Raiders also sap away recources while in shelter but in early game it's quicker to just let them run through than confort, thus takes less recources.Did you know that pregnant women are the best workers? While they can't fight back or do quests or explore, their AI is set to always run from incidents, practically making them completely invincible. And you wait forever about bringing babies out of their bellies. What an utopia.It also seems that if you have too much population then their odor will spread all over the wastelands, bringing bigger threat in. As a result you will have to stop at certain population and then wait patiently as you grab the needed loot. Send people on quests and exploration to gain better equipment before getting bigger. Idling. Don't upgrade to level 3 rooms early either, makes bigger internal incidents there.Overall, I quickly realized that in order to progress in Survival I will have to wait for days to get better equipment and once I got into the fairly stable movement in the game I figured that this mobile idle game can't provide any more proper enjoyment and left the game.I've won.",0
18345,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe respawn system delays the gameplay for so long because you spend ages running toward the objective to be immediatly kill by someone camping the objective in an awkward spot to kill, and if you're a newcomer you don't have any weapons to combat this so the game becomes a running simulator, plus the gunplay isn't anything special, feels kinda clunky",0
13129,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,"Uh... kind of surprised at the flak this game is getting. I've played the non-Blitz version before and it is a bit better with richer tank team progression and tech trees and such, more vehicle types too. But this is a free-to-play version that works with mobile interface, and I find that pretty exciting and well-executed. I get an almost identical immersion experience as the original version and it's not graphically- or gameplay-inferior. There are a few extra indicator arrows and things that would be absolutely necessary on a mobile device but don't detract from a PC experience, so I don't understand the whining. If the orginal version of the game was a first-class ticket, then Blitz is business-class as opposed to coach. The free-to-play and pay-to-gain elements aren't disruptive or exclusive, this is a well-put-together product for a wider audience of tank-battlers. No need for the high horse.",1
8238,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,"This a very entertaining game that allows you to battle with friends, or just anyone, by choosing one of nine classes that each has their own pros and cons. You will either be on team blue or team red. Obviously, the teams are against eachother and you want to battle the opposing colour. There are a variety of game modes to choose from where you must beat the other team. You can trade items, and there is even a whole currency for this game that is used in trading, or when identifying the price of your specified item. Overall I think this game is great. I highly recommend it for people who love action filled games, and who love to learn new skills. I recommend helping your team out if you would like to win, and don't leave them behind. Team Fortress 2 is a great game, but is better accomplished as a team rather than a singular person.

11420,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI've never reviewed anything before, but i'm pretty sure i can do a better job than Peon on this one, so bear(beer, cheers) with me.Let's start with the actual flaws-Localisation is bad. Not terribly bad, but it sometimes makes you think for longer when reading description of a skill. If the game is released for a western audience, this should've been done better-Default config is not optimised. There's an easy fix to get decent fps on reddit, but the idea that you need to do that and it's not done by default isnt pleasing-Overly agressive profanity filter. I wanted to name my guild Beavers. I couldnt. Beaver is bad word. Dont let your kids call anyone a beaver.3v3 seems fair, so here's 3 pro's aswell+Management - Hats off to Neowiz for dealing with community these last two days. It was a rough launch, but they stayed on top of things and everything is just getting better. More servers, no queues. Splash screen bug has been fixed, with class balance patch and various quality of life improvements coming in shorty.+Mechanics - Overwhelming at first, you discover how much there is to do. Of course you can join the hate bandwagon, spam dungeon till 45 and cry there's no endgame while you've just barely scratched the suface of the possibilities of this game.+Visuals - Game looks awesome both in combat and environment wise. Nothing seems forced or out of place. Naturally there are frame drops in the most populated spots, but lets be real, which game doesnt. Most of the haters who bash fps rates in the cities, ♥♥♥♥ themselves while getting 20fps in pubg lobby.Overall, yes there are flaws, but it's early days. And i would definitely not be the one to try to my youtube subscribers about lack of endgame if i had just reached lvl 33 out of 45. But hey, bandwagoning on the hate train is fine.TL;DR - My suggestion is give this game a try. Maybe not now, if you dont feel safe. It's still first days of the launch, it can be bad at times. But the games has what it takes to become one of the bigges mmo's out there. Either get it now, or wait - it's up to you.Peace.",1

It may have changed with future updates.",1
8883,SMITE®,2017.0,"After trying LoL and Dota 2... I can say without a doubt that Smite is one of the best MOBA's out there.The community is actually healthier than LoL's by a huge margin, but at the end, this is the lesser issue with these types of games, and it will greatly depend on luck and your own personality.The Devs are always worried about balance between the Gods that are old or new, the items that are used in the builds and even little details in the map designs or events. So if you worry about a broken game that barely gets attention on these issues, worry not, they take care of it with constant patches that are always mixed with new events, offers, cosmetics and so on.Despite certain small issues with old computers (Some perform poorly in specific game modes) This game is pure gold. I really recommend it, specially if you have people to party with you during the events that are often and are great. Also, if you are the kind of guy or gal that wants to spend a little bit of your hard earned (IRL) money they always have good offers and discounts during the year.This might sound weird. But the only thing that Smite is missing is the ability to trade Skins, Emotes, or other cosmetic elements of the game between players.I truly hope you enjoy the game as much as i have, i also hope you can refer your friends so you can enjoy even more with them.Word of advice: If you have the chance, get the God Pack when its in discount.

To increase resources, money and loot, you can outfit a group of heroes and send them off on quests for you. This is a nice addition and adds more to building up your business and city.The bad in this game, like any free to plays, the grind.

You can invite people to open shops in your own city. This lets them invest in (level up) parts of your city, benefiting all.

17544,Fractured Space,2017.0,"A decent to good game ruined by some annoying mechanics and a small, rather hostile, playerbase with limited variety.Good:Gameplay (overall) is really good. The ships are slow and require some patience. They are supposed to be big hulking capital ships. The combat is pretty good as well. Bad:Variety. 2 modes, conquest and frontline. Conquest has 2 lanes towards the enemy base with a middle lane for a bonus fight every few minutes. Frontline is... basically the same thing, but with only one lane and no middle bonus fight mechanic. So, you have 2 modes that both have the same/similar mechanics and objectives. If you don't like one mode, you won't like the other. Ships (stealth). Some ships have stealth, which, in and of itself, isn't a ""bad"" thing. The problem is that they drag the game down and are just unfun to play against. Games like Dota2 do ""stealth"" right, where you have some heroes who counter stealth in and of themselves (which this game has) but they also have items you can buy and deploy to reveal those heroes (which this game doesn't have). So, if the enemy team drafts a team (you can't switch ships mid match and you can't see what the enemy is bringing) and you don't have one of the few ships that have a reveal skill, you are SoL. Double (or tripple) the frustration when compared to Dota2 because you also have a 3 dimensional space your stealthed enemy could be. It's just not a good game setup as it has locked in ships where you can't see the enemy's draft but no option to counter if you don't draft one of those few counter ships yourself. Sound. Game audio is mediocre. Ship fire sounds rather lackluster. Playerbase. It's no secret that the game suffers from a lack of players. The problem is that in the few recent pvp matches I've played, people are rather hostile. That might not be an issue if the game had a decent playerbase, but if you run into someone you don't like, be prepared to see them in the next 20 matches because odds are you'll fight them again and again. Beyond that, finding a match, for me, has taken everything between 1 minute and 10. Grind. Unlocking ships doesn't seem so ""bad"" but I also bought into the game's early access and so had a lot of credits stored up. However, ships range between 300k credits and ~1mil credits while you earn about 10-15k each match. It just feels like too much of a grind for me, and that's before you buy the sidegrades for the weapons and abilities the ship might have. Menu. OMG I HATE THE MENU SYSTEM IN HERE!!!! Such a pain to visit the ""hanger"" and find a ship as you have to scroll through a small little menu window to find it. There are some filters, but they don't help as much as you'd think. Overall, the menues are all convoluted and fill up way too much of the screen offering too little information and still managing to feel overwhelming.Overall, the gameplay is good, but it feels like half a game with some rather unfortunate design decisions.

181,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"I'm no aficionado when it comes to these types of card games, but I'll give my 2 cents anyways, because I enjoyed this game, at first. I can't really compare it to other games since I lack experience with those, but I can at least give my little experience here.The biggest part that I love about this game is how so many cards can play off one another and stack up to a massive army all to be toppled in an instant when the one card it's all built upon is destroyed. A game can fluctuate immensely and it always has me on my guard or looking for a way to knock everything over with a well timed attack.The card variety is much larger than I expected when I started and I only got a real idea of how much there was when I looked to my stats and saw how low my % of each level card I had.The downsides I've run into are as follows;1: You can buy packs with real money and that always leads to ""pay to win"" mentalities in alot of players. Sure there are ways to get packs without paying, but using real money gets you much more much quicker. Then there's the ""RNG"" that tells you what you get. I use the  "" "" because after opening all of my packs for nothing but duplicates of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't help but assume it is predetermined what I get and I just have to grin and bare. My money says it's to try and choke money out of you.2: I ran into this glitch that skipped a large chunk of my turn. After ending one turn, my opponent did all they could and for some reason, it never said it was my turn again. It just became my turn again without any indication. I was able to play cards when I noticed it was my turn with my hand shimmering with what I could play, but I couldn't attack. It wasn't for lack of time, it's just that none of my cards were available to attack. I looked over everything played and in discard to see if I was mass shackled somehow, but that wasn't it. Either I ran into a cheater or a bug. On the bright side though, it only happened once.3: This is the biggest one and it's what makes me consider this game an abomination. Through the game stacking my deck in every match I have, I am completely unable to play. No matter what I put into my decks, I'm always given the highest cards I have first and even when I re-draw, I get them again. I've tried making low level decks so I can play at all, but then I will never draw a creature card, only equipment. I dwindle down my deck more and I'm left with not enough cards to even make a deck because the packs I've gotten give me either more equipment or things far too strong to play early on. Normally I'd chalk this up to bad luck, but when the same exact cards come up time and time and time again endlessly, the odds start to change. At this point it should be near impossible for me to not get something usable, but the game finds a way.In short, if you want to even be able to play whatsoever, you have to fork over your life savings. I get that devs need to make money, fair enough. But why not charge a small fee for the game? There are plenty of people willing to buy the game. I'm sure even more people would want to play if it was FAIR!By the way, if someone can tell me about that quick chat thing, I'd appreciate it. I've looked all over but the keywords bring up unrelated stuff each time in searches and i can't find anything in the game itself telling me what to press. It's like a closely guarded secret and I've been banging my head on my keyboard to find out how to do it.",0

1512,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewNot bad for a free game, but it installs 3rd party software (Gaijin Agent) that by default automatically checks for updates.  It kicked me out of a different game when it unexpectedly launched on its own, and it doesn't get removed if you uninstall the game.  In fact, it doesn't even have an uninstaller, nor does it show up on the list of programs for windows to remove.  You have to manually search for the file location and delete it.  Mine was under the App Data of my windows profile.  That just seems suspicious to me, so the publisher is either up to no good or they're not very bright..",0
7268,Shakes and Fidget,2018.0,This game is alright. While it is a free to play game the only way to gain much needed experence and money for the game is to invest real money into it. If you do get lucky and get items that will help you progress daily they are rare. Other then that so fsr for my few hrs of playing it has been fun and a challange to get the required items to make my guy the best he can while getting loot at the same time. I think that is why i will play this game untill the wheels fall off the chalange of getting the best gear as cheaply and quickly as i can. I would like to see more then just one world however the one it is alwas putting me in has been going up and down all day long.,1

So sadly, i dont see any competitive nature in the future of this game, this is something i would honestly play with some buddys to just mess around inEDIT: After playing a bit more with friends, its for sure something that is different, and takes some time to get used to, the aim may seem a bit off at first, once you really customize it, it will feel better.

1880,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"I grabbed this game for two reasons: 1. Elder Scrolls Obssession2. It Was FreeI was very pleased to find a game that, so far, I haven't had to spend money on to be able to play. You can purchase booster packs with in-game currency.  The game itself is simple and elegant. Pick two colors to base your deck on and go to town. The single player tutorial/story mode is pretty good and so far the people I've come up against have been good sports, win or lose.The Prophecy mechanics are really wha separate this game from other TCGs.  you have 30 life.  For every 5 life you lose, you draw one of your rune cards.  These are random cards from your deck.  If a rune card has the keyword prophecy, it plays for free.  I haven won (and lost) several games that seemed certain to be about over based on someone's drawing of a prophecy card.Overall, I'd say 9/10.",1

And nearly 6 years on, no other game can handle a large combined arms battle as well as Planetside 2. Moreover it runs very nicely on modern gaming rigs. Revisiting Planetside 2 recently, it has aged very well.The game is tough and grinding out progress will give you a small edge but it is ultimately a skill based game. I'm pretty sure a skillful battlerank 4 player will consistently beat a not very good battlerank 60 player for example. That being said, I appreciate that it could be a hard game for newcomers to get into and while it may not be for everyone, it's definately worth a try and persevering a bit.",1
16914,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2014.0,"~This is going to be a rather long review, please take a couple minutes and read through it if you're considering playing Lord of the Rings Online. :3Many people have said that this game is 'dying' and that has either scared people away from even starting to play, or pushing away old players who wish to play again. ~I am here to say that this game is NOT dying, NOT on it's last leg, or anything of the sort! The only reason that people from Steam say that is because Steam only shows people who are playing Lotro through Steam, but this amazing game was available, still is available to download through their website. This game has a flourishing community, many helpful people that would happily start playing with you, but only if YOU give this game a chance.In this next section, I will review what I think are the Pro's and Con's of this game. Pro's:~Many friendly people who absolutely love to play together, just waiting for you.~Flourishing community to answer all your questions and comments.~Fun and engaging content to keep you hooked for hours.~Simple crafting to gear your leveling character.~Many different classes to choose from to fit your playstyle.~Dungeons just waiting for you and your friends to plunder them.~The best gear in the game is crafted by players, not bought from a cash shop.Con's:~Many servers have a decline in population. (To move to Brandywine.)~Over-Simplified crafting.~Lag spikes in highly populated area's (As expected.)~Longer-than-usual server downtimes for simple repairs and maintenence.~Many things are still bought from the cash shop. (Personal Con.)~No real end-game (Yet, but plenty of gearing and skill tweaking to do.)You may notice that I have crafting in both Pro's and Con's, mainly because in the last massive update they (Turbine) made crafting super easy, but still fun for the leveling character.If you have read the review and agree, or disagree with what I have said about this magnificent game, go ahead and send a friend request and we can talk it over. ~If you're a new player, or a returning player who found my review helpful, you can find me on the Brandywine server, or even better, just send a friend request here. :D Always happy to help and chat. :3 ",1

There should also be missions to kill eniemies or other people also the multiplayer world should be much bigger because when I first started ""trove"" which I don't play anymore I killed like one enemie I was confused what I did after that because there was no more islands to go to or anything so that is why dont recommend this game!",0
15145,Magic Duels,2015.0,"After some time waiting for a fix, the game finally works on my primary PC:It is quite grindy, as you need to put in lots of effort to unlock cards. Overall gameplay is quite fun and addicting, but there is not that much to do except random battles against the AI or competetive multiplayer. I like the Campaign alot and it is quite challenging (because you have to make do with horribly bad decks), but also kinda short and offers no replay value/rewards.I can recommend the game to players that simply want to play some games of magic and have fun. Sadly, because of the very limited card-base, game mechanics and content, there is not much possibility for fun decks and long-term fun. There is alot of possibility for Magic Duels though, should it get updated with new content as the physical MTG progresses.Old Release-Review:Not working at all.

380,War Thunder,2016.0,"This review is written during the introduction of the British tank line.I played this game during the sale of a package for 30$, it includes 3 months of premium time and crate load of premium currency. During 3 months of premium:-Fast progression through the tech tree but not blazingly fast that skill was inadequate for the next tier battle.-Small annoyance like clearly mandatory module was easily obtain.-Credit flows nicely.-Able to team up with 2+ players rather than 1.After premium: [mostly ground battle]-Progression slow down to a crawl.-In ground battle where repair tools and fire extinguisher is apparently lock behind unlock wall, so if you’re tracked or on fire during a match you are SOL.-During my play, there is an exploit where user can turn down graphic to hide away all the foliage, other play that play at high setting like myself is at a disadvantage.-After unlocking tier 2, understand that you will fight against tier 3 tanks which clearly outclass the previous tier.Overall game:-Minimap is hard to read for first time, it’s too complex to read at a glance.-Some texts do not stand out to alert the player of what is happening to their vehicles.-Battle tier [arcade] is ridiculous, how can a stock tank at tier 2 fight with any competence against a tier 3.-The grind is real, imagine Korean mmo grind real.-All tanks are not made equal, so your duel is already decided on who got the jump+rng favor first. Yes, rng is a factor in this game where a shell traveling through the tank, shattered, minor injury only. Unless you're on the receiving end, all hell broke lose.Addendum: The beginning british tank are pathetic.

4915,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewLoading screen simulator teamed up with queueing simulator and decided to hire that one guy from babelfish too. You have become 10 level!On a more serious note if you thought Revelation online had poor localization this game asks you to hold its beer. Spending a vast majority of the time trying to even get the game to even run past the splash screen, then trying to actually get into the game, THEN fighting past the performance issues...you may eventually end up being just as confused as me when you even attempt to read your skill descriptions. When you end up playing a game and just pushing buttons to see what happens, not even wanting to look at your skill tooltips in order to avoid being even more confused than before, you kind of know something is wrong. I'd wager the English patch for the Japanese version is more localized than this hot mess.Edit for clarity: I put in for a refund.

The only good thing about this game was playing it with a few friends, but if you don't have anyone to play it with avoid. Dota 2 is one of those games that takes a lot of time to get even moderately ok at, time that could be spent playing something else more rewarding. It's still a good game don't get me wrong, it's just playing it on your own is too much of a chore for me. At this point I probably won't pick it up ever again.

It can be played casually if you don’t have a lot of time at first, but once you get far enough and unlock everything, you’ll have to pay closer attention to it. There are lots of players, so PvP-oriented players that can overlook the lack of control in fights might enjoy it. Overall, it’s an old game that has received some updates and still holds itself pretty decently for what it has to offer.

7923,Creativerse,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewCreativerse effectively takes everything I didn't like about Minecraft and fixes it. The inventory is better, the crafting is better, containers are handled better, there's a greater variety of enemies. Even things like the look of the characters and environment. Multiplayer is very easy to do, and you can make your world public or put on a password so only your friends can join.Don't let the ""pro"" status or microtransactions turn you off.

About 80% (maybe more) of my games I played with Russians was pure cancer. They didn't speak English, just &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥"" and other sh*ts.  This also applies with kids - I don't know, how many times I heard 11/12 yo kids who f*cked my mother, funny :), isn't it? You can have a good score, like 36/15, you can win 9 rounds on harder side, you can sacrifice your soul to win, but still, with team score 14/9 on better side you can LOSE. Why, because they aren't able to do something good. Situations, when they want to kick you:They want to kick you, if you don't clutch 1v5.They want to kick you, if you don't speak their language.They want to kick you, if you are 30 seconds AFK. They want to kick you, if you are ahead of them.They want to kick you, if you are behind them. ( mostly if  they use only P90)They want to kick you, if you are 1v5 and you want to save an AWP or other expensive gun.AND STORY CONTINUES........I really recommend to find a friends and play together.SKINSIn game you can buy skins. Nice, you can ""upgrade"" your game how you want. But there fun ENDS. Do you want some beauty skin on an USP? - Pay about 5€!Do you want some beauty skin on M4/AK47? - Pay 10+€!Do you want some beauty skin on an AWP? - Pay  20+€!NOT ENOUGH? Do you want some beauty skin on Knife? -♥♥♥♥♥♥your wallet and bank account and PAY 300+€!!No, I am not kidding. 300€ for pixels into game, that costs 10€. Ridiculous? Yes, I know. VALVE's RANKING SYSTEMAnother thing you should know until you start play competetive. Believe me, rank in this game doesn't show your right skill. There are a lot of boosted accounts. You can get Rank-up if you are last with 2/10, but you can get Rank-down if you lose on first place with a good score. Even my friend got Rank-down AFTER WIN. Yes, it can happen, when you play competetive.VALVE ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM (VAC) Of course, they improved it, but still VAC is quite broken. Because there are a lot of hackers. And how you going upper and upper, the worst it gets. SMURFSMaybe I should add this topic to COMMUNITY, but it's that important, so it deserves separated topic. I think, there are more and more and way more smurfs than before. It's a ""good feel"", if you get 3x oneshot headshot in row by 1 man. So, you want check out his profile, clearly for sure and then you see: Lvl 1 profile without avatar, only with 1 game - CS:GO with about 60/100 hours on it. I don't get, why do they create new Steam profile, buy CS:GO and play against weaker players. They gotta to kill lower ranks to get a higher ego? Why do they not play on FACEIT/ESEA? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, if you want to get the cancer, but you dont even smoke and these included cons don't matter for ya - BUY IT! :)But the game itself is great :)MY OVERAL RATING - 5/10",0

12475,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is the first time I've requested a refund on any game. I was looking forward to playing but out of the 70 minutes of game time I logged up I actually only had 20 minutes of actual game time. The other 50 minutes of time was spent looking at a splash screen which I then had to restart over and over and over until such time as I miraculously managed to get past it and got access to the game at which point it then crashed. Rinse and repeat...Once I finally got in the poor translation made the game almost unplayable. It was very much a push a button and hopefully stumble across the right one. It was a miracle that I got as far through the tutorial as I did. If no effort was put in the tutorial, the first introduction to any game, then it doesn't bode well for the rest of the game.It's a shame as I think it has great potential but sadly it hasn't lived up to it's promised.

Maybe if you REALLY love poker this might do it for you, or you wanted to practice poker with other people it might be for you?",0

But given that this is an online game, the fun gets taken away by other players. You have trolls, cheaters, smurfs (=high-ranked players on new accounts to play against low ranks to feel proud of themselves), and generally other ******** who think smacktalking players who are worse than you is fun.Pair that with the salty teammates you get during competetive games, who get angry at you for not winning certain situations they wouldn't have won either.If you plan to buy this game, be prepared to meet the worst kind of people you can imagine.In other words: the players ruin an otherwise good game.",0
13572,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is pretty buggy for me (still in Alpha, so understandable), but when I finally get a game going it is fun.  Ships look great with lots of detail and adds to the immersion. I know this will sound generic, but this game, for me, just makes hopping in a big ship and shooting other people fun. I love space based settings and this game just makes me happy. As for gameplay, I've only played Conquest mode, not sure if the other one is available yet. It's kind of a MOBA-lite. No juggling of items, your ship is your character and they have a nice lot of them to  work toward, you choose from 3 types of upgrades once you get enough resources (attack, defense, utilities) and they simply just make your skills better. You still need to work as a team for map control (resources for upgrades + access to other teams base) and eventually attack the other ones base. This conflict is what leads to the glorious looking and fun space battles.I figured I would play this one and forget it, but I keep playing a  bit each day and it hits the spot.",1

I deleted it because it takes a bigger space in my disk compared to other games Im playing. But since I really like to try the game, I reinstalled it. It worked and I fell in love with the game.  However, in the middle of the game, it stopped working and can't open it anymore. I waited for 2days because I thought that there was just a maintenance. After 2days, still no working and as I view the community and forums, I am not the only one experiencing the same issue.  I was able to find a fix posted by a player I guess. It worked but again in the middle of the game, I encountered the same error. TOS then again stopped working until now. Tried the fixes again but still not working. I am tired of reinstalling it as the time needed to complete downloading is very long. Thank you. I hope the error can be fixed some time. The game has big potential.",0

17919,theHunter Classic,2014.0,"Being British I haven't really been interested in hunting, but after playing theHunter for a few hours I have to say It was very fun.The reason I don't recommend the game is purely due to the fact that it is heavily dependant on spending real cash to really experience all that the game has to offer, which is VERY expensive. As a free to play player you can only hunt ""Mule Deer"", granted that the 'free' rifle you get allows you to kill more than that, you obviously can't because you don't have the proper license to hunt them. While you can earn the free currency by completing missions (17 in total for Mule Deer, which is the only ones you can do as a free player), doing so you could afford to buy maybe a 1 day license for whatever species, but then to continue earning the free currency you'd actually have to pay real money to reset these missions for Mule Deer, which is pointless if you either don't want to pay to carry on playing as such, or if you don't have the money spare, but you do want to carry on playing because you do actually enjoy playing. There is no incentive for free players to carry on playing due to basically having the game shove the need to pay real money to really progress.",0
12971,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Review--2/14/2017--Came back to check the game out, see what's changed, put a few more hours in. Absolutely garbage. I wish I could give an even worse recommendation than 'no'. The game isn't fun. Making new or more interesting bots is now more difficult than ever.It may not be 'pay to win', but it sure as hell is 'pay to have fun'. This game isn't worth your time anymore.They now have a brawl mode, which mixes up how the game is normally played, bans certain parts, changes certain balancing in the game. It's attrocious. It's poorly thought out, poorly implemented, and just makes it clear exactly how incompetent the devs are.Stay away from this game.-----------------------------Well, FJ hasn't done anything about income as of yet, and just the past Thursday (June 16, 2016) they release a major patch with no changes to income. I think I will be officially and permanently calling it quits for this game. I haven't played  for weeks now, and have no intention of reinstalling anytime soon.----Old Review----(I'll change this review when it's worth changing)Hate the new crate system. If FreeJam wanted to reduce income, then reduce income. Instead of cutting the amount earned from a battle by 10% or 50% or what ever they wanted, they instead decided to slash income to near 0%. Want to build a sick double IND hover? Sorry, you'll either have to spend money, or sell nerly every valuable item you have. Alternatively you can say ♥♥♥♥ it. Not build that sweet hover, and instead hope that in the next month, you'll get two legendary drops for that component.I have no idea what the actual drop percentage for an IND is, but is seems to be something of the order 1 in 10000 crates. Meaning your chance of getting two IND is as likely as being attacked by a shark. I have only gotten 3 legendaries since the update. At the time of posting this, it's been over five weeks since the epic loot update. I play semi-regularly. In other words, don't hold your breath. If you want a good bot, you have to spend money. End of story. Oh, almost forgot: I've had premium since the epic loot update dropped. Meaning I'm twice as likely to get a legendary from a crate. If you are a non-premium player, expect this to take twice as long.",0

Also game glitching and when you dc you can still die. I have a lot of videos of the game crashing and still killing me when im not even in the game anymore. Also have video of like 5 people spawning ontop of each other and the last one to join wins because of the ♥♥♥♥ing spawn shield. I have also been killed by invisible zombies before because the game glitches the. Also when driving a buggie down the road at 45 A SINGLE ♥♥♥♥ING ZOBIE can stop you dead in you tracks like really you should be able to run them ♥♥♥♥♥es over from 5-55 and never get stopped. Also when going prone say on a stair case you cant look down only straight. I use to love this ame until i realized the designers never got their heads out of their asses. Maybe if you focused on fixing the game and listening to its playes instead of getting all the hackes first then it would be more enjoyable.,0
1515,DCS World Steam Edition,2018.0,"Not a very good sim. The venerable old FSX is of far higher quality than this is. I'm a former aircraft mechanic and veteran who worked on some of these planes. I know pretty much everything about them. So, yes, I know exactly what I'm talking about as an expert in the field.Furthermore, the company behind this game often engages in unethical business practices. Raising and lowering prices in an attempt to make more money off each sale by making the sales appear bigger than they actually are. For example, an aircraft that has been listed for years at a $9.99 price has been jacked up to $14.99 on this and previous Summer or Winter sales only to return to the normal price a month or two after the sale ends. Other games by other Russian developers have also engaged in this tactic. I do not mind supporting developers, but for them to engage in unethical behavior in order to siphon money from the player base is wrong.Also, they use the controversial Starforce spyware on all of their DLC. This has been known to damage computer systems in the past (I have two damaged dvd drives as proof that were killed by Starforce that was on the Cycling Manger 3 game all those years ago). But not only is it very intrusive software, but it is also spyware. Something that I didn't think t hat Valve would ever allow on Steam.Game is NOT RECOMMENDED due to its lack of realism, unsavory business practices by the developer and inclusion of spyware in DLC content.",0

18475,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI once played this game called Robocraft. I found it through a friend of mine and quicly got addicted to it. Playing the battles with completly different robots and weapons was amazing, seeing people use planes either as bombers or as fighters was just something that inspired me to actually reach lvl 80. The spider legs update, AMAZING. So cool to crawl a wall and shoot down stuff. Spider legs with wings? AWESOME! I loved it because it was a grinding game, something that took skill either to construct or fight enemies. I really had much fun. But then, the worst update of all times came. All the time I took to get to level 80, wasted. Because they introduced crates. CS:GO, LoL, OW, those are games that you win cases to have cosmetics and stuff, but this, no. Before if I wanted to buy lets say, a new pair of laser guns, I would have to play max of 5 matches, depending on the way that you played, if you had a good score, if you helped win the game. Now when you do all of those good stuff, you only earn a higher probability crate. Probability, so you can still get sh*t loot from it. It's completly pay to progress. It's embarrasing how such a good game became a pile of complete utter sh*t.Please read your reviews. The really long ones that tell you what's good and wrong in this game. If you do that you'll see your player count rising up again. Make this game great again.",0

You can  just do an attack carnival and win every time in the beginning missions. Is really boring because of that.",0

I watched streams for the first time thanks to this game. That all means very little now.Hirez Announced OB64 Today. Completely destroying a core component of the game. The Card based skill system. They copied Battlefront 2's failed P2W progression system. Casual is now based on how much you can spend or how much crazy time you can grind to earn options you had easier and sometimes direct access to before this patch. Legendary cards (the choice that most defined your playstyle with a character) is now tiered the same way, forcing you to pull out the wallet, and take a chance. Everything i had done and learned was just ripped away. Now it's the pay-way or the highway. They used to ask you to buy lootboxes. Now they are demanding it. Hirez went from beggars to Loansharks. If this patch goes live next week, i hope they cvatch the same sh!tstorm EA caught. Anyone else remember when games were an artform, not a casino?When is Belgium making a ruling on lootboxes again?",0
18957,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2018.0,"The game difficulty is way to steep, sudden and abrupt.

Try beating ""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"" when the cards Konami gives you as winning reward are ""Spirit of the Mountain"", ""Mystical Moon"", ""Fake Trap""   - that's what Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel links is all about. Overall:  BAD, ""raging punch a hole in your display"" bad, Lackluster gameplay bad, clunky controls bad, unresponsive & unhelpful slow and uninspired UI, no original audio, The game tries to cash in on nostalgia and offers little to none gameplay enjoyment. i've had more fun in unofficial games that paid tribute to the franchise.

19085,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAt first glance, one might find AQ3D to be a pretty basic, not-so-difficult hack and slash mmo. But this game, in my opinion, does so much more than just appeal to longtime Artix Entertainment fans. Honestly, it, in a way, is revolutionary (hear me out). Not only is AE tapping into the cross-class playtype (which i haven't seen in almost any games), they're making a game that doesn't just hand you everything you want. The first few levels go by no problem, and you're appropriately geared. However as the game starts to veer towards dungeon-crawling and actual grinding, one finds themselves actually having to work for items. To be properly geared heading into a new zone or just for new dungeon content, you actually have to work. This involves not only fighting zone bosses for items to craft better gear, it also incorperates working through dungeons with other players for the same reasons. If that's not enough, AE is a company that WILL listen to fan input (amazing, isn't it?). The content creators constantly interact with fans. There's transparency from the staff on upcoming updates and issues they're working to solve. As far as bugs, this game is in beta. Those of us playing are here to help sort out the bugs and get the game ready for final release. That being said it is already a pretty complete game with TONS of fun content and many planned seasonal events (including one going on at the time of this review being written). I recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a fun, immersive cross-platform experience.",1
19270,Star Trek Online,2016.0,"With well over 500 hours on this game i feel that i have to write a review. Firstly lets just say this, if you are not a person who likes to grind do not play thing game. This game is for people who really enjoy startrek universe. The game at times can be boring or diffucult at times but there are so many different things that you can do from PvP to PvE and even player-made content. You do not have to use mircotransactions to purchase anything as they have a few big events every year that reward some decent ships. The community is big and it is never hard to make your way into a fleet/clan. Overall i give it a 10/10 just because it is one of the best StarTrek games out there.",1

2026,Neverwinter,2017.0,"I am going to start off by saying that this game tries far to hard, and it lies. I am not saying it is difficult game, but it's trying to be something it's not. The game was released a year before the final production of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition was released, and everything about the game screams 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons. I mean, if you like 4th Edition D&D, all the more power to you, but it says in an advertisement that this is a 5th Edition D&D game, they are lying.A few things I do like about the game were the ease of difficulty, there is not a huge weight of difficulty starting off the game for most classes. Playing a Ranger is basically saying ""Well, I'm putting Iron Knuckles in my Boxing Gloves, let's Box!"" I mean there are just so many advantages to some of the classes. Drawback is, you won't be playing more than 2, unless you subscribe, buy character slots, etc.I think this game tries to be unique, but doesn't get far enough along that line. That being said, sure there is a following for this game, but I spend most of my time sitting at a campsite when I play. Which brings me to the Cons of the discussion. The biggest con is the religion prayer factor. ""I'm going to just sit here for a few days, and pray my way to level 50."" Trust me, you can do just that. Which is completely stupid. In no way, shape, or form is that good for your character, or the game. 1) You lose out on potential items, and gear you might otherwise find through playing the game, and it's a form of cheating in my eyes. You do nothing, and get lots of things back for it.Another con is the simple fact that this game is highly pay to win. They expect you to spend money on at least something as you play through the game. I don't care if it's items, or pretty much anything from cosmetics, etc. They pretty much encourage it, especially if you're praying your way to level 50, you get discounts left and right for 15% off this, or that. Doesn't matter what it is, it's still going to cost you money, as the money transactions at set evenly with money, which is fine for some games, but what I mean is $10 is minimum you can use, and you get 1,000 in-store money. That being said, almost everything costs 1,000, or you can only buy 1 or 2 items with it. I personally won't be buying anything on this game. Don't fall for that ""If I get this, I will be on par with everyone else"" routine, at the end of the day, you only lost.I also think one of the bigger issues with the game is the community. It's nearly toxic, I say nearly, because most people in the game simply just ignore you. Anything you do, etc. Also on another note it is stalker-friendly as games go. It lists a player's entire account information: Character Name @ Account ID. That being said, if you know someone uses a particular ID, you could probably use Find Person to find them. Also from what a i learned from someone who had been playing for years ""Unless you're in a guild, or their guild, most people just ignore you."" In the end, this con is pretty common as MMORPGs go these days. It's not a big loss, but there are a lot of games where the community is much more friendly, and interactive, hence why this game is nearly toxic. (Some people take the game far too seriously.)In closing, there are many ways to play this game, but few of them are as unique as any edition of Dungeons & Dragons. I guess the fruit falls off the tree, and rolls down the hill here, as it is far from any game I'd consider a true D&D game. Plus, the whole condtradiction/lie about it being 5th edition is completely false. Just the racial benefits alone are a big give away. (4th Edition used 2 sets of +2's for it's races, while 5th Edition had a +2, or a +1 to one, two, or all attributes, and rarely had, any only has to this day the Mountain Dwarf that gets a +2/+2 like the standard Dwarf in Neverwinter.) Also, the attribute system is broken, how can you 'roll' for dice if their going to be that broken about it? Use a point buy system or something, that's at least legit. Not to mention their ""Feat"" system is basically just a renamed standard MMORPG skill tree with nothing ""Feat"" like about it. Especially not 5th Edition if that is what they were intending to come off as.Play the game, see for yourself.",0
1237,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIn my opinion game runs amazing, slight lag at the start nothing that  bothersome, mostly runs very smooth and it feels good, looks good. Max players ive seen is 130 in a match and the map seems very big.  The way you can see your teamates pings is awesome. I like the feel of the abilities and the different classes. I have gone on the discord to find groups and played with people i know, there is no solo queue (there is duos and 4 squads) but i would imagine they are going to add it soon. In my opinion great game. I think it will appeal to everyone and it will take over pubg (poorly optomized) and fortnite (building mechanic is dumb in my opinion) I like how you can forge differnt epic weapons and raid other peopel forging epic weapons. You can see smoke outside the forges... all in all just great game mechanics, and a 6gb download really can't go wrong.

9897,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI used to be very skeptic of this game, already owning Battleborn and Overwatch, but eventually got quite curious about this. I downloaded this, and honestly have no regrets. Here is why I think so: The characters, inspired by Overwatch in many ways, are fun to play as, and allow players to improve them to their liking in making card loadouts. There is a good balance in character potential, at most times, and every time I play I face new challenges and players that I enjoy battling past.The locked characters and some customizations can be gained by earning gold through playing the game.You can gain credits for a round to get your character minor bonuses that can help your combat depending on your choosing.However...what isn't good about the game is: Sometimes you will feel or be absolutely helpless to certain enemy attacks, such as a well-placed bomb by Skye or you push the cart as an enemy uses a knockpack attack that throws you into a nearby eviromental hazard.

310,PlanetSide 2,2017.0,"Great game that a player can get a lot of 'free' fun fragging out of.To a new player this game can be a bit daunting and farming certs (at first) comes slow and turns many away.To gain certs faster (at first) you need to be an engi/med, stack your ability to gain more certs by spending certs in things that help others, forget weapons at first, if you work on your repair tool, ammo giving, health/shield giving, remote repping/ammo in a sundi while acting as a passive mobile medic for people close to your vehicle etc. Maybe spend a few certs on a scope if you find time to use it.Join a platoon/squad and actually fight with them as support and your +% bonus to certs increases giving you more certs. Joining a platoon/squad is also a great way to find big battles. Some outfits can be a bit authoritarian e.g. if you do not come and fight in the spot they are fighting in then they will kick you. Personally I think that is a bit lame, however you want certs and being in a constant battle is the best way to earn them.It is a hard slog at first and I made it harder by buying a gun for 1k certs when I could have increased my passive cert making skills as above, now however I make so much passive certs using engi/med with little work that I have 1k certs to spend on guns etc every couple of days.I have never spent a penny on this game, some customisations are given to the non spenders like me, such as the big christmas bow and the salty paintjob etc.There is a lot more to say about this game, such as the huge maps and battles that push front lines back and forth for hours whilst trying to outflank the opposing force.

HOLY CRAP IS THIS GAME WELL MADE. Okay, so it rips off some other horror games, but it uses them all pretty well. When you get to a new checkpoint, and move to a new area, the door animation looks directly ripped from the first Resident Evil. That alone sent chills down my spine. And the fact that no two games are the same makes for an interesting playthrough. What might have been the way to get out of a room once might change completly the next time you find that room. Oh, and you will also find the same rooms all the time. The only differences are that some monster/ghost is in the next room. With the hidden layers of story like FNAF, the gameplay of Amnesia (wandering around aimlessly), and the erieness of Slender, this game is fantastic.",1

1694,GUNS UP!,2018.0,For a free game it's very good. Played for a few hours straight and didn't get bored. Yes the layouts are the same but difficulty increases. Few different game modes which are enjoyable and the PVP is fun too. Not loads to do yet is still fun.,1
3953,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"Yea a red sheep in a blue sea. Problems starts in the same order as when you catch a cold in the middle of summer and the first thing is the runny nose and watery eyes, when you know you'll be fine only in the penultimate day? - Got the game for free expecting microtransactions at some point in the middle. But a minute after naming my vault to number 10 (to keep with their hocus-pocus tradition) the game was minimized without my authorization and my browser went up straight to the store and to Fallout 4 web page. Couldn't you even wait greedy-boy?- I was learning the basics, then this tutor-boy with a bipolar temperament that should be helping me eventually became very annoying. Even after turning him off he just couldn't cease to interrupt my game by blocking the screen to ask for paper. Curiously enough, ''B'' on Joystick is always meant for ''NO'', but there it was meant for ''YES''.Don't click-bait my @ss so soon without seducing me first.- At first, playing with a mouse was the proper way to go but after fighting with the screen edge I decided to use the joystick. But then after fighting with the dwellers selection I got confused. I saw myself in the embarrassing situation of playing with both controls at the same time. One couldn't fulfill the role of the other.- Suddenly the zooming and the camera proved to be pretty clumsy, hud often disappears and you need that all the time. There is a command to show that but it just not practical without some sort of observation camera or neutral point. But as Kurt would say, whatever. Nevermind.- The lack of comfort regarding general gameplay made me leave the game. I feel more content awaits, but not for me.Maybe they didn't bothered in making this thing looking more like a PC game. Maybe I'm talking s#it, maybe this was probably meant to be more interesting with a g0ddamn cellphone to help selling Fallout 4 - Bethesda charges 229 bucks for it here when AÂ³ games are around 100 - maybe they think its that much worth. So no I can't see this as a PC game, I would rather PAY to have fun so microtransactions could be an option. Its just another money grab and another opportune advertising to push you into. I'll give them that.",0

However, one guy, and I forget his username, wrote a review of the true reason for some of the devs responses. First of all, they will shut down your account if you are inactive for too long. However, you can get it back by msging the team. The reason for doing this is to prevent your account from being hacked thus protecting your real money purchases or anything you own. They did this with me and I contacted them and not even a day later they responded and gave my account back. The list goes on. For the gameplay, it is fun although it can get a little repetitive.

2492,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"I have played this game for a lot of years. During that time I have met a lot of great people, and also quite a bunch of people who I wish I'd never meet.Unfortunately, I've joined the scene quite late as I first started playing this in January 2011, a point where the game was still optimized and still fun. As years passed by I've seen the game go downhill more and more each update. The performance of the game was getting worse and the content Valve kept adding was not contributing to the game one single bit, if anything it just killed more and more frames on a lot of machines, no matter how powerful they are.The latest update ""Meet your Match"" was the final straw for me. Them replacing pub servers with ""Casual"" servers, which are basically pubs with a competitive setting really didn't do it for me. Competitive could've kept this game alive if they implemented this years ago. If you ask me, they are way too late with doing this and I personally do not see a future for this game anymore.If anyone would ask me, I would not recommend Team Fortress 2 to anyone. Even though I have never played Overwatch, I'd say that game holds a much greater future than TF2 would ever achieve.EDIT: Well then, to my surprise they're actually doing something about this whole issue.

16323,School of Dragons,2015.0,"This is a ""zen"" game.  It's not an adventure, it's a game you play to relax.Hatch and tame a dragon.  Grow him to adulthood.

As of yet, there is no ""battle"".Yes.  This is a game for kids.  I'm guessing their target audiance is 6-12 year olds, but even for adults, it's nice to relax when you want a ""no think"" 20 minutes or so with your favorite dragon.As a warning, like most ""free"" online games, all the ""cool stuff"" you have to pay for.  The basic dragons (from the first movie) are free to hatch and raise.

2211,Crush Crush,2017.0,"Interesting mix of dating genre and clicker games. Crush Crush starts great with many likeable girls around and it tries to be bit similiar to great HuniePop game by the first look.BUT, after your reach about half of the game, you hit the wall and your progress halts to snail-pace, everything takes just too much time - while jobs and hobbies takes forever to level up. Even raising multiplier using soft reset again and again doesn't help much. Mind me, you simply can't reach the end of this game without using gems and with two or three last girls the goals are so ridiculous one has to resort to auto-clicking macros to even complete it in sane amount of time.Also, the current event system is punishing for players, if you miss one or two days you are basically out of the game. Even worse, events don't auto-complete after you start them - so many times you lose your progress just because you don't login in short daily reset window which is annoying.Really not recommended, it's nice at first but it quickly turns into grinding chore that's not fun anymore.",0

3508,Infestation: The New Z,2016.0,"Infestation: New Z is a brand new experience in the Zombie Survival genre. In some ways, it's clear that Infestation: New Z borrowed inspiration from other titles, including Infestation: Survivor Stories, The War Z, Infestation World and Infestation World Thailand, but it's very clear that Infestation: New Z has taken a brave turn in a new direction and after playing through it, it's obvious that there is just no room for comparison between those aforementioned titles. It's newer than The War Z, it has just as much infestation as Infestation: Survivor Stories, and it has far less ladyboys than Infestation World Thailand - If that's not reason enough to press download, I don't know what is.

18594,War Thunder,2015.0,"Pros: + it's fairly pretty + Lots of historical aircraft to flyCons: - Extreme Russian Bias - Rife with historical inaccuracies, despite labelling itself as a simulator, and these historical inaccuracies that completely UNbalance the game - Forum Mods will ban anyone who speaks ill of the game, other players, the Motherland or any mention of ways to improve the game - Frequent updates that fix jack sh*t - It used to be great, but it was barrelling downhill pretty fast in the lead up to the Steam release. I gave it a while, figuring the devs were somehow busy trying to get it through Steam's aggressive quality control, but after having come back to it nearly three years down the line, it has devolved extremely far. I write this review, both as a warning to new incoming players, and as an attempt to get through to those who for some reason still love this game. This game has extreme potential, but until the devs stop kidding themselves that the USSR was a technological power house that can make any machine perform better just by adoring itself with a Russian paint scheme, we will never se this game in any sort of actually historically accurate or balanced light.",0
2856,PlanetSide 2,2016.0,"The game is solid. I have about 38 hours on my steam account, but I've played the game for about 200-300 hours before it was on Steam.It's a good game, you can check its undeniable qualities among good reviews around, but it has serious issues that still haven't been resolved after all these years.- The faction balancing is very poor in regard of the Vanu; they are always (and it's been consistent for 3 to 4 years) more numerous than any other faction, which makes it almost impossible to win big battles against them, or even small skirmishes since they have the most veterans of the game. (EDIT: I re-tried the game for the first time since a few months, and I fought (and died instantly) against swarms of Vanu players that had 20-30x more time in the game than me, so around 4000 gaming hours each. The game is now half empty, and the players left seem to be all lvl 2000-3000 Vanu veterans that will murder you without giving you a single chance of finding fun in the game. Just so it's clear.)- You can't properly play solo to the game; if you're not with a considerable team, it's extremely complicated to join bigger squads for large battles on the fly, plus, there aren't really any chain of command, so orders either get lost or it's pure chaos, which can be fun util you go back to my first point: you can't win against Vanu if you don't organize your assault properly. Sure, you're gonna have some great moments if you try just to play alone, even in large scale assaults, but they're not gonna be enough to outgrow the constant frustrations.- The F2P model isn't quite F2P. Sure you can stick to it and not spend a single penny on the game, and you should fare just OK. But it brings an even more massive problem:- The progression is terribly slow. It's fun to fight and get points to spend in new skills, weapons, vehicles (aerial and terrestrial), upgrades for your shields, for the ammo you can carry, for the weapons of your vehicles, etc - until you realize that you need the SAME type of currency won in-game to unlock them all. You can't get said currency without playing a LOT - if you're outrageously lucky and proactive you can get up to 200-250 points in an hour of gameplay, but this is barely enough for two or three levels of any kind of upgrade, and I'm not even mentioning weapons, which can cost a few thousands and not be worthwile, or be completely unfairly strong. You can get these points a LOT faster by paying the premium fee, plus a few other bonuses; the game isn't P2W, but considering the really, really, really useful and advantageous nature of the upgrades you can get for everything in the game, players who pay get a lot stronger a lot faster.- Finally, my last point concerns the state of the server. It's actually pretty good, with a little twist: this is a massive scale FPS, making Battlefield look like a claustrophobic's nightmare; therefore, for the server to pick up the informations coming out of your PC, to transmit it to the server, and to do the same with every other character and object in the game, that takes a gargantuous amount of bandwidth; if your connexion isn't top notch, top tier, top whatever you want, you'll be gravely disadvantaged - a lot more than in any other FPS. In comparison, I have a pretty lousy connexion at the moment, which is new to me, but I fare just well in Rainbow Six Siege. In PS2 though, I'm barely more than a moving meatbag with a ""SHOOT ME"" sign on his back.So, TL;DR: All in all, PlanetSide 2 is a good game. If you don't mind paying for the premium access (or if you're really patient), if you have large teams (like a guild or something like that) to play with at all time, if you're lucky on the amount of Vanu against you and if your connexion rocks, this game is a must. But without all that, it's gonna give you a hard time pretty much all the time. Try it (it's free after all), and make your own opinion on the game.",0

2377,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,"Help, I've become addicted to this game. No joke. ""Why?"" you ask? Let me sum up my experience so far. : )First and foremost, the game is quite original with it's colorful and quirky characters, which I've come to absolutely adore. Each character has their own (stereotypical but hilarious) personality, and it's really fun to watch them interact and talk. Being able to play as each is a blast.Community wise, I've met a handful of awesome and cooperative people who are great to play with. You never know who you'll run into in online games, but it's totally worth it when people are friendly and talk to one another. Once in a while, you'll come across players that are complete jerks, but I assure you that you'll find a server with a bunch of dorks you can party and have fun with. XDApparently I have been on TF2 for only 157.8 hours (total), but it feels like at least a year.

12777,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewAs with any Early Access game, make sure it is a game you are okay with it being changed as development goes on. As it stands, the game plays very similar to the first, with some minor changes. So far it seems to be living up to the greatness that was Dungeon Defenders 1.Understand that because it is early access, I know a lot of my concerns with the game will be fixed, and I will update my review when that happens.Pros/Cons:+ The AI seems to be smarter, and more dificult than those in the first game.+ The ability to move your hero while in place/repair/upgrade defense mode is amazing.+ The Dual Mana system is also an awesome addition. You now have mana for abilities, and a separate mana for towers.+ The new defenses each hero has are either upgrades from the first game, or new all together, which is good.+ The ability to vote for the next addition into the game is an awesome early access feature, and should be done more often by developers.- The gear upgrade system is lacking, and confusing at first. - There has yet to be added a proper tutorial system for new features.- The small amount of maps gets old quite fast, and the game tends to get boring after a bit.- Costumes and pets are nowhere to be found, and is one of the things that made the first game a favorite.- The gear shops are barely useful, as the only reason I use them is to get junk gear to upgrade my current stuff.All in all, the game is damn good, and can only get better from here.",1

16738,Dota 2,2014.0,"When I started playing Dota 2 I absolutely hated it. I refused to play it. No one could convince me to go through the pain and suffering of repeatedly dying, being outplayed by everyone and the abuse that came with those performances. During The International 3, I decided to make an effort to watch the tournament and it completely blew me away. Orange tearing through the Losers Bracket, taking out DK and pushing towards the finals. The commentators were going wild, I had absolutely no idea what was actually going on but I knew it was epic. This brought me back to the game. We're now in the middle of The International 4 a n entire year later, I now have over 700 hours played and almost 450 games listed on my Dotabuff.Dota 2 is like an abusive relationship. It's a genuinely great game, competitive gaming at its near finest. When you do well you feel fantastic, you've earned it - you outplayed and outsmarted the opponents. You'll have games you won't forget about with big performances and dramatic team fights. But there are games that will haunt you due to ferocious emotional abuse from team mates. These games don't end quickly, you can be harassed for half an hour during a slow and painful loss. The community isn't as bad as other MOBAs, but it's very easy to blame other people. If you win, people will sing your praises through the game. If you lose, and if you're a support like myself - prepare yourself.  I've played a fair amount of MOBAs, from League of Legends and HoN to the more abstract Awesomenauts and Smashmuck Champions. Dota 2 has to be rated as the best. It's tactically sound, it's gorgeous to look at, the 100+ heroes are all interesting and challenging and the team synergy is there to be picked up on. You can win games by choosing a more aggressive or pushing lineup. Go for team fight heroes and combine to wipe out the opponents or make space for certain heroes to keep the game going for as long as possible and win late into the game. Games can range from 10 minute stomps to 75+ epics. The game mechanics are for your team to gain gold and experience from killing creeps and opponents, but also to deny gold and experience by denying creeps and team mates - killing them so they can't get the kill. Everything is tactical, where you go in the map, at which times, controlling vision, acquiring runes or when to defend and when to push for towers or ancients. This is again, why the entry point into the game is so difficult. There is a very steep learning curve. You also have a shop menu to work out which items you should buy to help your heroes in different ways. You will learn this with experience. I have put this much time, effort and stupidity into this game and I still don't know a lot of things about the game. I still don't fully understand what heroes counter which, and I don't have full understanding of some abilities or item builds. It takes time and patience. Dota 2. It's a game I grew to really appreciate, but still a game that can ruin your day in one disastrous game. The competitive scene is great and fully supported by the game developers, it's constantly updated with community created cosmetics, mini events or new heroes. And the only time that in-game purchases are required is for specialist things like team pennants, tournament passes or cosmetics for your courier or hero unlike that of other MOBAs that require you to earn or purchase heroes to have the chance to broaden your playing experience. Easily recommended, but just be wary and try to keep your team mates relaxed and mediate them during those bad losses. You can't win every game. ",1

I love tf2 but this patch, no the last several patches are blatent cashgrabes that add nothing to the game and take away little by little everything people loved about the game. It's sad when you either have to find a community server that I get near 250 ping or play bot matches just to entertain myself playing this game. I can't honestly recommend that anyone plays this unless valve fixes the horrible mistake that mym was. And I don't mean ""fix"" it by just polishing competitive and casual. here is a list of some of the big things valve needs to fix1. Get rid of casual2. bring back vanilla pubs3. new weopens NOT reskins4. buff the heavy not the pyro5. stop trying to be overwatch6. fix competitive and make it playable7.

7467,Digimon Masters Online,2017.0,"Pros:-Free-Easy to access-Wide variety of DigimonCons:-Only 4 Digivolution trees per character (you can make like 30 characters, but that's tedious; guess that's why so many slots are locked behind a paywall)-Essentially pay to win (hatching lv3 eggs is hard enough, but I hear lv5 is necessary late-game)-Words cut in half in dialogue-Poor grammar-Terribly unintersting storyline-Crashes consistently (in my sub-hour playtime, it crashed twice)-Difficult to learn (controls definitely take a long time to understand and get used to, and the game does a horrible job of explaining things to you)tldr:  Not the Digimon game you're hoping it is.I do hope they put more effort in the future as I do want to see this game succeed.  When I decided to give it a chance on Steam, I was considering buying some items with real money if the game had developed to a playable and enjoyable experience, but since my time with the pre-Steam version last year, not much has changed.

I'll have 5 days where I'll have lots of fun and feel like everything was pretty fair, but then one day...every match I'm against better-equipped enemies, all of my shots splash into the sea everywhere around my targets, every team is horrible and every match is lost from the start. You didn't get outplayed, you didn't constantly ♥♥♥♥ up; you just lost every gamble in a game where they're everywhere.

9932,Fractured Space,2016.0,"This game brings the best of a lot of others.World of tanks / warships like ship-on-ship combat. Each ship having different abilities, weapons, and upgrades that increase or decrease the effectivness of that weapons stats based on your playstyle. (Think increased duration but decreased buff, etc) The Really Good. The game is fun. Teamwork with friends is rewarding and games that are won really feel like there was an accomplishment or outsmarting that happened. Matchmaking seems to work well though I haven't leveled up far enough yet to experience the higher MMR amounts.Graphics are beautiful. Windowed full screen available, and all the bells and wistles you could really ask for to make the game look great.Lots of ships to chose from. Skins, upgrades, and crew that can flesh out your ship and maximize it's performanceThe badQueue times are sometimes slow for matchmaking. I blame this mostly on the game trying to keep MMR working well, and secondly on amount of players. As this game continues to grow in popularity, I see no reason this problem will remain.Re-balancing is needed in some places. This is expected and will improve as the devs continue to update the game beyond release which they have shown they intend to. It's been the same experience in games such as Overwatch etc.More missions / rewards are needed. Currently there is a daily set of 3 missions you can complete. They are to play 2, 4, and 6 games. (With the 6th game completing the last mission) This rewards you 3 times with an increasing valued amount of platinum (in game premium currency), silver, DNA (used to buy and create crew), crew templates (used to create crew from), and boosts (which give a credit boost at the end of a game if you use it in the after action report screen). The game would keep me playing more often if there were other daily challenges to complete. Say for example, complete 10 takedowns in 1 game or something like that. The difficulty of each mission can then be scaled with reward.The Final Word Highly recommend. Really I do. This game only can be BETTER the more that people play it and play with friends. With the onset of competitive play coming soon, and rebalance changes, as well as hopefuly more ships, skins, and someday game modes, this game will continue to keep me coming back for a while.",1
17556,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2013.0,"Whether you're a casual FPS gamer or a very competitive hard-core player, CS:GO is where it's at.  A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value.  There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option.  CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals.  It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!).Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics.  You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky!  I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS).  The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000!  It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5.  With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot.  Don't be discouraged by the learning curve.  With great effort, comes great rewards!  Now GO buy it!!",1

12365,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewWhile the beginning is pretty boring what with catching Bluegills and all, it's worth it to get to level three so you can start using lures.  Bass and Catfish are possible at level 2, but you'll probably catch more Bluegills than anything.  Once you get some spoons and jigs, the real fun begins and levelling goes much faster from there.  I sat down with a six pack of beer and before I knew it a couple hours had passed and I was out of beer.I like that the game tries to teach you proper fishing techniques, which you can then apply to real world fishing.  I've learned a few things and will try them out next time I get on a boat because shore fishing in my area is pretty poor.  Overall it's a great game with lots of potential.",1
16782,DCS World Steam Edition,2017.0,"Man, what a letdown. First off, the flight model for the two free planes is arcadey even on the ""simulation"" setting. The aerodynamics have been simplified to the point where your aircraft doesn't feel like it's interacting with the air at all. You'll shake at certain angles and stall at certain angles, but for the most part you can fly with total disregard for how your bird should be interacting with the air around it. They've certainly invested a lot of time in having a keyboard control for every button and switch in the cockpit, but that seems frivolous when the flight model feels arcadey.The cockpits are photorealistic, but the terrain is hideous. The landscape is unrealistically flat in most places. Cities and towns are badly photoshopped together, with layouts and angles that make no sense and roads passing directly through buildings. Most of the buildings are completely flat 2D images on the terrain, although there are some simple 3D buildings. After flying aircraft over the detailed and fully 3D landscape in ARMA 3, it's impossible to enjoy flying over these ugly vistas. The sound design is atrocious. 90% of the time, all you hear is a 1-second loop of engine noise. While a more skilled sound designer would have used atmospheric noises like wind whistling over the cockpit and around the airframe to break up the audio monotony, the atmospheric noise in DCS is so quiet you'll have to cut your throttle back almost to nothing just to catch faint whispers of the air around your cockpit.",0

5523,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game is a straight forward non-gimmicky(no building as in Fortnite, no forging equipment as Realm Royale) battle royale. It has some fresh ideas like all the players spawning at the same time on the map, not flying in at trying to land before the others. You have a pistol/shotgun from the start so you are not completely on the mercy of the RNG weapon spawns. Good guns are relatively easy to find. The decreasing of the playing area is done by cutting off sectors from the map and not with the usual shrinking circle. At the end it only matters if you are in the helicopter which leaves the very slight possibility that you might win without killing anyone. The system requirements are very reasonable and the game runs OK most of the time. The whole thing seems to be very well thought out by the developers.What I do not like is the controls. They feel kind of wooden. The shooting also feels off which is my biggest complaint. That being said it is free to play and I haven't noticed any pay to win mechanics so it gets my approval as a whole.",1
69,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is pretty great.  The gameplay is exciting, the graphics are impressive, and it is better with every patch/update.

Fractured Space is a really well put together game and the Devs are easily accesible.      The game has done nothing but increase in quality and a large player pool would be amazing.",1
14884,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Owner is too greedy, devs are clueless, staff is incompetent (because of the owner).It looks like a good game, and it is a good game just before you start noticing how bad it is managed and the potential lost on it.It may become good miraculously in the future, but I doubt it will. They already have a solid userbase to milk money from, and it seems like they are ok to keep the game as it is.",0
14644,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2015.0,"Lord of the Rings Online.. Is it good or bad? I would have to say this is a generally good game. This game is very much your typical mmorpg game. The controls are very simple and easily understood. You spend most of your time in third person observing your character, combat involves locking onto a target, then clicking (or using a hotkey) to trigger the different attacks that are displayed on your action bar. Area attacks do exist, and generally the physics play out reasonably well. The World: The world is big. There is plenty of places to explore, and the graphical level is pleasing to look at. While it will not match up in freedom of movement, or detail to Skyrim, it is definitely a fun place to view and explore. At first the world will seem pretty small, it is only as you go along that the distances between locations grow to the point where it is unpleasant to travel there by foot. They did, however, do a good job of matching up when distances get long, with when you your character can get a horse. In summary: medium-big world that is aesthetically very pleasing to look at. Questing: The questing system is very closed. You progress through them, some of them are voiced, most only have one or two lines of voiced dialogue the rest you have to read on your own, you rarely have any options. They do not support the player choosing to be evil or good, or making choices that will have impacts upon how the quest will progress. Despite the limited nature of it, they did a fairly good job of making stories that are interesting, and that fit with the lore of Middle Earth. Summary: lack of player options, but decently entertaining anyhow.Characters: Character setup is highly limited. You can choose from four races (Dwarf, Elf, Hobbit Man). Then you have a group of Classes;[some titles may be wrong] Guardian, Champion, Burglar, Warden, Rune-Keeper, Hunter, Captain and Lore Master. The races share the classes, with a few classes being disabled for each race (for example no Dwarf Burglars, or Human Rune Keepers. Each class also has three 'paths' that they can follow, those will effect what kinds of weapons they will be good at, and how well your character is at solo play. In general, there is almost no cross-over between classes, and no way to change once you make your character, so research well before you make a choice. Crafting: There is almost nothing to talk about here. You choose a craft that contains three skills. Some skills let you gather, others let you craft. No single craft you can choose is completely self-reliant, so you will need the help of friends or the general world market to level up all of your skills. Crafted weapons are, however, well worth the effort of getting. They are on average far better than what you can find through loot for your level. General play: While this game is termed a ""role-playing game"", there is very little actual role-playing to be found on it. The role-playing servers rarely have players who actually actively try to take on their character's roles. There are some good communities that you can join in with, but if you are on your own do not expect players to be particularly sociable or in character. Outside of role-playing the community is very open and helpful. Questions are typically answered quickly and nicely, and there are almost always players around who are willing to help you out. There are also plenty of player friendly guilds/factions out there to join if you enjoy that kind of play. tl;dr, generic mmorpg, with its biggest highlight being that it is based in Middle Earth.

8840,Magic Duels,2016.0,"I was surprised at how poorly this game was rated here, but apparently there were a lot of problems at launch and major setbacks with updates and patching. Plus a game this iconic and celebrated by its fans is always going to get tons of shade thrown at it by the hardcore/longtime crowd. However, I'm brand new to MTG in general as well as the digital doppelgangers (I also bought Magic 2014 DOTP Gold Complete on sale just prior to trying this out). I don't own a single paper card nor have I ever played any version of Magic, so I was a Magic virgin going into this (pun intended, nerds). As of 2/22/16, this is a pretty good game. In fact, it's a great game for two types of gamers:1. People new to Magic (me).2. Casual/Mobile gamers (not me).I highlighted that part as the TL;DR version, but I'll add this: If you are new to Magic, this is probably the best possible way to learn. The tutorial/story mode is very well done and the interface is very clean, intuitive, and looks like it belongs in 2016.Update on 3/10/16: There are some critical bugs in certain parts of the game, but the devs are serious about Duels going forward for at least two years. It probably won't ever compare to MTGO, but this will be the perfect intro for new players, in a perfect platform for it, free and accessible. Seriously, you can pretty much ignore most reviews from last year. The farming is opened up, you get more coins for everything, and the gold cap resets every 12 or 24 hours like the quests. It's not hard to amass cards if you can play an hour or so a day. My monored aggro (farming) deck usually beats the AI in 5-6 turns. Disable all the fancy animations and such, and a game can end in minutes. That definitely makes the AI look stupid (and it is sometimes), but the complaint about farming was repeated a lot a few months back.",1

You can have up to 3 characters and there are 3 factions to choose from. Each faction has their own type of weapons and vehicles. The game is very fun to play with friends and it is totally possible to play this game for free. But if you do want to spend 5 dollars or somethingn there are some DLC packs that give you more guns camos and etc. It is a solid game and its free so you really don't have much to lose when trying this out. It is a solid game and a blast when you get some friends together.,1
10126,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2017.0,"Short Version: This isn't the real deal, 4000 LP and FOUR card spots? This is dumbed down beyond belief, this is NOT yu-gi-oh, it's a bad port for a mobile cash-grab that looks like the original card game animated series.More details:1) Bad port: you can't play this in full screen. Even if you alt+enter (as suggested in their official FAQ, lol) you'll get the windows bar on the bottom cutting the screen. No way to resize the window, either.2) Grindy beyond belief. I know it's F2P, and that it's a card collecting game, you're kinda supposed to buy card packs, but even before you can unlock more advanced features of the game, you have to defeat the same basic AI opponents hours upon hours, after the first hour I just said no, I've got better things to do.3) Returning to the ""not the original Yu-Gi-Oh!"" point you can see that even in their marketing model: card packs give you 4 cards, as opposed to the standard 7 that you bought back in the day, this flawed digital ""version"" of the game is even more expensive than the real life one.There used to be a free project that gave you everything you needed to play the real Yugi, digitally ofc, online and offline, and included good AI as well, but apparently they've all been taken down by the Konami ♥♥♥♥wits for....whatever this lil'♥♥♥♥♥♥is.Negative recommendation because Konami takes down good, free projects in order to give us bad, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cashgrabs.",0

The grind for one is, well, big even for an ""MMO"". It's only worse for tanks and I'm going to go ahead and assume ships will be just as bad. Just for an example, you need about 50-55k rp for the Tiger H1. You're lucky to get more than 2k rp a game in Realistic Battles without premium. I've literally had 10+ kill games with battle activity of 90%+ and only got 2.3k rp in ground forces rb.As for the random BS that happens, just google images of the il-2 ground attacker.

1090,Realm of the Mad God,2014.0,"Don't be fooled by 68 hours, My main account most likley has several hundred hours of gameplay. This game offers so much, but it's rather difficult to get into, while being incredibly easy to get in to. Starting the game and exploring is fun and you can do it from day one, at first glance it's a fun game, but nothing you'd spent much time on. Now If you look past that, there is actually so much. The leveling system isn't what determines a character. Maxed stats are. In game ""potions"" are used as a sort of currency in the trading economy, along with gear and other items. These potions are obtained by defeating difficult enemies and completeing certain dungeons.  To problem is, getting this far takes practice, detrmination and grit. Death is inevitable, dont let it set you back. Learning how to rebound from deaths becomes an integral feature as you make characters that are more and more powerful. Even the most powerful characters who have all 8 stats maxed are prone to quick deaths, the game in unforgiving, and requires skill, but offers much in return for those who deliver.",1

The story arc missions give pretty lousy hands about 50% of the time, where the hand is nearly all lands or all creatures. Not well balanced.

7267,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"I knew this was just a conversion from the mobile application, therefore, my expectations for this game should have been low. It is impossible, however, not to feel some excitement when engaging with new material from the Fallout universe - and excitement walks hand-in-hand with high expectations. Fortunately, Fallout Shelter has, to a great extent, met those expectations. Why? This game is so simple to play, which makes it perilously addictive. Everything can be controlled with just the mouse. For instance, to assign vault dwellers to specific roles, you just drag and drop them to SPECIALised rooms. That’s right, the pun was intended. Your vault dwellers have the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system, just like Fallout, and some of the rooms have a preferred S.P.E.C.I.A.L.s. The Science Lab required high Intelligence, for example. While it isn’t compulsory to adhere to the assigned S.P.E.C.I.A.L., doing-so will make you vault dweller very happy; and happiness, as you will find, is very important. The rooms of your vault, weapons and armour will be limited in the beginning, but your options quickly grow with the growth of your vault’s population, which can be increased in two ways: you can build a Radio Studio to attract dwellers from the Wasteland, or, in a more novel way, assign a male and female dweller to a Living Quarters, then sit-back, and let the amorous spectacle commence. Fortunately, for those sick-minded individuals out there, the game won’t let you force incest, or exile a pregnant dweller. As for the graphics, they are, of course, basic, but not repulsive or retro-feeling. In fact, the endearing Vault Boy cartoon-style pervades the game and makes each dweller quite endearing. The power armour suits, though, look a little compressed, and a little too comical.  The replay value of the game is somewhat limited, which, of course, is because Fallout Shelter was intended to be the launch-pad for Fallout 4. This is evident in the missions, which, after incorporating some witty dialogue in keeping with the Fallout universe, fail to vary and challenge the player: the management in combat is limited, the same half-a-dozen locations become dreary, and the enemies equally so. In short, the missions can become something to run in the background, in order to gain revenue, whilst being more attentive to another task in your Internet browser. Overall, this game is definitely worth playing, but only if you looking for a bit of light-hearted fun. The serious gaming, and long-term gaming, remains with Fallout 4, or for more avid Fallout fans, like myself, Fallout: New Vegas.  ",1

The beginning of the game is very fun and exciting, drawing you in with the promise of better looking blueprints that get more badass as time goesd on. The game does begin to slow down really quick in the mid-game. I am still in the mid-game stage with all the hours I have, but I have found that when I'm waiting on another game to download or waiting for a friend, I can hop on real quick and start on a blueprint. The game is double the fun when you can find a bunch of people to connect with and raid with, giving the game longer vitality with players.

16098,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWell, I'm sorry to say that the developers have managed to wreck what was one of my favorite games. 1. The new battle mode is lame. I am not interested in blasting cubes off of towers. I want to engage enemy bots. Yes, I know that is still ""part"" of the game, but is should be the only part. I think it would work much better to simply have zone control based on sole occupation of areas (similar to world of tanks). Also having too many modes has caused crazy long que times. What used to take 5 - 20 seconds to join a match, now can take 15 minutes.2. The developers have decided that components that are higher tier should not be placed on lower tier bots. This has essentially ruined all my bot designs and makes the game (bot design and game play) very cookie cutter.

19391,Magic Duels,2015.0,"I really want to like it, but I just can't.  The duels of the planeswalkers series has always tooled it's UI with a focus on speed over usability and that continues.  problems like trying to tap the right mana for your first spell so you can cast a second spell afterwards, and assigning damage to blockers remain obtuse to find solutions to (my 4/4 was blocked by 2 2/2s and did all 4 damage to one of them).Like I said though, none fo that is *new* to this series.  This one is also FTP, which means you start with a small collection of cards and are encouraged to buy packs (which only have 6 cards to make building a reasonable collection even harder), but I've played plenty of FTP games I was expecting some somewhat shady mechanisms for trying to get paid, so that *also* didn't scare me off either.The nail in this coffin for me was the ""deck wizard"".  let me break it down for you.  Imagine an incredibly inept deck building wizard that works basically like the hearthstone Arena deck constructor.  ""here are a few cards with this theme, add one to your deck"", except now imagine that those decks are considered ""constructed"" and sent to play against real constructed decks.

13093,Infestation: The New Z,2018.0,"This is a game that over reaches on just about every aspect and then falls flat on its face.Recently, I was persuaded to install this game and play online with my son. However during the two and a half hour stream, throughout the game, despite the fact that I did enjoy playing with my son, I voiced just how disappointed I was with this game, from the narrative, to the gameplay to the visuals, it looked more like a poor man's DayZ, which is saying a lot as that game by itself is very poorly optimized, but is still an awesome game.Narrative.What narrative? I have come across some very basic games in the past and each and every single one of them has some form of narrative, even if it is just an explanation of the game. This one has nothing.The game is based on a post apocalyptic world that is now overrun by zombies. That is about as far as the narrative goes. Yet as you will read on, the game has a lot of potential, but because of the lack of attention to detail, well... if the narrative is anything to go by, don't expect much else.Visuals.the game as a whole has some elements that you can see in other games, most notably, the Arma/DayZ game. The problem is, you get the distinct impression that the development team just don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥One of the biggest problems I have with the visuals is the 'Draw Distance'. Some of you may know the specs of my streaming/gaming pc that I use, as I regularly stream other games, at maximum graphical setting so you get the best stream possible to watch. Despite the fact my PC is more than capable, this game is just terribly optimised. The draw distance in this game is ridiculous. You get the high quality textures for about 10 feet in front of your character, then you get the low quality textures after that, and combined with the poor texture optimisation, that same 10 feet is where you get all the game assets in visual range, anything beyond this, some of the assets simply disappear. This problem can be seen on any map, in any server at any time.Another issue is the poor quality of the 'better quality textures' and the models used in the game. The buildings for the most part can not be entered, which is unusual for a game that is based on survival, instead we get a box with a texture. For the buildings you can enter, they are very empty, with no furniture, chairs, kitchens.... not even rubbish. Just the odd pick up every now and then.The models and animations used for the zombies and even your character are very sub par. The zombies animations look more comical than scary as they tend to bounce towards you with both hands in the air. Your character models are also something not to be admired. In first person mode, the hands some times do not match up with the weapon you are holding. Certain wearable items you can collect are laughable, as depending on what character you have selected/created there hair, jacket will show through the item you picked up.Another part that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off was the maps themselves as there is very little attention to detail put into the maps. The more prominent problem is the amount of assets that are left suspended in mid air. Grass, rocks, some trees, vehicles, and I even seen a building or two that were above the ground.You get the distinct impression that the developers took no pride in creating the game as a whole and rushed it. Overall, it looks like it was created with an old Unity Game Engine using stock assets. With such obvious laziness in the visual side of the game, it is hard to find anything good to say about it.If it was designed using an older game engine, there is no excuse for the ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥visuals. You have to take into consideration that this game is less than 2 years old, and looks as though some dude in his mom's basement made this game in his spare time. But I suspect there is more to this, and that is revealed in the gameplay.Gameplay.Poor.When you first start the game, there is a basic character creation tool that is very limited in options, and that is for a very good reason. If you want something different, you have to pay..... yes the game game has micro transactions and is completely littered with them. Yes it is a free game to play but if you want to win, you have to pay.... so not only is it full of unnecessary micro transactions, it is a pay to win system, which puts it in the same category of♥♥♥♥♥♥games along with Battlefront II.When you play the ''survivor'' mode, you select/create your character, and when you join a server, you have to go around and hunt for pickups, from a larger backpack that can hold more items, to armour, weapons, food, drinks, bandages among other useless items that have no bearing on the game. So not bad, but when you take into account that other people have simply paid for a backpack, sniper, armour and other stuff before they even entered the map, it takes the fun out of it instantly as it is no longer an even playing field.What is worse is the fact that when you die, instead of re-spawning back on the same map, you are kicked out of the server and taken back to the lobby. And guess what... your character can not be revived for about 10 minutes, forcing you to create another character, and this is directly linked to the micro transaction side, as those that do spend, when they inevitably get killed, they can not take all them items for that character and transfer them onto the other, so if you do want that awesome sniper, armour or backpack before you jump back into the game, you will have to buy them all over again. Are you seeing a pattern yet?When you are in game, it is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying as hell. With the servers being very light on population, and the maps being as big as they are, you can run for an hour and not meet or see anyone. The same can be said about items for you to pick up. And those that have paid for weapons in advance, will simply sit there and snipe you before you even pick up a thing after an hour of roaming around. As I said earlier, pay to win.The size of the maps is of course one problem, but another is the vehicles. Yes they can make roaming around faster, but when a troop transporter/tank can get hung up on a chain link fence, or be knocked back by a zombie, it is ultimately a waste of an asset that doesn't work as it should.Something that is very laughable is the hit boxes on the zombies themselves. You can shoot next to there head, and it will register as a head shot, yet sometimes, if you shoot them dead in the chest, it wont register a hit at all.And this I don't understand in the slightest. I came across a sort of ''super zombie'' that is double the size of all the other NPC's, faster than you and apparently, unkillable. I stood on top of a tank where it could not hit me, and I emptied all my ammo into its head and it would not die. I don't see the point of it, and it takes all what is left of the fun this game had, if any, and pours it down the drain. It stopped the game dead for me, and I was left exposed, unable to move or do anything without being killed and having to start all over again.Conclusion.The game looks as though it was rushed, with the worst possible game engine, but crammed full of micro transaction to cash in on the Zombie craze that is coming back and the Battle Royal craze that has hit many other games. It is a game designed for one reason and one reason only... get rich quick.It is a game that is disappointing in every single aspect, and there is not one redeemable point you can take away from the game that makes it seem less♥♥♥♥♥♥than what it is.1/10Just don't wast your time looking for it, let alone downloading it from the steam store, you will be sorely disappointed with it.

In fact, there is a durability system about rifles and grenades (and probably it's the same for the other stuff). So, you have to spend a lot of in-game money.Thirdly, all items, even premium can buy with in-game money. But, it's very very expensive. It's a grinding game.Fourthly and lastly, in game, you have medals (every medals have differents effects, for example: accuracy bonus, agility, endurance etc.).

If you really want to play Minecraft but don’t want to pay for it, get this.It’s a good solid free-to-play game.Its crafting system is detailed. It has a more realistic, cartoony style than Minecraft and for being a free game, it’s really well done. There are creatures to fight, things to build, mines to mine. It’s pretty much a simplified version of the game everyone already knows about. It's also boring and repetitive if you're playing by yourself. But the same can be true for the original game. The best way to play this is with your friends. So gather them up and see how much chaos you can cause each other.  ",1

6595,Paladins®,2016.0,"If you want my honest, modest, humble, lowly, truthful, sincere opinion quite frankly its one of the best if not the best free game I've played.Somewhat like a MOBA style TF2 this game is amazing.It is somewhat Pay to Win but thats expected from a free game, and paying doesnt get you OP weapons, simply unlocks characters faster, and in the end match outcomes come down to skill, not how much money you spend.Has some minor bugs, but thats also expected as at the time of writing its in beta.All in all, a great game!Edit: It's now been a while since I last played. I honestly am not quite sure what the game is exactly like at the current stage as I havn't been keeping up with the patches. I would still reccommend this game and I hope this review is still accurate of the game in its current stage.",1
349,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"The opinions about this game kinda crashing together.All I can really tell you is try it for yourself. In about a week or smth this game is going to be free to play.In my opinion the issues with botters, gold sellers and performance is real but nothing what is kinda different to other MMOs I played. And there is a patch incoming with allowing for better trade options and so on, so they are working to improve the game.There is stuff which could be better, like the social part of this game. In most cases you walk either with a friend or alone. But the gameplay itself is very polished, there are tons of classes/builds and skills to combine, I really love that system (kinda like ArcheAge but you have to circle through 7 classes).To give you a small sum up:PROS:- Tons of classes to choose and develop- Ragnarok similar art style modernized- Really awesome controller support (play it with a PS4 controller), feels like playing Breath of Fire 4.- For a F2P game there is atm. not much to call it pay to win, there is actually just one item which gives you great benefits but you are able to buy it with the ingame currency from players.- Even thou the maps are a bit linear, there are many and big one, so it fills the gap.- ""Endcontent"" Earth Tower which is comparable to Sword Art Online's Castle, you have to climb up and as far as I know the highest level reached is 20 so far (I could be wrong with this information)- No real level cap, the soft cap is at around 270 at the moment- Stat point allocation, so many MMOs dropped that system which makes me kinda sad because I had to define my character with equipment only, but not here. There is a good balance betweet equipment stats and the ones you picked.CONS:- Regular performance drops. While I have most of the time 120+fps there are recent drops for like half a second to like 15fps. This really has to be fixed.- The character customization is actually not really existent. You can choose boy/girl and one of like 6 hairstyles. That is kinda lame.- Kill stealing. For me personally this is nothing new because I played Lineage2 for like 8 years, but it is kinda annoying in this generation of MMOs- Bots & Goldseller. While they are annoying, bots are kinda more polite than most players, because they don't kill steal :D- Class balance. There are few classes which really have to get more love, like the summoner for example- Lone wolf MMO, there has to be more social stuff to care about in this game. While I like the public party system (you see parties with open slots nearby) this is not enough. I mean Ragnarok was like a freakin MMODRPG (massive multiplayer online dating role play game), but I don't see it even close here.So why do I recommend this game?You know I started with hundreds of new MMOs and saw how they launched, in most cases it was always chaos and stuff that should be different. Even GW2 had a crap start with hundreds of gold sellers or FFXIV with servers all the time down and queries to the moon for joining the game. With this one it does not feel much different. YES there are issues which needs to be adressed asap, but you can see and play so much content for an inofficial Ragnarok 2.5. Give this game a try and the developers some love and I'm pretty sure you might enjoy it a lot ;)",1
20175,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is literally everything PUBG should have been on launch. This game also has an interesting end-game scenario. Instead of being the last player alive to achieve victory, a Heli flies down and drops a ladder and offers extraction for a total of 4 passengers to escape from the Blizzard. You may think well, that isn't too much fun, players will just camp the ladder up into the heli. That is true, however to keep that playstyle from being abused too much, after a certain amount of time players are revealed on the map forcing a potential extraction or intense  gunfight ( While in PUBG it's whoever can stay prone the longest until you spot a potential kill ). Great idea and for me personally, well executed. It brings some freshness to the genre. Gun play is great too. Also the game is faster than PUBG but it's not over in 10 minutes either it's just the right amount of time. There is so much more but i'll let you all explore this game yourself :) Of Course the game has it's problems too as many do some minor frame drops and lag here and there from what I have experienced but it's not game breaking at all nor a reason not to play it.    *NOTE* I'm comparing this to PUBG because they are so damn similar an many many way's and I feel this game does it all 1,000 times better.

Then suddenly Queue times in OCE stop working alltogether overnight, and queue times during the day instead of taking 10-30 seconds you can wait for upwards of 5 minutes EASY every game. CAN WE NOT? Splitting the playerbase is killing smaller regions, and we aint even that small but your queue times have more than quadrupled. The matches you DO get are full of complete saltiness instead of the prior mild salt, probably due to long term players being unhappy with the state of the game. The future looks like you want to head into pay to win, and you guys at Hi-rez know how quickly two of your games died out after you patched for pay to win schemes. Those patches were pretty much the heat death of your universe in that game, and you obliterated your player bases. This gunna be the 3rd or you gunna listen to community feedback and FIX IT.The game ontop of that, is further pushing people into playing their mains because thats what they have all their cards for further decreasing the amount of support players and frontlines because half of your playerbase are angry 12 year olds who all want to play DPS and expect the next person to hold the torch.All bar ONE thing you said the OB64 was brought here for, is actually doing and will continue to do the exact opposite you hoped for.

This is a free game, whether you liked it or not, remember that it did not take $10 + to find that out, i personally love it, and i know what this company is capable of, i have been playing their games for a long time and would play the weekly releases at the end of every friday and let me tell you Adventure Quest 3D is coming along nicely, yes for the time being is boring if you have done everything there is, just like any game becomes boring after you have done everything.They're working on making the starter areas not grindy anymore and expand upon the story, as well as its many promissed assets such as pets and pvp which i was told that is coming before release, this game launches on october 13, 2017 and it is still in beta, and like i said whether you think its bad or good it did not take any money to find that out, and for that it gets all my praise and recommendation for it even more so when you actually realize this game can actually be played in your Android and Iphone device as well as on a mac or laptop or computer, which in it of itself is a pretty neat feature.If you want infinite bragging rights and just joined this game, hurry and get your beta berserker armor!! do not miss this 1 of a kind opportunity to own 1 of the rarest armors in game unlike alpha knight, and alpha pirate which are no longer available + on release day there is a surprise for every player whether you joined just now or whether you've been on the AQ3D first ever techdemo  more then 3 years ago, there are rewards for everyone on release day as long as you created and played on your account before release day. Definitely recommend",1
14787,AdventureQuest 3D,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewTrying to recommend this game is trying to tell me that I should kill my Palico on Monster Hunter World: It's impossible.Many of Artix Entertainment's adventures into Lore have been interesting, from the ever-nostalgic AdventureQuest, to the dragon-infested DragonFable, to a Lore where every kid who can't PvP uses Void Highlord on AdventureQuest Worlds. Now we have the most linear and most boring of these Lore adaptations, not to mention the most toxic of communities.I started playing, got the name Chronicle, got the Chronomancer set, and I was happy not spending any money on the game. Reached the graveyard where everyone else was struggling, and regardless of the many people that are in the area, nobody was interested in helping each other. I do admire, to a full extent, of AE's intention to pull away from the ease of doing everything yourself, to relying constantly on teamwork to push through. While this would normally work, it doesn't when everyone you meet is a constant jerk. Even some of the most recognisable faces in AQ3D would rather brag about what items they have over helping the newer players who haven't a clue. It's become so biased and it's hasn't had a long full release yet.Let's not mention a lie that has doomed the game from the very start. It had been started that ""as we have always said, micro-currency will never pay-to-win power but will be used to (among other things) save time"", which was intended for the crafting system, but the rest of the game is reliant on being as rich as a guy with a Burning Flames Team Captain on TF2 just to catch up from level 1 without missing out. The kickstarter rewards, not to mention, are nonsensical. Instead of physical items that can be souvenirs from a time where you provided monetary assistance to get the game out, you're instead treated to virtual items that may/may not provide a headstart to a game that was meant to be free of the P2W stigma. Instead, they've since welcomed it. It's the typical Steam MMO we hoped it wouldn't be.It's such a shame. As Artix von Krieger's friend and fan, I'm utterly disappointed with how AQ3D turned out. Sad to say, there's no way to fix it.",0

I get it, the German tanks can't be invincible and the game needs to remain competitive. But if the way of balancing the game out is to breakdown historical accuracy, then you're just admitting that you are being bias. Russian tanks were inferior to German engineering, that's why a Tiger takes up all of your spawn points in a realistic battle. If Gaijen is all about historical accuracy, why don't they fix this?

You either draw way too many resource cards but no units to spend them on, or no resources at all. The amount of games where a 1/1 minion has slowly whittled down me/the opponent is absurd.

11697,Path of Exile,2015.0,"It’s not so much the gameplay that is challenging, but your knowledge of the game itself that challenges you. There are many nuances in the game that you have to learn. First the vocabulary. For example: ""5% increased damage"" is very different from ""5% more damage"". And because of this don’t expect to make that perfect char your first go. Especially if you don’t follow a guide. This isn't really a bad thing, but it is not friendly to new players.What is bad are the tags they put on skills. They basically mean nothing. For example ""rain of arrows"" is a skill that has the projectile tag, but a projectile support skill will not affect this skill. Such as “Greater/lesser projectiles” do absolutely nothing to this skill. It's like GGG wants it to be confusing just because they can make it confusing. I don’t see any other reason for it. It’s why a totem skill can have the tag spell, but things that effect spells don’t effect it. So they make the learning curve even more stupid. And if you go post this as a bug on the forums. You just get trolled and yelled at for being an idiot.The point of the game is to make the most OP character you can. I enjoy doing this, and is the reason I started to play the game. However; even if you succeed in making a character work the way you wanted it too. Don’t expect it to last. GGG has been constantly removing build options. The build diversity has gone way down sense the game first released. And you may not even be able to play your character even remotely close to the way you did before. There is way more to this then simply nerfing stuff. If it was a simple nerf and the build still worked I wouldn’t put this in the review.GGG is on a never ending quest to balance the game. As if things HAVE to be balanced. Meaning anything main stream or popular gets nerfed. In 1.3 it was block. In Awakening it was life leach, and auras. And many other things. Anyways; the point of nerfs where to balance things. But there not balancing things. They are removing options. If block just became less OP instead of them removing most of the different ways of getting it. I would have been ok with it. But the truth is they can’t really balance defensive vs offensive skills. If you want an explanation on that read here http://www.diabloii.net/blog/comments/mad-prophecies-2-defensive-skills But in GGG’s quest to balance these, they instead have made it so you need multiple defensive things going instead of one.For example Chaos damage. Chaos damage has its own special rules. It bypasses your energy shield for free. Is the hardest defensive of stat to get in the game, and it is very punishing on specific builds. For some builds the only way around it is to hope for a supper rare, and expensive item drop. Recently GGG has upped the item’s drop rate. But it doesn’t really help you get the item if your build needs it. As many maps will just give you snakes or something that does Chaos damage. Even after you re-rolled the map just to avoid the mod of poison damage. This means you’re never going to get the item you need without buying it.GGG has nerfed a defensive stat out of oblivion every major patch. Currently the only real strategy defensively that works is DPS. Yep you just got to get so much DPS you can, and kill everything before it hits you.Patches are a big problem for existing characters. For example: Reduce Mana used to work on auras. But in the awakening patch... Reduced Mana changed so it wouldn’t work with auras or similar gems. They then took the enlightened gem and made it do what reduced mana used to do. This is a huge problem for existing builds. The biggest problem being the color of gem changing. Many people might have corrupted their gear, and can’t change the color gem sockets anymore. Meaning your once level 100 character is now all messed up gear and gems. GGG just expects you to level a new guy. And when they mess up your character they don’t let you redo in game key choices. Like the bandit reward choice. They only give you a passive re-spec. And that is only because they change the passive tree so much. It is usually impossible to leave your old tree in tack.That is my biggest gripe of this game. Many people like this. They think it keeps the game fresh. But for many others... GGG is just destroying builds constantly patch after patch. And you as the player you are just expected to deal with it. Builds come and go. I don’t see this changing, and it will just continue be so. Until the least popular build is the only viable one. Meaning any work you put into creating a build will go to waste. Even if the build isn't that good.GGG don’t like specific build so much that they have over tuned their bosses and other things. For example: They didn’t like life leach so much that they made it so bosses can one shot you. There reason for this is because they don’t want you to take a hit and just be able to heal back up for free. So how do players get around this? There are two options. One is make your char supper mobile and avoid the hit all together. Or make your char supper tanky enough to survive the hit and then life steal back up. That’s right in there attempt to punish a specific build they made it pretty much one of the only viable builds. This just goes to show you that the people in charge of balance at GGG have no clue what they are doing.Also patch changes are not announced before they happen either. However; beta/test realm testers get to play with the changes before anyone else. And most of the major changes can be found in the form of rumors. But the actual patch notes come the same day as the patch. Leaving many builds broken in their wake. And forum jerks going around telling people they had plenty of time to prepare. This gives beta testers a big advantages in many different areas of the game. Like what items to buy, or sell based off upcoming nerfs/buffs. Even way before the patch notes, let alone the patch release. But the biggest annoyance is the race events. Right after a huge major patch like the awakening. They will offer prizes. Such as a laptop to the first person to kill the new boss. They highly show favoritism to a few select people. Weather they realize it or not. So if you don't cheat and are not able to play on the test servers. Then don't expect to win anything. EVER!!!Most people will be happy; until the next patch comes out, and your character is completely gutted again. Because of this I don’t recommend picking up any of the bandit rewards. Just kill all 3. It leaves you with more flexibility; for when the next patch does come out. And don’t spend money on the game. It’s not a matter of “if they will” but “when they will” destroy your current character/build. Very few builds survive from patch to patch. One of the patches actually de-leveled your gems for you. (Yep GGG said you know all those corrupted high level gems you had. Well too bad you have to make new ones now.) This is a game where patches are your worst nightmare.Other things to note are: PVP go ranged or loose. Don’t expect to do groups/parties. The reward isn’t worth the penalties that come with it. Don’t ever corrupt stuff except for gems. Because gems change not just in stats, but in color too. Meaning you will most likely be leveling new ones anyways.Also avoid the forums. GGG will lock your game account for what you say in the forums. Not just your forum account, if they don’t like what you say. This is 100% true. You don’t have to believe me. Just read their terms of use. They locked my account for over a year because they didn't like this review. I originally wrote it on their website, and had to move it here later. It was a Big mistake!",0

10543,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI think this game has a lot of potential, there are many (features) that have to come. Aq3d is just not finished yet and there is still quite some work. With the passion of AE, I think it really can be something, the game feels much better than closed beta especially in the combat section. Death animations and small changes help a lot, also the fact that the game is striving for weekly updates which is very nice and you can play it on your mobile phone which is really awesome. I just hope that they change the UI for pc, I have talked with the devs and they said they will go check it out. Especially their animator korin which has the same idea's as I. In there newest update on the game they address on some important things like the UI for pc and combat which is amazing and i am so happy they wil (try) to do something about it.(DUTCH)Ik vind dat dit game veel potentie heeft, er zijn veel (features) die moeten komen. Aq3d is gewoon nog niet af en er moet nog wat flink aan gewerkt worden. Met de passie van AE denk ik dat het echt iets kan worden, de game voelt veel better dan closed bèta vooral in de combat. Death animations en kleine veranderingen helpen veel, ook het feit dat de game graag weekly updates wil is heel fijn en dat je het op je mobiel kan spelen is ook fijn. Ik hoop alleen dat ze de UI veranderen voor pc, ik heb met de devs gepraat en ze zeiden dat ze erin zullen gaan kijken. Vooral hun animator kori vind dat het veranderde moet worden. Test dit game en als je potentie ziet wacht to winter ;).

2333,Magic Duels,2015.0,"Again wasted potential.In my Opinion MTG is the best TCG to play as a tabletop game and i think it is not only my opinion.I play for half of my life now and i love this game for every moment but it was mostly always a letdown in the videogame versions.Magic Duels didn't get much better.I am not going into detail about the crash and connection problems because there is not much to talk about, it's just bad as it is.Point one, stop babysitting me: Why isn't there an option to diasble the tutorial stuff completely? I am not a Hearthstone fan, but it is ok if hearthstone does this because it appeals to people who never touched a tcg before while magic can too it is mostly veterans who are going to play this game so give these people the option to turn that off.Point two, not enough diversity:Yes this game is partially there to promote the last coreset but come on. I for myself play mostly modern and for a player outside standard this game is a huge letdown. Since the time MTG is around tons of awesome cards were made so let us use them.Point three, Magic has many cool formats so why not building them all in ""good"":They already experimented with different formats in the duels of the planeswalker games but none was done good. There was always some stupid thing to it. WHY THE HELL SHOULD I PAY FOR SEALED SLOTS AFTER I PAID MONEY FOR THE GAME?!(Dues of the Planeswalker).This game didn't try to really improve any of these formats or even implement them, what the hell WotC?Those were my major issues with this game now let's see what actually improved:Point one, yeah no more new version every year:Yes they acutally are going to add more coming cards to it without having to spend another 13 bucks on a new game and unlocking everything from the beginning again and again.Point two, smoother gameplay:The game got faster and smoother than his predecessor's which leads to better gameplay overall.Yeah that's pretty much it already about the good points of the game.Last i'd like to say a couple words about the additional card system:Yes you can invest actual money in it or spend a huge amount of time playing with a nonfunctional deck until it can be called somewhat of a deck with actual strategie behind it. Hearthstone does this too from what i know and i can't really say it's a bad way to do this but it's not the right thing for me. I would never pay money to get digital cards when i can spend my money on real cards which i use in real life playing with my friends on kitchen table or at stores and meet new people there.So overall i can't really recomment this game in it's current state.If you are new to magic then it's a real good game to start learning since the tutorials are going to help you as a new player and you don't have to pay for anything. On the other hand, it's not a very good game for veterans. You get bored fast and see a lot of flaws in evey corner.",0
6876,Star Trek Online,2014.0,"STO is a very well executed space MMORPG. The story is relatively engaging for an MMO, and the graphics are nice. If you are even a little bit of a trekkie, there is a great deal of fun to be had here.That said, like most MMOs, it gets samey rather fast. It takes longer than most, which is something I really have to give the developers a great deal of kudos for, but eventually, you're going to feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again. Something that helps combat this is that it has the concept of user-created missions. You can actually get on a special account type and create missions for others to play. These range from the awesome to the ""meh"", and is another unique feature to STO.The fact that this is free to play, and the paid addons are reasonable, makes it definitely one of the better MMO's out there.

The offers in this game are very cheap compared to other pay to win games. Also, if you're a new player, I would reccomend using PC and not mobile. It's much easier to control your ships using a mouse. I would also reccomend to be cautous about increasing your base experiance. Try minimizing the amount of damage on your base with your layout. Bases aren't entirely built to defend early on. Other than that, don't count on getting the latest content early on. That's right, don't. Focus on getting to the next tier instead.

Also not being able to dodge and the 'lag attacks' makes it annoying.The stuff in the cash shop is just crap.Also when your party is at a dungeon 'teleporting/summoning' there will costs real life money.And then the market is already ruined, due to a dupe bug which was in all previous versions... the economy = ruined.Early access means nothing in this case, it's from 2012... if they didn't fix the issues in the last 6 years... they won't.",0

2136,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2013.0,"I am a fan of this game but that won't stop me from saying the truth. This is an mmo set in Middle Earth, and that's where this game differentiates from World of Warcraft. It has the same combat and quest types and similiar graphic styles. I'm not saying it's bad, hell it's the best mmo I have ever played, but that doesn't change the fact that if you have played WOW then you have played this game. However, this game is set in the Lord of the Rings world with the armours and lore that makes the world so original. If you are done with the current MMO hotkey style gameplay and are looking for a new type of game than go ahead and skip this one, but if you are thirsting for a new mmo, havent played WOW, or if you are just generally interested in the LOTR world then go ahead and download this game and get immersed in one of the best stories created.Updated for Badge",1

All money you can potentially spend is on cosmetics and stash (if you want more or a dedicated currency stash tab that holds much bigger stacks).  If you like it, it is worth supporting them as they have made an enjoyable game that never hounds you to spend money.  One playthrough will take around 20-25 hours (to get through the original 3 acts), but they have added up to chapter 10 now, so who knows how long it takes now.The biggest difference with this game as opposed to other action RPGS is that the skill you have are tied to gems that you pick up and then slot into armor/weapons.  These gems level up by you using them.  You can unslot them and then reslot other gems as you see fit (they maintain their levels).  This allows you to really experiment with builds while not being restricted to specific skills or armor.Just give it a go.

18391,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2018.0,"Game Review:     Mechanics are fun and different. The story, verses, solo, ladder, and AI modes are all fun and make the game unique. There are also special events that happen to change up some of the arena play.   It is an easy Card Game to get into.  If you like the Elder scrolls Universe then it is a must play.  If you are not familiar with the Elder Scrolls universe it is still a good CCG to play. Personal Feelings:Don't do it. Unless you like losing.  Honestly, it was fun at first. It seemed as if the win rate was about 60% for me. I have only spent $25.00 worth of real money to get some decks, otherwise I've used in game coins to buy some of the dark brotherhood.  Recently it seems something has changed. Not sure what exactly but now my win rate is about 15%.   It seems as if the pairing and RNG for card draw is against everything I try.  It is like I'm falling more and more behind those who have all the right cards. I'm not saying everyone has bought all the cards but sometimes I wonder if the game is purposly pushing me into a cornor so I feel like I need to buy decks (like keeping track of how much I've spent).I don't like games that make me feel like I have to buy the in-game content to have fun. Like another Negative review stated ""extremely difficult spike"".   I wish there were two servers: One for those who've spent less than $30.00 of real money and another for those who spent more.I cannot recommend this game to anyone who dosen't wish to pay-to-catchup with the rest of the TES:L community. It is a competitve card game: who's spent more to get the cards.I can recommend this game to those who don't care and know it is a P2W scheme. ",0
1491,Digimon Masters Online,2016.0,"IT'S♥♥♥♥♥♥The only reason this game still exists is because it has ridden the coat tails of the Digimon name and branding as hard as possible. Which is acceptable because that is all Digimon is, a advertisement disgused as a cartoon show designed to push toys.That doesn't mean Digimon isn't cool, my simple capitalist child brain loves the Agumon and the Monmon (remember him?!) and the Pikachumon (It's gonna happen!). This games biggest flaw is that it almost, almost, gets it right but then just falls short! Its close to digimon world 1 on the original playstation but your pet never dies, never needs feeding and never poops. Already this game sounds like a huge improvement. Except the training gym is gone, you never digivolve and the translation is horrible.And the story that you can read, makes no sense! Observe; We have to get away from the bad guys, quick <insert starter digimon> lets go this way! Oh no they have us cornered! ""What do you want Mr Villian man?!"" ""Join us, or else I will ask you to join us, again!"" ""Well I guess we join you"". Believe it or not that was basically the start of the game only written better! The in game dialogue says and I quote ""What do you want? Oh well I guess we join you, I'm so confused"". All of that, in one sentence! And its not even like the 'villian?' can't talk, its just the translation is a mess so our hero answers the 'villian?' before even being asked a question.You will notice that I question the usage of villian as well because despite being setup as the badguy, they have no name and perform nothing of a villianous nature except that they WANT US TO STOP STEALING THEIR DIGIMON which makes us the criminal.I know I am harking on about this one point and that is because the game is a cash shop grind fest and that is the rest of my review summed up in one line.

3208,Dungeon Defenders II,2017.0,"Early Access Review Dungeon Defenders II  review:Dungeon Defenders II. The sequel to Dungeon Defenders I. Last game, the focus was a Tower Defence with First-Person Combat on the side. This game, it's the opposite. It's a mix of Sanctum 2, and a bland MMORPG game. Not necessarily a bad combination, at least in my opinion. You can either go in, collecting and equipping items only for boosting your damage, instead of focusing on the other aspect of the game, Tower Defence. Towers, they do not do as much as would seem viable for a game which has them as one of the two subjects. Only barricades are actually needed. You can go into a match and be able to just place a few walls here and there, on chokepoints or in corridoors, then take out the whole enemy squadron using nothing but your 'Wizardly Stick of Purple Flames and♥♥♥♥♥♥. Or, well, that's my experience. You can have geat on yourself to only help make your Towers and Defences more powerful. Health. Damage. Range. Speed. Those sorts of upgrades. Minor numbers, however, you will not be seeing a Catapult dealing 203 Octillion damage within 2.7 seconds (approx). You will mainly be using your weapons instead of your skills, too, I actually have forgotten that they even exist in my few latest missions. Unless, well, you are too weak. Then, they will become useful. Otherwise, the damage does not scale too well, my weapons are truly able to take care of all problems. Weapons aside, other parts of the game include:+ Skill Trees.+ Private and Public HUBs.+ Matchmaking system (not the best at all).+ Daily Missions.+ ""First Win"" modifiers.+ NPC merchants.+ A bunch of maps and difficulties.+A Terraria crossover.- Not much endgame content.- A really bad UI in the Inventory menu, especially trying to sell all your loot.- Inventory being spammed by items which were useless, even 5 levels below.The RPG element, it's... Satisfactory. Put the bar, well, not too high though. It's not yet finished and the minor flaws, are a lot in number. The gameplay, though repetitive, it is alright enough for me to carry on a little longer. I recommend playing with a friend, however, as the matchmaking system is, well, about as basic as a stick and stone. Sure, you can say how strong players must be in order to be able to join the lobby, but there's not much else to it. But, the levelling and progression aren't that great or a real ""wow cool"" moment. They're more of an ""ok..."" moment. You can't care less. Especially while you're in a mission, and reach a certain level when you unlock something new, then there's this huge black box which takes up a lot of the screen. Disturbing. Unneeded. The weapons, I have mixed feelings about. There should be a way to filter things when in your inventory, from best to worst. Or, only let us have collected some real goodies instead of the same trashy ring from level 2 or so we still get on one of these endgame missions, for whatever reason. Just, let us have the useful gear when we need it. Not some OP gear before we reach that level. Not some weapon which deals feathercuts in terms of damage. Endgame. Endgame. What do you mean, endgame? There is not much endgame. There is repeating missions, however. But no real endgame. There's harder difficulties. Those are fine. But something which is just unfairly difficult but actually accomplishable, is not. I want to feel I have done enough Radiation damage to take out a good 20x15x30xkm blast in the planet, while I am trying to survive with all of my thoughts and mind on the task. Something which is a real kicker. You either are dying all the time, or only die because you fell off the map because of the very slippery movement. Not much inbetween. Either Zeus or a peasent. The closest experience to such a thing in Dungeon Defenders II is going to be a Nightmare mode mission, or the gear, or the pets. This brings me onto my next point: pets. It's an RPG. There will be pets. You can either buy pet eggs using paid currency, or find them from some more difficult and later missions in the game, then hatch those eggs. There's different eggs, each bringing a different theme of creature. From dragons to cats. All pets have their own powers, damage types, rarities, really what you could expect. They're not too great when  you first get them. Their at their hatchling/junior stage, and have not been evolved or powered up in any way. This costs time, and money. The latter is not a problem at all, as you can easily grind a ton of gold within 2 hours. I have actually not needed to grind for gold at any stage in the game so far, actually. In order to evolve your pet, you must first fill up its 'Affection' bar, which is how often or how much you've been using that pet in missions. After the evolution, your pet will grow up a bit, changing the looks and stats. It's a simple system but I don't mind it at all in the game, just seems a bit bland what you could do with a pet, as they do not deal that much damage, though, they are not meant to, they are meant to act as a support for your character.Characters. There's classes: Squire, Monk, Huntress, Apprentice (The main ones), with some others which are more difficult to unlock. Some are more poweful in certain situations than others. The Apprentice has stronger towers than the Squire, however, the trade of lower base HP for them, is the price. The Monk has some powerful towers, such as ones which automatically damage enemies unlucky enough to walk into them. And do they damage. They damage a ton. He also can play a Supportive class as he has a healing tower to help back up your noob teammates if they die too quickly or too often. The Squire is a tank and can deal damage relatively nicely. Just what you could expect. Not much more to talk about. The Huntress is a ranged bow-user. A Ranger or Archer. Good damage. Good range. Overall, the characters are all used for different situations, and they deal with them in different ways.That's all I have for now. Potential. Not yet met.~Wilkowaty",1

10990,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2018.0,"Played forever ago, bought first expansion and packs knowing that a game with the ESL name and polish in the game client would last for a long while. Jumped back in today, new client looks awful. I'm an MTG player and I've got a lot of respect for the folks at Dire Wolf so the change is kind of a double whammy for me. There's no oomph with the client. No feeling of instensity with each new minion added to the board. Compared to other contemporaries, it's just nowhere near their level. I'm not a ""graphics matter"" guy but it's the downgrade for the reasons given (Dire Wolf apparently wasn't making updates and releases at the rate that B wanted).

10104,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat concept, horible execution, devs pratically ignorant to those who don't have a hole in their wallet.I've played this freemium game at 2 different points in time, and I regret re-installation.Teams are balanced against each other, but your teammates often have way more or less power (roughly measured by amount of cpu) than you (ie 400-700 cpu bots in matches with 1500+ cpu bots), meaning you have to recognise who you should run from, and who should to run from you in order for a ""balanced"" match, despite people just attempting to blast anyone into rubble. Sure, you can recycle your unwanted parts for points you can use to buy parts you want, but the porportion of scrap you get for a part is so low that you could grind for 6 hours always getting 2 of the best quality crates per match (this asumes you win and be the highest on the scoreboard) and you'd still not have enough for a blue quaility part (part rarity at lowest to highest is white, green, blue, purple, orange). Premium time allows you to skip the slower-than-a-snail pace of grinding for those extra parts in the crate that they dangle in front of you but are locked behind a paywall, as well as a more recent 3x recycle points which should be the base rate for recycling for those who don't want to spend any money, as well as 12 more paint colors that people could easily do without.Will likely leave you annoyed, frustrated, and dissapointed as it did me.",0
7576,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is basically Clash Royale with hero avatars, so a bit like Clash Royale meets HearthStone I guess. It plays a lot like Clash Royale but there are two bridges in the game you need to control, the longer you have them under your control the more exp you get which enables your hero to do get some skills. IMHO it's a vast improvement over the Clash Royale game because each hero you has a a distinct playstyle, this leads to a lot of varieities in decks you play against. One thing I don't like though is deck slots are locked till lvl 20, it's a pain to make decks or search for the card you want.I find the business model to be both fair and a bit unsatisfying. On one hand you get a pack a day, there is dust to craft cards you need and there is a ""free rotation"" on heroes. On the other hand though, the ""pack"" is really just one card so buying power stones isn't that satisfying, once you have a decent collection good luck getting new cards as you will just get duplicates which will get dusted. I bought 10 power stones and got dust and a crappy card.  Another thing is you still need to buy heroes separately, of course you can also grind for it using freemium currency but this game isn't exactly free to play so why are we paying more stuff for heroes? If this is the business model then just make it F2P outright, they have a promotion giving out free steam keys for people following their newsletter which essentially makes this game free, but for the average Steam player who has no idea there's such a thing he'll be paying for the game, and then pay for it again in micro transactions. At least right now though paying $13 gives you the Premium upgrade for free so you're getting something for your money and players who didn't get a free steam key don't feel like they got ripped off. Even with these gripes though the game is still pretty good and addicting, I find it to be much improved version of Clash Royale both in mechanics and business model. I highly recommend it.  ",1

Fairy-tale like colors accompanied with beautiful graphics in TOS will have you reminiscing about precious moments all throughout the game.

The ingame economy is broken, prevents youform playing if close to top tier vehicles without pumping in boatloads of realworld currency, and in addition to this, instead of atttempting to alleviate the gameplay or in game economy issues, the developers simply continue to nerf rewards, and add higher and higher tier vehicles which aren't even feasible to obtain or maintain in game.",0
3821,Brawlhalla,2018.0,"Summary:Brawlhalla is a simplified version of the Smash and Brawl Mario games. It is clean and smooth, responsive and easy to learn. The graphics are enjoyable as is the music. To top it off there are all kinds of multiplyer modes, including local co-op and it also supports many controllers.The negatives unfortunately aren't many but they are quite obvious. Much like other games of its kind it suffers from spam abusers and characters that are easy to spam. The developer's  focus has turned over to making extra money with the use of more and more aesthetic items, all of which can ONLY be bought with real money.All of the legends are locked but there are weekly free rotations. My main complaint is that players, once having unlocked all the legends, have no use for gold. A gold to mammoth coin conversion method would be handy to allow others to be rewarded for their play time.Final Thoughts:The simplified version of Smash that is easy to learn, suffering from some smaller balancing issues in matchmaking but still extremely entertaining, especially if played locally with friends.  FINAL SCORE: 8/10   Positives: Achievements, cards, extensive controller and MP support, easy to learn.   Negatives: Attack spam, needs more balance in matchmaking, too much focus towards premium/aesthetic items.

The artwork isn't great, it's actually bad, but for some reason it works and creates some unique charm for the game's image.  My problem is the cash grab nature of it when it comes to little purchases.  I understand they're making money, but the Diamond option for gifts is a ripoff.  The inefficient and messy restart system would be fixed if you can buy things in increments of 5,000 and 50,000 also.  Having to redo that purchasing 1,000 and 10,000 options is a pain when you're in the end game.  More outfits would be nice, also having the date and purchase button on the girls requirements instead of having to go to DATE and GIFT every damn time would help.  I'd give the game a 3.5/5 or 4/5.

The fanboys who will support whatever the developers do, and explain to you that that Freejam is doing everyone a service by allowing this game to be free.  You have the new players who probably think this could be a great game, if they worked on a few things (things that have existed in the past, and have since been done away with).  You then have the old players, the ones who put a lot of effort to get that last bit of RP to get the next piece of hardware, to hopefully lift you to the next tier.  Those players have seen this game turn into a phone app that says ""FREE"" next to it and then right underneath ""in game purchases optional""...but we all know that you need to purchase those if you don't want to be miserable for a while.

587,Magic Duels,2016.0,"You have probably just looked at how many hours hours I've played this and thought I must like this. I do in a way but there are just way too many problems with the game for it to be fun. I'm talking about actual bugs and design flaws - things that should not be in the game (I'm not going to judge deck or card balancing here).A Couple of terrible bugs - Trying too find an actual multiplayer match can be ridiculous. About 30-60% of all searches for a standard 1v1 game won't work and about 50-80% of all searches for a standard 2v2 won't work. There are a couple of different reasons for this but all of them are utter crap.- Particularly in 2v2 matches, the game will break and the match wont continue until a specific person has left the game is just beyond a joke and happens about 40% of the matches. Rare in 1v1's though.- Certain spells also have a chance of breaking the game causing the match the stop until someon quits is again bloody terrible.A couple of terrible design choices - Text chat has been removed destroying any communication in 2v2 which is absolutely moronic.- Removing game lobbies in 2v2, I'll explain this one. Unfortunately you do come across some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who join a game just to quit which compiled with struggling to get a game can really♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. When you try to find another game you can end up with the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ again. The lobbies in the old games showed who was going to be in the game so if you knew there was an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you could find another lobby. Plus these lobbies worked so much better for actually getting a successful game.- If you minimize the game or it gets minimized by another program and its your turn, the game decides to skip your turn entirely which heavily punishes you.- The time limit per turn is outrageous long. Some people deliberately waste as much turn as possible hoping their opponent will quit from boredom and give them an easy AI match victory.

16796,Team Fortress 2,2018.0,"Gaben has singlehandedly sucked my social life and my bank savings out of me with this one ""free to play"" game. Well played, Valve. But, still, there are plenty of good things to say about this game. It's certainly one of the few with the more pleasant communities that I've run into, and for every script kiddie or unpleasant player, there are plenty more humourous and amusing ones just here to have some lighthearted fun. With an audience that seems to be made of older teens up to early twenties, with some younger kids sprinkled in, the community still manages to be friendly and open. Mostly, anyway. You'll meet an aimbot or a more hostile player in a few here and there, but what community doesn't have those. TF2 is considerably nicer than some gaming communities I've been around.The competitive scene is lacking, and while the TF2 team is making an effort to put some emphasis on comp, pubs remain the larger attraction for many new and old players alike, leaving TF2 players who are interested in playing competitively, unfortunately, high and dry. These players have to go to third-party sources for opportunities to play in competitive modes such as 6s and Highlander. Valve desperately needs to provide a competitive mode similar to these two forms of competitive TF2, or perhaps a non-competitive option that allows players to practise 6s / Highlander. Their comp mode is much improved now compared to what it was a few months ago, but it certainly is still lacking.Though there are only nine playable classes, there is always something new to touch upon or some skill to learn and master. TF2 provides an abundance of weapons that are obtainable through crafting, trading, drops, or purchases. The large range of weapons definitely give classes more options, more opportunity to vary playstyle, and endless creativity when it comes to how they take on a game or counter an enemy team.Some classes can definitely be fixed/improved upon, such as the pyro (many of whom seem to know only one playstyle: the W+M1 'meta'), and there can definitely be changes made. However, I understand the delay in doing so, as balancing/changing a single class can have profound impact on the rest of the classes and the game.Overall, a very fine product that remains fun to play and always leaves room for learning despite only having nine classes, and one that has a relatively welcoming and fun community. It's not a surprise to see that TF2 is a game that's thriving after more than 10 years. I have made a great amount of (online) friends in this game, both by interacting with the communities within dedicated to Tf2 YouTubers as well as in-game. Glad to see a product so community-focused (even if at times I wish it were a little less so). Fine job on this one, Gaben, and godspeed to the TF2 team.( Also note: there are hats. lots of hats. You'll never see as many hats in your life as you'll see in this game. )",1
629,Path of Exile,2014.0,"One of the better F2P entries on the market for certain.

Levelling and screwing yourself and worthless currencies in particular. I can genuinely say that I like character progression better than Diablo II. It's still doesn't capture the holy crap moments of Diablo II loot or have the presenation of the gold standard either, but it sure as hell does both of those better than the cancer that is Diablo 3.Only thing I hate is server lag.

Although I'm not sure if I should give the top spot to this one or Legacy of the Duelist since this one has some changes to the rules such as smaller field, smaller deck etc.My only issue with the game is that the AI is complete retard, it's unable to properly use my deck and ends up losing some auto duels.

If you're a Magic the gathering fan it's pretty decent and the only real thing that i has in common with Hearthstone is the style.as with all card games Luck can and will skrew you over as well as bless you and make you feel epic. to complain about RNG in a card game is just silly. I have not had much troubel at all with making decent decks on this game with  gauntlet mode and forge making it easy to get a decent collection as well as  the ability to frag all the extras and create what you want. Granted some cards are way over priced but think of it this way, some people payed £100+ for a zapdos or £1000+ for a black lotus in magic terms. All in All decent card game with a  mana system similar to magic, but slower paced than Hearthstone.And it's free to play so you can get a feel for the game before you decide to commit so give it a try!",1

Except here you pay to win absolutely nothing. Previously there were alternate methods to pay for certain items in-game but with the latest set of patches we see that premium currency is needed to purchase these items.Since one of these items is the Unlimited Advanced Licenses which are used to fish for any fish on a lake, it makes this game very difficuly for the casual gamer to play as playing for a short period of time usual means you are getting now where. In order to play this game in its current state you would need to either spend real money to help you along or spend lots of hours in a single sitting to grind through from lake to lake.

13818,EverQuest II,2014.0,"The Everquest Franchise has always been a great experience. I have played Since 2004 - Everquest I and II. Since Everquest II came out around the same time another big MMO name came out, they seemed alot like the same game. But the changes and the hard work that the developers have put into it, listening to players; allowed the game to evolve. The game has become easier to use while still a challenge to play. I am very excited that they decided to go Free-to-Play, it allow us to play it and taste the game before deciding to dedicate ourselves. The key elements that I love about this game is the storyline and the combat system. The monsters and bosses in the game ""learn"" as you fight it , making it harder and harder as time passes. The story and the system make it so realistic and enjoyable no matter what you are doing. You dont only have to fight monsters to enjoy the game either, theres an entire other side to the gameplay. Which involves crafting; creating items for housing and for characters to use. You can specialize in armour making or even just making wood crafted furniture for housing. It has a simular leveling system and somewhat of a mini game to each attempt to making this product. I enjoy the creativity, I enjoy the flexibility, and I enjoy the friendly community.With the constant acceptance of feedback to the GM's and the staff, both players and the employees at SOE create a wonderful game that anyone can enjoy.",1

Two years ago I got bored of the micromanagement right quick and called it a day, this time around I found the game (now) has quests and quests I have been doing for almost the entirety of my 19 hours.The game's been designed to make you buy power-ups, but as things such as VAC bans are hardly an issue here, I Cheat Engined myself 99999 Nuka Cola Quantums and skipped any and all countdowns. Some of them would have been a real pain - 11 days just to craft 1 theme to get 1/8 of an achievement, for example. Did manage to get all but 3 achievements - 100 objectives, 50 raider attacks and 20 legendary dwellers are too much of a grind even for someone as pedantic as myself. Human lifespans do have a limit to them.This'll hopefully be the only Fallout game I'll ever give a negative review to. Although Shelter does get you hooked very well from the start, quests are mildy funny and it feels good to score phat loot, without hacking you wouldn't even have that.

If teamwork is your thing then join up with an established fleet or take the plunge yourself and create a fleet just for your friends. Fleet management is, I will warn you, a time consuming and stressful at times vocation but it can and does bring its' own rewards.So many dimenions to the economies of the various currencies out there to mention here but a shrewd investor can actually make Zen (PWE's in-game currency) from the dilithium market.Overall, I'd recommend this to my friends as you have the option of playing for free and if you like it, you can always spend a bit of pocket money on improvements or even a new ship.7.5/10",1

11342,Brawlhalla,,"is the story of how a simple 2D fighting game gave me anger issues.for my opinion this game sucks legit its grind after grind the comunity sucks and there are a lot of spamers they dont buff or nerf the wepons which suck  cuz facking axe and scythe are the most op weapons in this game they are 2 rule if you want to enjoy this pice of trash 1: dont play ranked if you want to destroy your controler or your monitor or if you want play 2v2 ranked 2: play with your frends dont play solo cuz sucks every time  My conclusion:         The game works pretty well in theory. It's quite similar to Super Smash Bros, which is a game that many people enjoy, myself included. You pick a character with a simple weaponset consisting of two weapons. The weapons include spears, katars, scythes, swords, gauntlets, blasters, axes, bows, hammers, and cannons and now a orb  My personal main, Orion, utilizes rocket lance and spear.After choosing your character, you'll enter the game. You'll notice that the characters have both light attacks and heavy attacks, or signature attacks, which you can use in chain combos. Each character has original signature moves; no two legends are the same.With the basics out of the way, you'll probably find yourself having some fun in a simple matchmaking or bot game. You'll play a few rounds, get a grip on what you're doing, and log off for a while, having enjoyed some harmless fun on an innocent looking game.The game has a great art style and a great soundtrack, I'll give it that. You can tell the developers made an attempt to make a game that could be enjoyed by everybody.Well, try not to let these first impressions impact you to hard. Past the surface, this game and its community are on a whole new level of toxicity, chaos, and general despair. In fact, I'd even compare Brawlhalla to a drug. On the surface and on light occasions, Brawlhalla is general, good fun, especially with friends. However, if you start liking it a little too much, or if you want to get better, the trouble begins. Now, where to start?First of all, the game can be incredibly frustrating. Gaming rage is inevitable in pretty much every game. It might even be healthy to let off a little steam. This game, however? Brawlhalla has given me some of the worst gaming rage I've ever had.Hey, difficult games are perfectly acceptable. There are countless examples of games where deaths feel fair and deserved and make you want to persevere through them to the end, making the reward even more satisfying. It's intoxicating in the best way. It makes you feel great!In Brawlhalla, however, almost every death is completely unfair. Even now, I still play matches where I'm left shaking my head in disbelief at some of the brutality that comes rolling my way. It makes me want to play more, not because I feel good about what I'm doing but because I feel like I need to prove myself or get better to try and get past whatever stupidly unjust attack I'm hit with to no avail. It's a brutal endless cycle that keeps pulling you back for more.The spamming problem in Brawlhalla is a major one, but it really is a simple fix. Add cooldown times to attacks after using them three times or so in a row to encourage players to experiment with more attacks and combos. This would not only fix the spam problem, it would build skill and better tactics for the next battle.As a usually pretty sensible guy, I never thought that one game would have such a negative impact on my life. I beg of you, if you want to keep your family, friends, free time, and anything else dear to you, avoid this game at all costs.thats all i have to say i dont want to play this game anymore  only small exception with frends",0
7949,Realm Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewNot sure what all the negative reviews are for. Its alpha there will always be a bit of bugs a server lag sometimes.  The devs on the other hand actually listen to the comuinity and there are updates and patches frequently. It's a super fun and good battle royale.,1
2254,Crush Crush,2018.0,"Pretty impressive for an idle game. Try it if you like anime ""kawaii"" type.This one has very nice graphics (I'm still impressed by the effort put in this game), a side story for each character (wow) and even multiple endings. There is only one music but for now, I'm still enjoying it at full volume (because I'm crazy for animes).This game is free to play w/ some pay to win bonuses (in fact, you buy diamonds which give you some multiplier on stats earnings) but hey, nobody forces you to spend 2000$ just to get the ending faster ;)oh and yes, there Is a catgirl, an idol, a nerd girl, an athlete girl, and your secret crush is here too, you know, the crazy one that kills every other girls that may love you in secret ^^",1
7757,Magic Duels,2017.0,"The game's tutorial portion is fundamentally broken and randomly uncompletable due to required cards not appearing in hand or already in play.  The game then endlessly loops asking you to use those cards, but as they are not there the game enters an infinite loop of tutorial resets and pop ups clamoring for you to use resources that aren't there.Wizards does it once again with horrible progamming and no resources spent on digital media",0
9792,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,I started playing the game and all was fine until I got into the higher games where Germany had way better weaponry and almost always won.

13593,Star Trek Online,2017.0,"Well, this is coming from a player who doesn't spend money, but trying to avoid being toxic about it.The game itself is fun. If you're a fan of Star Trek, you'll enjoy it. The stories are meh imo, but the just flying around a Galaxy or an NX Class is pure joy.Getting to the end game is easy enough, but once there, I have found the game to have stalled. Unless you spend your entire life mining dilithium to transfer it to Zen, you can only get better stuff by spending money.The subscription for monthly Zen, or just buying Zen as and when you need it. The end game free ships, are to be honest... naff. You either need to spend ridiculous amounts of in-game money to buy keys from the Player Run Exchange/Auction House, or spend Zen to buy them. And even then, what you get from the boxes is run by Random Number Jesus, so it could all be naff as well.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Basically put, the game is fun until end game for free players.

3043,Realm Grinder,2018.0,"Definitely one of the best clicker games I've ever played. I bought all the things to support the developers that give me a few benefits, but it feels like my progression might be sped up a bit too much with these bonusses. I know I can turn them off but then it feels like a waste of money. When you ascend and you have all those bonusses you can skip a huge amount of time every single time, if you just start out you also get as much progress in no time as someone who didn't start out with those bonusses. I had played this for about 5 days without bonusses, my friend bought the bonusses and was instantly on my progress so I also bought them.All in all, a very good in-depth clicker game that I'd recommend to anyone, just wish the bonusses from buying the extra things weren't so insane.",1

18209,SMITE®,2017.0,"Please note, my hours played are highly unnaccurate. I've clocked roughly 300+ hours, prior to having a Steam account.As someone whose first MOBA was League of Legends, Smite was really a breath of fresh air for me. The grapics are simply amazing, and it feels like a large step up for a MOBA game compared to others out there. The one thing that blew me away is just how many events and how many skins you can buy with Favor, the currency you get just from playing games. Skins bought with Favor are basically just recolors, but it's still more than most free to play games would give you.Smite brings the action right into your face, as you play from an over-the-shoulder camera angle; which actually makes you have to aim your auto attacks, something mostly unheard of in a MOBA before Smite came around. There's so many modes to choose from, and if you pick up the God Pack (preferrably on sale) you get every God/ess they release, forever. It feels like Smite just brings so much more to the table than any MOBA before it.One thing that always goes overlooked when people talk about Smite is the lore. The people in charge of creating and releasing new gods really do their research into mythology to make the gods abilities fit their myth or lore. As a fan of mythology when I was in high school, I find myself reading the lore and actually looking up some of the gods I've never heard of from other cultures just to read up on them, interested in how they all fit together. I've not yet found a god in Smite whose ability set didn't fit their theme, in my honest opinion.My only issues with Smite as it is now, is it's not very new player friendly. What I mean by this, is if you came from another MOBA and/or that is your main genre of gaming, you will be entirely lost on how to work your way around Smite, as I was to start out. The balance is also a major issue that I've noticed compared to most other MOBAs. It doesn't seem as bad until you get further in and the characters you hated going against turn up in every game, fed beyond your wildest dreams and stomping all over your team. If you are a fan of the MOBA genre, or even just want to give it a shot and want something new in your library, I highly reccommend giving Smite a try.",1

My suggestion to the developers, expand outside the U.S. Some of the best lure fishing in the world is chasing that 1m Barra in the top end of Australia. So I and many other Aussies would love to see that addition to the game and through research I am sure you guys could show the world of Fishing Planet the challenge of hooking one of the most powerful and exciting to catch fresh/saltwater river fish in the world, along with other great species in the topend.

That's not necessarily a bad thing, but there is an unsteady balance between performance, features and quality. When the team focuses on one, the others suffer.

The game is easy to get into, and provides video tutorials in the game to anyone who is new to the game and even has a youtube channel that has the tutorial videos there as well if you are looking for further guidance.

Though one could argue, as often done, you don't have to buy any of the stuff, that would just ignore dynamics of psychology, which are so offensively exploited here.High tier crafting is rendered nearly useless without buying the booster, as crafting one single high tier weapon takes between 1-2 weeks. With booster, producing 4-5 of those weapons instantly can cost about 90€... Seriously Bethesda Software?

(If I'm not using my broken controller) Time to get back up to that Diamond rank again and slap everyone around. I am Limitless, a Call of Duty 4 Legend. (known as another alias from  Youtube)I am the most complete 1v1er in the world, my style is impeccable, my victory is glorious, and my defeats are none. None of you can take me, my skills are far beyond yours, and I understand why, It's due to the simple fact that I am more Godly than you. But if your want some consultation on your Brawlhalla playing I am able to give you some pro tips if you really want. Send me a message and you may get some.I enjoy this game, I do however wish the people in ""top tier"" competitve were better. Most cannot even take me down one stock. Pathetic scrubs acting like they are on my Limitless level.  ",1

3826,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewHaving played PUBG and Fortnite, I prefer Realm Royale as the map feels very diverse with different climates in each pocket of the map, and not the mention the unique class to choose from which differentiate itself from it's competitors. It is still rough around the edges and the animation seems clunky but given that it is in alpha, there is still room to improve. It's not a rip off of any battleroyale and it has a potential to be a damn good game. I recommend trying it with an open mind and not be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like the Fortnite fanboys.",1
1964,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,Playing a few ranked games every night gives me enough coins to do a few arenas on the weekends.At this point getting cards I want is a slow grind but I'm having fun with my deck so it's fine.Game is very addictive at first but after around 150 hours I'm starting to get bored and looking for something else.I wouldn't spend money on packs but I would happily buy more story campaigns.,1
19695,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis iis one of the best CCG I have played so far. It has a lot of features from Magic the Gathering such as the way units can block and playing ""lands"" but they modified it so that the lands part is not so much RNG how it is in Magic, in this game you get to play units much more often and more action packed games. The turns are fast, but still with a lot of depth, not so much waiting like in Magic. It has the beautiful artwork kind of an edgy comic book style, nice voice work on cards and the story modes. It reminds me of battlechasers the art and sounds. The game is very generous to players, you can earn tons of cards and packjs each day you play all for free. They even just had a nice Twitch prime event where they gave players 33 packs free + avatars and card backs and so on. The story mode is very fun and another way to earn more free cards.When you complete quests the game gives you some free theme decks each week, you can use the cards you get in there to mix with your collection to form new decks as well, so thats another way toget more cards free and fast,There are draft modes, casual play, ranked play, even AI draft style matches and ways to earn cards in Arena style games vs AI and real players.The board looks nice, cards have nice animations and sounds to them, I like how they mixed most of the depth of Magic but made it feel very fast paced and exciting like Hearthstone, but they removed most of the RNG that both of those games have.I rank this game up at the top with Elder Scrolls: Legends and Magic the Gathering Arena, those are my top 3 online card games right now. Eternal is a great and fun game! ",1

121,Magic Duels,2015.0,"Let me first say: I love MTG, been playing it for years, and I have been anticipating Magic: Duels since I heard about it. I love this game, it is exactly what I wanted (easy to play magic with coop, so I can play Magic with my friends all over the world).However, the game is currently unplayable, so I can't recommend it. Some people can't start it at all (I can do that at least), others get no starting cards, others get no boosters, other get no coins. You are constantly disconnected because Wizards of the Cost is too greedy to pay for proper servers, so you lose progress all the time.I have tried completing the second campaign (Jace) for 2 hours and now I have given up. I always get disconnected and my progress is reset.As soon as this game actually becomes playable I will gladly recommend it.",0
3398,Realm of the Mad God,2014.0,"First of all, I'd like to say that while there are certainly those who are more qualified than me to judge this game, I feel I have played it enough (and over a long enough time span) to write an accurate review. And yes, I only got it on steam so I could review it, meaning that I've played for quite a bit longer than 0.2 hours using the browser version.Next, I give this a *very* tentative recommendation, since this game is great for some and hell for others.Now, for the actual review:",1
12092,Trove,2017.0,"!The hours displayed here are NOT representing my total game time! You can play the game through the ""Glyph""-Launcher also, which i prefer.

The community was nice, everyone was helpful, and the ones in end-game were helpful in every way. Then, the game released on steam -.- cancer community, just like League of Legends. Salty kids everywhere, the end-gamers insult everyone. But thats not the worst...The game got a free add-on (expansion) named ""Mantle of Power"", in which gems were introduced. This killed the game for me, and every of my friends. Since then, the game is brainless grinding for resources. Only the early game is fun, the leveling and the gearing to be exact. But when you enter the mid game, to improve your gear and wealth, your brain turns off and it is everyday, every session the same, over and over and over again. Grinding resources is the keyword of the game, and it becomes more and more pay-to-win.With tears in my eyes, i do NOT recommend this game. I used to love this game, i was addicted. But TrionWorlds killed the game, making it less and less fun to play.",0
2275,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"I had over three thousand hours in this game by the time i 100% completed the achievements.Some were boring, some were tedious but generally they were all enjoyed, the game has regular events and weekly free golden chests to help with gear and other resources.As far as clicker games goes this is an incredible one, easily remarkable as the first of it's kind.No actual money is needed, as long as your willing to invest the time, effort and patience, you can play this game without investing a cent. There are a few DLC content for this game that adds character specific gear which is a nice add on to invest in, but it isn't a must.",1

14403,Creativerse,2017.0,"Really good game, especially for a Minecraft-style voxel exploration game. I've seen complaints here about the game not loading & a lack of public servers (there are over 2000 I can join, and I've had no problems), but they seem to be either unfounded or due to very low-end PCs trying to run a game they can't handle.As for the claims that a bunch of blueprints are behind a paywall: first of all, there's only a handful that seem to be ""Premium"" or ""Pro"" or what-have-you. Second, building blueprints aren't necessary for building certain structures; they just give you what amounts to an easy-mode building guide to replicate prefab structures. The other Pro benefits are just nice bonuses, nothing necessary or even super-useful. Oh, a flashlight? But I can make torches by the dozen for almost no resources. Oh, longer sprint times? So what, it's an exploration game, not an action MMO. And it's not like Minecraft isn't guilty of putting all the good texture packs & skins behind a paywall (esp. on consoles).All in all, I think this does what Minecraft did, but better. I'd like to see more from this dev team, honestly.",1
14945,Champions Online,2011.0,"Honestly, this game isn't the best MMO in the universe, but creating your own superhero and using your travel powers can be the most fun you've had in a game period.The combat is meh, kinda like a console superhero brawler and feels good with a controller.It's a standard Superhero MMO ala City of Heroes, or DC Universe Online, but with a more comic book look to it.Basically, download it, play the Free Silveraccount type and add @Maniq to your friend's list.",1
16674,World of Warships,2018.0,"I haven't played this game longer than 2 days, so take that as you will. But i can summarize this entire travesty in few words.Torpedos should never have been implemented into this game. It's a horrible mechanic, and has no place in a game where you're moving that slow. Shooting your guns makes no sense, if you shoot once and try to correct your shot, your next volley goes where it wants pretty much. I think the concept it pretty cool, and am looking forward to a competent developer picking up on the idea where these guys just failed out massively. Also, after playing 20 matches I have encountered 8 people.

13876,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016.0,"In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strike’s wretched ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to become the man I am today. And, now, I’m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.",1

20206,Dota 2,2015.0,"Learning Dota 2 is like learning the entire history of the world, every civilization, every war, every political situation, every nit-picky historical detail. Except valve keeps changing the history every patch.It took me 1000 hours to actually say ""Huh, I think I now completely understand how to play the game properly"". And even that was achieved by being a dota nerd, watching guides, theorycrafting 24/7 while eating or sitting on the toilet or traveling or trying to sleep. It becomes an obsession, a challenge to learn the entire game. Only to unlearn and relearn everything again every major patch. It's more mind straining than getting an academic education or even trying to get a PHD. I never thought of the game as worth the effort and time investment.So why keep playing if one thinks it just isn't worth the time investment? At first it was the damn human curiosity, experimenting every detail and enjoying the results. But after that phase 2 main reasons remained: too much free time and not having another game to play. Mainly it was the latter reason. Me and my friends would find some games, play them until we were bored, find singleplayer games, finish them, aand then there was nothing to do. So no other game? Back to dota. I hated this vicious circle. I tried to quit atleast 15 times, deleted the game several times while I had a really poor download speed, tried quitting by removing my monitor from the house, changed the pw of my only account in windows to something really long and gave it away to somebody so I couldn't open the computer, deleted steam entirely several times and tried much, much more things to quit. I couldn't. Stuck in the loop, I kept trying to improve my gameplay by watching high level players play and explain the game. Until one day...I came across ChiLongQua's youtube channel...The first video I saw, he was non-stop feeding the enemy team, while complaining about the issues in the game such as:-im 5k yet i always get matched with 4k ♥♥♥♥♥tains that don't know how to play the game, you have to forcefully tell them on mic what to do-last game my teammate gave up and fed for a puny argument and if my game gets ruined, im gonna ruin someone elses gameMy first thought was: ""Huh, an annoying tryhard rager kid that flames everyone on voice chat just because he lost some games"". But the more I watched, the more I understood his psychology and his reasoning behind his actions. It is a long story but in the end I eventually decided to feed like him just to understand his mentality even more. And boy, was that a turning point. I analyzed everyones reactions as i went down mid and gave my life as a gift to the enemy team. First, I realized how♥♥♥♥♥♥ and inefficient the enemy team was at killing me. I ran around under their tower and they still struggled to kill me. This alone made me realize the enemy team is way worse than I am at the game. My teammates reacted to the situation like expected. But in the sentences they produced I was able to understand they are simply stupid. The results were amazing. I was enlightened.After this feeding session, I played my next game normally(while still thinking in my mind that I am the best player in the game) and I stomped that game. I stomped the next game after that. This was weird. Because I had been stuck at that my mmr for years. But the change of my mindset gained me 600 mmr in less than 10 days. Realizing that I will almost always have to carry my team if I want to win, I will always have inferior players to me in my team and the enemy team, I was able to slowly stop playing dota. I realized the game as a whole was a pile of mess, that cant be fixed, if you dont fix the players. So my hatred for dota grew day by day, and one day I deleted the game for the last time. It has been over 2 years since I last played dota. The hatred kindling, kindled by CLQ grew so big that I was able to finally quit. CLQ had saved me.Later I played dota again with my friends once several months when new big patches came. But I wasnt getting addicted anymore. I was able to enjoy the game with my friends again.This game is a vacuum that will suck your life and soul in. There is no ending to this game. Valve will keep trying to manipulate players to come back to the game by updating, even if the game is balanced. They will ruin the balance to keep the game interesting and fresh. Because its business. More players playing = More skins sold, more crates opened. Even the ♥♥♥♥♥iest jobs of today does at least pays you back, so you can buy food and some other things you like, keep your life going. But dota doesn't. Don't live dota. Most of the players aren't even playing dota to have fun anymore. They play it to shout and get shouted at, after a day of stressful work. Dota 2 is a psychiatric hospital that doesn't fix people, it only makes them worse.I certainly don't regret any of my playtime I have on this game. But I am glad I dont have any more hours than what I had currently spent on it. If it wasn't for CLQ and the enlightenment he provided me, I would have sunk about 5k hours into this game by now. (Sadly, he is still playing dota forcing himself to be positive and not rage. He defies his own past, defies his own opinions. Just because youtube is an income for him. His position is just sad.)With that many hours, you can master any craft, study anything to become one of the best at the subject. But if you sink 5k hours into dota, you will still be an above average player. If you don't go pro, you get nothing in return. Stop lying to yourself. You aren't having fun playing this game. It became a stressful work a long time ago. Think about it.If you don't agree with anything I said, just go ruin a game, purposefully feed and analyze the other players reactions. One game won't hurt. Then think about all of the above, again.If you are already a high skilled but non pro player with your teenage years buried into this game, think about other games you couldve spent a fraction of time on and became one of the top players, earning all that e-sports money you can't get playing dota 2. Since you never actually played any other game while not thinking about dota in the back of your head, you are unable to comprehend that there are other fun games out there, that don't require wasting 10 years of your 70 year life to learn.03.05.2017Ahmet Faruk Albayrak",0
230,Magic Duels,2015.0,"Boy does this game make me mad!  They gave it to me for free, set me up with a solidly usable core set of cards, prepared a fun and interesting campaign for me to follow introducing me to the storylines, practically threw in game currency at me as they taught me the game, and streamlined the in game purchasing so that I can never get a wasted card - seriously, every single freaking card is one I need for my collection.  It's terrible!I'm tired of looking at the beautiful artwork.  Sick of having loads of fun with my Whirlybird Thopters.  Annoyed with thinking about all the cool combos.

328,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"Despite being my favorite game of the past year, I still have to agree that Planetside 2 has one of the most difficult learning curves to pass in a game. For new players interested in trying out this game, I recommend expecting to die more than kill initially. However, the sheer scale of combat makes for an amazing display. I remember when I first started playing,  I joined a battle spanning several territories-- Huge lines of tanks were exchanging fire as aircraft swooped through the chaos. It was an amazing introduction to the game, but not an uncommon one. Ps2 contains some of the most expansive, strategic, and intense fights I've experienced in the FPS genre. Progression through upgrades feels rewarding, and there is no ""Pay to win"" option for those who choose to spend money. I personally recommend trying to help your team before you start doing hilariously insane things (Like my outfit does). Overall, there are hundreds of ways to play the game, depending on what class, loadout, and customization you choose, which evolves over time as you earn more items. There will be times where you get tired of playing, then immediately get back into the game because you've discovered a new and effective way to fight. Conclusively, I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants an FPS that they can enjoy for a very long time. TL;DR-- Planetside 2 is an MMOFPS that both captures the massive scale of battle and gives options to the micro scale of each individual player.",1
9093,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEdit 6/4/18: After performing all of the INI fixes I could find as well as the OpenGL fix on reddit the game has been running near flawlessly. With 80ish fps in the fields, 120+ in dungeons and a solid 55-60 fps in the main city. If you're having trouble running the game I'd recommend looking into the OpenGL fix for sure. Someone else also found a way to actually disable the profanity filter and its been working for me, now I can see people say heck again.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Bless is in a weird spot right now, and I wont judge anyone for wanting to wait a bit before deciding to jump in.I didn't play on launch day so I can't speak on how that was. However the game has run well enough for me and been very enjoyable so far. Combat feels great playing as a mage with the tab-targerting(I personally prefer it over action combat). There was supposed to be action combat for all classes but it was pulled for all but the berserker prior to launch in order to be refined and eventually re-added.As for all the complaints about missing content in endgame, they've already said it will be re-added very soon, approximately 2 weeks max. Until then there is still plenty to do, you don't need to full speed rush to 45.There have been consistent hotfixes and patches over the last few days to fix and make up for the bugs and balance issues currently happening and given a bit of time to smooth everything out the game will be even better than it already is. The only complaint I can really consider as valid is about the translation, it is absolutely horrid sometimes, almost like it was thrown into google translate. Luckily there are already 3rd party skill builder websites that have proper translations so I can figure out what my spells even do. Quest translations haven't been too bad however and I actually rather like alot of the voice acting.All in all I personally love the game so far and plan to keep playing for a long while. If it doesn't look good to you right now I'd say just keep an eye on it or throw it on Follow and wait until they sort things out a bit more. There is a balance patch planned to drop any day now which should alleviate alot of the issues people are having with low damage.",1

It will show the wheels spinning then have them move really fast for a couple of seconds. While this is USUALLY not a problem, I have died once because of this.

There's absolutely no pay to win features(unless for some reason you consider cosmetics pay to win), the maps are small but balanced(To those complaining about snipers, the maps are clearly split into different areas with different lanes, there's a cross-map lane for snipers, and usually along the left and right hand sides of the maps there is a CQC or rifle-range area for those who dont enjoy sniping).

2252,Trove,2018.0,"I really loved this game before, but that was before.The game is about completing your collection of cosmetics and being stronger and stronger,i liked the collection stuff because i'm that kind of person that like collecting stuff and cosmetics but everythingis so grindy and hard to get or completly based on luck.For being stronger you have to complete dungeon over and over and over forever that you get so much annoyed by them you just bomb your way to the boss, for to collecting gems and equipment to recycle,its easy early game but end game is a nightmare , the chance of upgrading your gem is so low you feel like you are forced to waste all your ressources to buy the most powerfull upgrader.There is also some update i didn liked at all , 2 of them :It really annoyed me when i realized that the chaos chest and a lot of other loot box will be no more tradable and all of itscontent will be no more tradable, it maked the collection stuff so much more harder and so ridiculously expensive !And then the adventure club update, i loved the content and was happy about that but i was not really happy about being demoted from my own club that i created and spend a lot of ressources and time in it, this is just unfair and broken.The lags, for some reason the game is laggy as hell , you get rollback , when you fly you get smashed to the ground because of rollback , you finally climb dungeon ? no no rollback do it again, load a world and disconnected from server, do a shadow tower boss but then you have a huge lag and when you are back half the team is dead ? just trove things.. Over time it become really iritating and this issue is in the game for so long i'm surprised the devs still did nothing about this. ",0
18786,Digimon Masters Online,2018.0,"I recommend this game on the basis that it is a good way to spend your time, and is a lot of fun for Digimon fans and younger audiences. After playing this on Steam, as well as the Aeria release for several months beforehand, I want to bring up what I view to be the game's strong points and negatives.Positives:- A wide range of obtainable Digimon, with varying Digivolutions and Side Digivolutions.- New Digimon are added fairly frequently, and you can always develop your team upwards.- Even now, there is still a fairly large community, lots of players are active and supportive of one another.- It's free to play.- Early game, you get rewarded a lot. You also gain rewards based on playtime, and your own achievements.Unfortunately, no game is without it's flaws:- It has not aged well. Despite being a classic at this point, the game has added very little progression past the original max level, and once you've hit the limit, there is no incentive to keep going.- PvP is not a thing, at least not in my experience. I was aware that it was on the way, but nothing came of it.- Due to the RNG of hatching and evolving via items, the game can become pay to win if you do not wis to grind for hours and hours.- Hatching any egg is a game of luck. You can spend lots of resources, dozens of eggs, and fail every time. You may get lucky, but it is very discouraging if you're after one Digimon in particular.Ultimately, this game is a fun way to spend your time, I do recommend it, but I do not think you should get too engrossed in it. I wish I could say there was a lot more to this game, but it's a product of it's time, even though it has been brought to the modern day by a lovely team.If you want to pick up a free to play MMO for a few hours, have fun on this one.If you're after a long-term game with lots of incentive, then it's in your court.Have fun if you want to join in!",1
2244,Paladins®,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewYup.  It's a poor mans' Overwatch.  But, that doesn't make it a bad game in the least.  Considering this is a f2p title, you really don't have anything to lose.The map that I played several times feels familiar in that it has a lane and flanks, a single capture point, and a payload (which I feel  should be extended.)  The matches feel much shorter than Overwatch, and there's no actual mobile skills for our agile characters.  No double-tap dodging, not wall climing, no verticality, none of that.  But there are movement-based skills embedded into most of the heroes.Theres a card sytem which HR calls ""Loadouts.""  After each player level you obtain a chest to unlock that will pretty much RNG the hell out of you -- which isn't a bad thing.  There seems to be a lot of cards, so building numerous loadouts with these cards could be benefitiual if you know what you're doing.  Right now I'm maining Fernando to help people learn how to play this game. (Yeah, there seems to be a lot people still new to the sub-genre of this game.)   And because he's a sexy mother ♥♥♥♥er. ;DAnywho, pick it up, it's free and if you want to team up, just message review and i'll add you. ",1
1879,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2018.0,"Konami's Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links is a competitive trading card game which awakes nostalgic feelings due to the series Yu-Gi-Oh! (1996-2004).Sound/Music:On the one hand the background music is pleasant and awakes feelings of nostalgia. On the other hand the ingame voices of the duellists really annoyed me, especially in situations when i end my turn even faster than the voice sequences ended. Thus, I usually prefer to play the game muted.→ 5/10Gameplay/Fun Factor:There are two different worlds in the game: The classic Yu-Gi-Oh! world and the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX world. I prefer to play on the original world but this depends on the personal taste. There are a bunch of different ways to play this game: You can either play against the AI-duelists, do challenges (depends on the updates) or you play against other players in the PvP section. Usually the duels are short and intense but sometimes you get matched with laggy people or AFK people which makes it hard to enjoy the duel due to long waiting times.→ 8/10Graphics:The graphics are nothing special at all but it fulfills the expectations of a simple card game. I really dislike that this game is edgewise and not longitudinal. But this category should not be a major reason for/against the buying decision.→ 5/10Long term Motivation:The game gets a lot of updates which come with certain challenges and new booster packs in order to keep the game diversified. Although the principle of the game stays the same, it gets tweaked via new cards and challenges which motivate to play the game more often than a usual card game. On top of that you can level certain duelists to unlock specific cards and you have a overall player level which increases with the fulfillment of certain tasks.→ 8/10Price-Performance Ratio:Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links is free to play. It really offers a decent amount of content, updates and variety for a free game - even more than other games that cost way more. There is still the possibility to buy decks, cards, card cases etc. with real money but this is not necessary at all.→ 9/10Overall: 35/50 ",1

1626,Trove,2016.0,"Here's the short of it.""Was"" (in some aspects still is) a Good game with a lot of ways to kill time with friends, but now its all about the $$$. Oh, you are new? ♥♥♥♥ you, pay me!Here's the long.The reason I cannot reccomend it anymore (mostly for new players) is because of changes made to the game around the time of this review. Classes in game can no longer be unocked with cubits (currency earned from grinding). Instead classes must be purchased with money, which is going to affect new players the most since they will be stuck playing out as a single class, which for their sake I hope they chose wisely. Mabey if they like the game enough they will buy a new class, but it will be hard to enjoy a game where you are stuck using something you regret choosing, no? If you have enough in game resources, you can buy a class coin (unlocks one character) for a hefty fee from another player. New players wont be able to afford these class coins. Another thing that has changed is the acquisition of dragons. The update was supposed ""to make getting a dragon easier"", lies. It is now more difficult to get a dragon as they must be crafted with a hefty(er) amount of resources, unless you would like to pay money to make things feasible.  I understand that running a F2P online game takes money, what i cannot stand is when corporate does not come out with the truth behind decisions. If a game cannot sustain itself with its current marketing structure, just say so and explain that this is the reason new financial implementations are being added. Do NOT decorate the playerbase with colorful rhetoric and dry PR statements saying ""this is to make things better for YOU!"" Doing this makes people look like greedy parasites with only financial gain in mind *cough* starts with T and ends in N *cough*, and I for one do not wish to give my money to such people. Pay to support good people and the good work they do? Yes, absolutely. Line their pockets with the scalps of ♥♥♥♥♥hillas? NO!If you want to try this game, look up each class and determine which one you will enjoy playing as the most. Just be aware that this game just got VERY grindy in two main aspects, and is likely to get even more so in the future. Avarem be praised! (he does the in game announcements, hence the ""skygod"" title others and I have given him) screw the devsEDIT: Well... look what the game has come to. I warned the playerbase the moneygrabbing would get worse, and they said ""no, this is just to support the game"" and ""this game takes money to run"". Well I'm fairly certain those players have since said ♥♥♥♥ it and abandoned the game as I did so long ago.",0

15053,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI've played all the usuals, HS multi time lgend etc. Currently play TES:L and learning Prismata.I’ve only played around 60 hrs, so I acknowledge the problems I am expereinceing with the game are from a perspective of someone that desn't know it very well but...  Kick off with an obvious one. Not keen on the mana system, leading to frustrating games with flood and screw. Yes one mana per turn systems have their own problems. I often don't seem to have many options of cards to play. Resulting from lack of good card draw and having to draw mana from deck? Games often end up with players top decking against each other. First to draw something good wins. Blocking vs direct attacking system is heralded as more complex therefore better. I agree it is slightly more complex as you have to think about all the possible permutations of your opponent blocking but I don’t think its better. Whilst it does make for slightly more technical thinking, they mostly aren’t interesting decisions to make and are usually just either correct or incorrect plays. It also leads to a lot of tedious stalemate boards. Again wait for a good top deck. The argument that the greater mechanical complexity of the game (e.g Instants, blocking, mana management etc... ) when compared to for example HS is a good thing I think is wrong. Again it doesn’t seem to lead to any more interesting decision making just for a more technical game.  Some strategies seem stupidly easy to play. I crafted a Tavrod Midrange deck that  required very minimal decision making and very easy to win with after only a few days experience. ",0

Boldly going where no man has gone before.Fractured Space is one of the most polished and well developed failures in steams recent history, if any game deserved to do well it was this one, and yet far from doing well, the game has struggled to break 350 peak CCU in recent months, matchmaking times are often measured in the 10s of minutes vs minutes and its only peaked over 1k once in near 2 years, for a game with 500k+ early access registered users, there surely must be a huge problem with the game for it to have such a low ccu? or maybe not.The most realistic multi user fleet simulation ever.Amazing graphics, decent mechanics, great sound design, a very fair free to play system, a wide choice of ships, on paper there is no reason for Fractured space to have failed the way it did.Developers deserve a medal.With such low CCU, and having lost over 99.9332% its user base (basing on the 500k users figure, its probably even higher % by now) you would not blame the developers for leaving this game to rot, and yet the developers continue to push out new content, even launching a new co op campaign mode, allowing PVE to go beyond simple player vs bot missions.So if its so good, why is it failing?The game was the opening volley of a possible genre, a Space Moba that focused on capital ships sounded amazing in principle and was executed about as well as possible the problem is.. it seems the genre wasn't one gamers wanted or embraced.Worth a play?There is plenty of free solo content to keep you busy, but the overall long term survival of the game i would question, its never managed to attract a large user base and with upcoming titles in the genre it cold lose some of what it has already.https://bluntlyhonest.review/2018/09/18/fractured-space-a-polished-product-without-market-appeal/ ",1

Also the pay wall doesn't personally bother me too much because I grew up playing card games.What you need to know: 1. Twenty card decks rule the game, and these decks are usually loaded with the best traps and spells money can buy. So if you play this game pick a card box with the best spell and trap cards in it and keep using your free gems on those boxes until you have two or three copies of said cards. Pro tip, reset set the box after you pull the cards you're going after.2. You'll see the top meta decks so many times that you'll beg to see some originality... Lol, you'll never escape this, even in unranked.3. Farm Mai for Amazonian cards because Amazonian decks can be mostly built from card drops. Amazonian decks are pretty powerful, even in ranked.  You can also get solid plant/water cards from the card trader. (Google this for more info)4. The game has alot of connection issues which can end a match prematurelyIMAO:1. Honestly play this game at your own risk because it's designed to make you spend cash.2. Deck sizes should be increased to 30 minimum3. Card boxes need fewer trash monsters / better spells and traps cards to balance out the F2P Ultra Rare card discrepancy.4. I could list more serious problems caused by Konami or just gameplay in general, but these are the things I hate the most about the game.In closing, IF I SEE ONE MORE FULLY LOADED BLUE EYES DECK I'M GOING TO VOMIT!",0
491,Champions Online,2015.0,"     Never did like the graphics, being forced to turn off the default big-blocky-outline effect that never should have been there in the first place.   That generally works for your character, but then you look a bit out of place when the rest of the world and half the other characters still have the outline.  Actually, your character never really looks like it actually fits in the world graphically.     The costume designer is alright, though the asymmetrical options are lacking greatly and the overall options aren't really spectacular.  The real problem is there's no significant choices in the non-costume parts of the character.   You look remarkable similar to a large portion of the rest of the world no matter what you do.  And the cro-magnon stances that seems to be default for the male characters are as bad as the 'let me shove my chest at you' poses for the females.     The plotlines seem pulled right out of a bad Hero System chapter of a Dragon Magazine wanna-be that never sold.  And despite what the box and some dev comments say, you never really feel like you've changed anything.  The world is the same, the missions are the same, and everyone does the same things.Really the only bright spot in the game are the freeform characters.  That's not too bad and a few other games could learn something from it.  But an entire game really can't live on that alone.I so desperately miss City of Heroes.

10501,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2014.0,"Although I wouldn't call this a ""Game"" it is quite an interesting experience. I enjoyed learning about the different weapons and pieces of authentic equipment throughout my experience playing this. The one major fault I have with this game is that it needs to have an easier way to get XP, maybe through the gun range? I'm not sure how that could be resolved but it is quite boring 'grinding' XP for new guns. ",1

16816,H1Z1,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewDO NOT BUY THIS TRASH !!! I I pre ordered this game pre alpha and enjoyed every second of it on Z1, but Z2 is a nightmare and how much of a joke this game has become and the company that develops it is sad. I have been Royalty every season and loved this game, but after pre season 3 the game went to complete trash, for months Daybreak did nothing to fix the game until PUBG came out in March and then Daybreak started doing pointless updates such as adding colors for vehicles, and an absurd amount of POIS in efforts of keeping their player base, but when that started to fail they decided let's make a combat update and take key elemets that make PUBG a great game such as tracers and a compass but scuf them and no one will know. This past combat update has ruined the game in my opinion to the point of no return, there is absolutley no skill gap on this game at all anymore, someone can buy the game a day ago and full spray 2 tap or just flat out full spray you to death even if you are a veteran player, how does this create an equal level playing field on a game that prides itself on not having attachments and wanting to create a skill gap. The developers on this game are so bad at their job, that they can't even fix a shotgun so they add an MP7 to further the already non existant skill gap, and to top it off they thought it would be an amazing idea to add bloom to the game which has killed off other games. The numbers on steam charts and Twitch don't lie H1Z1 is dying and it's because the developers don't know what they are doing. I can't play the current state of the game for more then an hour anymore, which is sad because before  I used to spend a whole day playing it having fun. And the tactic they are using right now to hype up their invitational at twitchcon by paying streamers like joshog and summit1g to stream their game and have them participate in the event is only a temporary solution to a dying player count, because once the event is over with, people won't want to play this trash anymore. These updates they do to supposedly fix the game only make the game much worse.",0
17243,War Thunder,2015.0,"This game is f*cking insane! I love it so much! I've played it for about 5 years (I played 4 before I found it on steam) and I never got around to stop playing this magnificent game. I have had some slight breaks from it though, due to *Cough* Rage *Cough* but I am addicted again. The community? Well some people are nice, and some people just go: ""Wow, f*cking idiot noob piece of sh*t."" instantly. I am not that kind of person, I try to be nice to people, if they are my teammates that is.I currently have 4 german jets, and about 5 tier 5 tanks aswell, The Me 262 A-1, Me 262 C-1, Me 163 and the Horten 229. Tanks: Tiger II 10.5, Maus, Leopard, Gepard and Raketenjagdpanzer. It is so fun when you can just pick whatever you wanna play, but I always have goals for what I want. Currently my focus is CL-13a Sabre mk.5 because, come on... it's the CL! I played it on my friends account once and loved it. Anyway, enough talking about me... let's talk about the developers. As far as I have seen, they are pretty nice. But I have been told some of them are complete dickwads... cancelling other's accounts. Taking their GE and even taking their vehicles! (The last one I doubt) but they are pretty help some if you need help. Their home screen system (Where you pick vehicles and what not) is... well okay, but it could be worked on. Some things, I absolutely HATE about this game is the hit or not to hit system... thing. Like, bullets who fly 4 meters high can still hit me, and sometimes I just get one shot without ANYTHING getting damaged. (No, the pilot was not killed either). And the Lost control thing, absolutely DISPICE IT, like why do you have it in there?! It will just f*ck your day up even more! I think, that is all I have? Yeah I guess so. See ya! And stay safe lol.",1

But for the last year or so they just started to add op vehicles that can only be purchased to the game. And we are talking 50 dollars per vehicle, something you would pay for an entire AAA game (few months after release). And those vehicles are not even optional - only light tank for germany is $50, only good heavy for americans is $50, only good tank destroyer is $50 for russian, best medium for british is... you guessed it - $50.

16102,Dungeon Defenders II,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewTo start my review, I'd like to say that I'm very disappointed by the devs of the game.

I still recommend it.Why?It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for a game I paid ... I don't even know, I only know I paid too much. But for free to play, it's a good game to sink a few hours in.

18067,Realm of the Mad God,2013.0,"It's my favourite. The graphics are very well done; so well done, my eyes were baptized upon seeing the amazing quality this game has provided. Along with graphics, the definite story-line was amazing. The final boss was so well designed using his amazing powers such as shooting rectangular and circular pixels. The difference between the bosses and normal monsters is that bosses shoot more and do more damage. I thought this was a well-thought and creative attribute, providing originality. The characters produced were also fantastic, not being the most generic characters at all. Characters such as ""mage"" and ""knight"" were concepts I wish other games would use. The characters were 100% unique and never before seen in any other game. Overall a very creative game.  5/5 stars for sure, without a doubt.",1

17156,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,"Great idea, but the devs became greedy AF, and now you need to grind hours on end for the next weapon, which might not even be a firearm. You can use the insane amounts of ingame currency to buy a new weapon, but you earn so little that its not worth your time. On top of that, you also have to spend the ingame currency on upkeep on your weapons... Im not kidding, you have to buy bullets, and the weapons wear out, so you have to spend more ingame money on repairring them. And to get upgrades for a weapon, you of course have to grind that single weapon for hours, and spend even more insane amounts of ingame money to get them...Or you could just buy some gold for real world money, and skip the grind, but your gonna need loadz!... Oh and the graphics havent been updated since release",0
229,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"Heres my 2 cents as an avid online card player. Shadowverse IS a well made game. First off it is a card game. Nothing I hate more than downloading a game with cards in it to find out it is a phone app energy game lol. It comes complete with a campaign, ranked, and tournament game modes. The card graphics are unique and well made while the card animations are quite smooth. In the beginning playing this game feels like a real treat and you absolutely will not regret it. There are tons of free packs and gems thrown at you like candy. You'll be getting legendaries and epics all over the place and making tons of variations to decks.The only real issue I have and still have with this game is the extremely confined class cards. I would say about 90% of the cards are restricted to a single class and 10% are not. To top it off nearly all the classes have superior cards of the same type compared to basic cards which leaves you no reason to use them anyways except for one legendary neutral card that replenishes your evolve orbs. Not to mention it is super easy to get a bunch of rare cards in one or two classes then a legendary in a class that you have no cards for lol. I think something to fix this issue would be to allow someone to pick a pack for a certain class.Overall I really enjoyed my time in this game and had some epic comebacks and losses. Also some arena decks that were so synergized I didn't lose once. It gave a lot of good feels and do not regret but I do feel the lack of customization really effects the overall replayability.",1

5290,War Thunder,2016.0,"Do you dream of flying a B-17 dropping bombs and coming back all beaten up.  Or go down in a blaze of glory while your gunners are firing at the enemy as your engines are shutting off while on fire and your doing your best to keep it in the air.. Or maybe fly in a huge formation over enemy territoy.Well keep moving this is not the game for you..  Bombers last about two seconds in the air. My last match literally 2 mins ago i lost 5 bombers, from 3 b-17s to a b-24 and a b-29 to a single bullet, and not pilot death no, as in my entire plane exploded,  5 different times, same match. And thats what this game is, over and over. No real team work at all. Bombers literally spawn and dive to go as fast as they can to the targets to bomb before they go 1 shot out the sky and hopefully just hopefully they can turn around after they drop the bombs.  So ya to get points you have to hell dive as a b-17.  Tier system is  horrible, the grind is so bad, bombers are useless.  Im serious a b-29 with no bombs in bay,  exploded one shot from a spitfire.

Hell, I'd say that the only, ONLY DLC that's worth it was the Exodus Pack for $10 and the coins are not worth your money what-so-ever. Pretty time consuming, but nonetheless... REALLY ENJOYABLE.

And it'll do many things to you. At one moment you'll be raging and wanting to bash someone's head in with your keyboard/joystick. There's a lot of annoying stuff in the game, mostly spammers and  point farmers , but once you get good at the game, you can easily counter that and sweep the floor with 'em.Now, how do I describe this game? I can go for the low-hanging fruit and say it's a Smash clone, but if so, it's a Smash clone done right. See, every character, instead of having their own specific set of moves that noone else has, have two weapons. Now, while the specials of these weapons will differ from character to character, the basic attacks for say, one character with Sword will be the same for the other character using Sword. For the incredibly low and generous price of 'free', I'd say getting the game is worth it. Just be advised, it'll take several hours to learn how to play, so I suggest you spend some time in training and vs Bots after the Tutorial, maybe with a combo guide open, to learn. That is, unless if you're gonna play casually.Pros:+Interesting soundtrack+Easy to learn, hard to master+Overall fun, reallyCons:-Can sometimes be infuriating-Takes a lot of hours to really enter the game if you want to be competitive/win",1

10212,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Product received for freeEarly Access Reviewin short: MTG clone // excessive pay-to-winI understand that most card games will have some similarity with Magic The Gathering. However Dire Wolf really went one step further with Eternal and simply cloned Magic...right down to the lands which were a problem in Magic already and we now see smarter mechanisms in pretty much every card game. But I guess that makes it easier if you do not have to bother with rules and balancing and such. The card pool seems awfully large and I feel like I would need to put in way too much money to build a reasonable deck: 50 cards per deck allowing 4 copies each seems excessive and costly.,0

13740,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"Planetside 2 is, and with no doubt, THE FPS/MMO out there, the game is simply massive. The game is free but if you want to buy stuff like camo, guns and stuff, you have to get Station Cash, which is the in-game money. In my case I never bought anything with station cash, just a 2 bucks small pack off Steam. The other way you can get upgrades and weapons is by getting certs, which you gain by killing enemy players, repairing vehicles and units, though, many of these weapons are kind of expensive in terms of certs and it takes a while to get some of them, but in time you start getting certs and using them to upgrade your vehicles and your character's shields and/or qualities. If you are new to FPS's the gameplay could be a little bit confusing and hard to understand, but once you get the idea and the whole concept you enter into a new level of battle, forget about Call of Duty or Battlefield, those games look tiny and insignificant next to the massive idea behind PS2, TOTAL WAR is unleashed every day between the 3 factions introduced in the game (GO NC, GO!). It is not necessary to buy weapons in my honest opinion, but the base weapons you start with (especially for the NC) are wild and sometimes hard to manage due to the recoil, but in time you get used to it. Battles develop in a massive scale, you get to see dozens of tanks battling each other, aircrafts dogfighting in the limitless sky, hundreds of soldiers shooting and firing everywhere, total chaos that is rewarded with a fun time, even more if you are part of an outfit, which makes things much more fun and interesting. Once you get to understand the game, you feel the need to keep on playing, even to the extent that you forget about your whole library and can't quit the excellent approach of this game, if you are looking for a whole new experience in multiplayer gaming, Planetside 2 is for you.

That's not to say that they couldn't have more card designs to make it better (more draw or cards that help fix mana in some way) but designers have to take into account positives and negatives when balancing, not just dwell on salient negative outcomes which are often self inflicted e.g. through bad deck building.",1

So then I played the game mode 'team death match"" because it is the only game mode I know how to play. Once the game had finished I did not earn any money. Confused, I looked up why and apparently you actually have to buy items to make your robot unlike before where you could literally play this game for free. Robocraft is no longer a free to play game.

From there, after being harassed with spending money, trying to find a server to play on via the gameplay modes and navigating the server screens (plus, you can only sort by ping which is depicted as bars like a cellular signal) is quite cumbersome.  They somehow managed to ♥♥♥♥ up the basic essentials to like every multiplayer game ever made.Loading screen bar doesn't actually show loading progress at all.  After joining, my ping on the lowest server (US) was 600-2500ms.. I couldn't find a server that dropped below 600ms and most times they were hanging in the ~1500 range and woud even spike to 4500.  You can't see this number before actually joining the server, by the way.It only gets worse from here.  The high ping is obvious, even when picking up items/shooting zombies; essentially rendering the game uplayable.  I kept going, though, in hopes of making something of the experience.  You'll never be able to miss an item as they glow a bright blue.  Mechanics of even the basic things like walking/strafing/springing/etc. are pretty bad and shooting guns feels like I'm playing with children's toys; extremely easy to aim and do a lot of damage, but god forbid you actually are able to hit another player that isn't stationary with the delay.  People are spamming the global chat, players shoot on sight no matter what, and overall the community seems like a cest pool of inbred ♥♥♥♥tards.The inventory system and overall mechanics of items is pretty horrid--an obvious ripoff that they somehow managed to make worse.

19014,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewCuisine Royale is a parody game of most battle royale games out there. Despite being a parody, it's actually one of the best battle royale games. I've played Fortnite, PUBG, and some other battle royale games. Despite that fact, I still think this is the best battle royale game out there.The art style is great. As a history lover, me and my friends all like the WWII setting and it's good to see what the game they're working on will become. The way the animations work is hilarious and goofy, purposefully, is great and it fits the design perfectly. The idea of protecting yourself with kitchen gear as a man in his underpants is comedic, and definately helps the game show it's a joke game.Even though it's a parody, it's better than PUBG. The gameplay is great, and is way faster than PUBG, and is less boring. A cuisine royale match takes 1/4 of the time that a PUBG match does, and you'll have more fun playing it. The game is fast-paced and gets your blood pumping, and it's realistic style helps it's surreal atmosphere. The gunplay is pretty solid except for some rather questionable times, and it remains to be fun even after multiple matches.In total, the game is great and I think it plays really well. With the ability to play squads and duos, it's really good to play with my friends and we love this quirky game. I would recommend getting it before it becomes paid.",1
6248,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"I have only a few hours on this game and while I went with an open mind, my first impresion are pretty bad. the UI is akward and counterintuitive and the game doesnt bother to explain to much about it's mechanics. You could argue that you learn them over time, but it's hella frustrating doing even that. However in spite of the crap UI the first few matches were okay, everyone seemed to have the same gear (semi-automatic rifles) untill someone came around the corner with smg and just mow you down, but hey I could get over it since it was just the lowly smg, but than all of a sudden i was put in the same match with players with superior gear with 1% chance of winning a duel, cause i was still stuck with the base rifle...progresion is steep and it's meant to be so to incentivise you to buy gold and get that nice gear.I wanted to like this game, but the UI, unbalanced matchmaking ruined it for me.",0

17360,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you are an angler, or virtual fishing enthusiast, this game might be for you. I say ""might"", because unless you are willing to spend $50 or more, it is a serious grind to earn money and upgrade your gear. I have 3.1 hours, and am only level 3. I probably will play more at some future date, but I am unwilling to spend either a hundred hours or dollars to make this game enjoyable.  One of the early real money bottlenecks is traveling and day fees. If you don't catch catfish and white crappie all the time, you will run out of in-game currency fast.  This game, like all free to play, is geared toward real money. I wouldn't have a problem with most free to play games, if items and bundles weren't so expensive. I have spent over $100 on TheHunter, Mechwarrior online, etc. Unless free to plays downgrade their premium prices, I won't spend much time in them.",1
47,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"It saddens me to not recommend this game, after years of waiting and finally playing BOTH the iCBT and Early Access, I think I have to say goodbye to this game.Pros:+ Great soundtrack. Boss battle with electronic/house/EDM vibes are the best.+ Great artstyle.+ Complex and unique class system. Theorectically you can build your character in many ways while progressing through ranks. Want stronger Swordman skill? No problem just choose Swordman again when you can class change. The choice is yours.Cons:- Linear map progression and quest chain. The only time you need to break the chain is when the quest chain dump you at a map with monsters waaay higher than your level at that time, in which the game technically force you to warp to another city to start ""another"" linear quest chain.- No map variety. They are either forest, cave, or dark underground temple.- Tons of grind, though for some this is not the problem.- Free to Play but Pay to Win. Token system sucks. Will have to wait and see how Cash shop will improve in the future.- Exploration was supposed to add some extra element from all the maps and quests repetition, but became tedious along the way due to stamina management and repetitive maps and monsters.- Stamina system.

9619,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"Team Fortress 2 used to be a good game in like older times, well I stopped playing the game nearly 3 years ago but now it seems to gotten much worse since I stopped. Here's what I don't like about the game:THE COMMUNITYThis has been a problem since the beginning, and making it free to play (even when I started as a free to play) made it even worse. They expect you to be 100% perfect at the game and if you don't stay up to par with your team, they will blame most things on you, even when you didn't seem to do anything. They also have a chance to make fun of you if you have no hats or taunts or anything, which according to them, if you have no items in the game, you're obviously a bad player, and if you have a backpack filled with rare items and is worth like thousands of dollars, you're automatically considered a pro at the game.There's the players who are way too good at the game, which ruin the fun by taking all of the kills and making the opposing team scared and, of course, making them rage. Most of the time, someone calls a vote to scramble the teams, or they go into spectate mode and wait 3 hours just so they can join the other team. I honestly think that people are easily enraged by this simple game.MICROTRANSACTIONSAnother way of slaying people's wallets and life savings. This has become a common thing in many games today, which does include PAYDAY 2 and Killing Floor 2, but I honestly think this game has the most microtransactions. They seem to be almost like getting addicted to a drug, your brain just wants more and more of it, and if you don't get enough, you suffer withdrawl and end up wasting your money on something virtual instead of something better you could buy in real life. I think there's even, for example, a skin for a knife for the Spy costs more than a knife in real life.GAMEPLAYI guess the gameplay is what keeps many players involved. The gameplay is not actually that bad, but it's mostly ruined simply by the community. The game is also considered very unbalanced from what I have heard with the new update. Competitive and Casual appear to be very unbalanced, commonly from the opposing team class-stacking (having multiple players play as the same class as one another). The XP system is also dumb, because the only way to get XP from games is by winning, nothing but winning. You get a kill? Nope, no XP for you.The gameplay may apply with what I said earlier in the community, with how some players are so skilled at the game that they take the fun out of it and make the enemy team scatter. There's no separate servers that are for skilled players only, and there aren't too many assets that indicate a skilled player.2/10 - Definitely do not recommend playing this game for thousands of hours ... or even hundreds.",0

17585,Realm Royale,,"Access ReviewTL;DR of why the reviews are ""Mixed"". The game was great when it peaked at 130,000+ players but then the devs made some controversial changes to the game. The game devs have since then corrected all of the unsavory changes they made and the game is exactly where everyone wanted it to be. Unfortunately, Fortnite had too much of a grip on the industry and no one really came back to try it again. Luckily, the player base has been slowly rebuilding and as of right now I can comfortably say this is the best Battle Royal on the market. If you are a returning player, I'll have a bit at the end of this review that breaks down the big positives and negatives of the game since you probably last played if you want to read that. Now that the TL;DR is over, let me voice some opinions on this game. Realm Royal is one of many Battle Royal games that are currently oh so hot on the gaming scene right now, but what stands Realm Royal apart from the others is a unique set of mechanics that alters the gameplay in fundamental ways to make it more strategic, less punishing and more competitive. CLASSESThe first and largest change from the standard Battle Royal is a class system. Every time you begin a game you have to pick one of 4 classes; the Warrior, Mage, Assassin and Hunter. Each of these classes has advantages with specific weapons and abilities that fundamentally alters the flow and playstyle of the match. This brings us to the second major variation of the game.ABILITIESThroughout the game you have two ability slots, one for an action ability and one for a movement ability. Everyone can use every ability in the game, though some classes can utilizes specific abilities better than others. For example, the Warrior does area of effect damage when landing when he uses heroic leap, or he has a reduced cool down when using any shout ability. Abilities - like weapons - can be found in 4 different rarities, each being better the more rare they are. RUNESThese are pretty straight forward. They are a item you can get that give you a passive ability for the rest of that game. Some are better than others but I would not call any of them ""broken"".FORGINGScattered around the map are forges that allow you to craft weapons, abilities, health and armor potions, runes and even team resurrections. Shards are obtained through either killing other players, or deconstructing other forms of loot you find on the map such as weapons, runes and abilities. This is another major variation that Realm Royal has from other games in the genre. Forges make for more objective oriented gameplay that require a tactical approach to either avoid or combat other teams or players. OTHER ADVANTAGESRealm Royal has a few other ways that it stands out from the crowd that I wanted to cover in this review. First, the variations in weapon types are incredible. You can find mage staffs that fire spells out of them, a magical hammer that shoots blasts out of it, throwing axes that are hard to land but hit for massive damage, rifles that are good at a distance. There are so many weapon types that it took me awhile to notice the interesting lack of the assault rifle weapon type. This lack of a machine gun type of weapon is actually by design and leads into my next point very well, which is bullet damage. In many other Battle Royal games, if you are spotted first, this puts you at a massive disadvantage because simply put, one shot can take MOST of your health. This game, no weapon takes MOST of your health in one hit which means you have more time to react to an encounter, and thusly out maneuver them in a combat situation to still come out on top. This is a massive advantage to this game in my opinion. This makes the game less focused on movement and map awareness and more focused on actual combat skill and how you react to an encounter, all while keeping movement and map awareness still important. I cannot stress enough how much me and my friends have been enjoying this game. We are diamond now working our way toward challenger and it has been a blast every step of the way. I don't usually go all out on a review like this but this game deserves it. It's devs have made some missteps in the past but they are obviously fully committed to correcting those mistakes and trying to deliver the best Battle Royal experience possible. AND IT'S FREE!  For Returning PlayersHere are the major bullet points. Bug fixes everywhere. Assault Rifles have been removed. Classes have been re-added. The Engineer has been removed as well as his abilities (the turret mainly). Armor is no longer a thing, only armor potions that you can find/craft and apply. You start with health equal to full armor before it was removed. Runes are a new passive ability item you can find and they are sick. Basically every major criticism this game has faced has been addressed and fixed in the game. If you enjoyed the game before, I cannot recommend you enough to grab some friends and jump back into it. This is the best the game has ever been.",1
18809,Digimon Masters Online,2016.0,"Fingers crossed for this being an early beta or alpha. The game has potential but it crashes alot and lacks interesting starting quests.

1100,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,"This game is basically trying to tell us that jumpscares are really creepy, no matter if they are a creepy face like the one in the ""scary maze game"", or a ♥♥♥♥ing cute pumpkin.

But the bigger your vault gets, the more fun it will be. Because that's when you can start doing more quests, training your dwellers special stats, and crafting weapons, armor, and themes. Overall a great and addicting game, would recommend.PS: I've seen some people complain about the microtransactions, but the truth is, you don't even need to spend a single penny to have a good vault.

6725,Paladins®,2017.0,Early Access ReviewIt's not the greatest shooter but it's still kinda cool. The card system makes it not a complete overwatch ripoff atleast.Also it runs pretty well on a windows 8 laptop I've been abusing the hell out of for the past 2 years.,1

3958,H1Z1,2017.0,"Early Access Reviewthey threw updates worth almost over 100gb but if you'd ask me, this game has not changed since its release. The map has changed once, the weapons/cars and gameplay in general is the same since the release. they never thought about adding one gun to the game. There's only a shotgun, an ak and an m4. The same bugs still occur after years. eg: parachute bug, car stil moves when you get out... Performance ? just don't think about running the game for more than 2 hours on max settings, ram usage will drastically increase and you'll have severe issues and drops. System spec: i5 7600 , gtx 1060, 8gb ram. I start off with around 130fps in the woods, around 100 in the city the first 30 minutes of gameplay. After around 2 hours i get like 90 everywhere but in the city i start getting drops to 60 which is not acceptable. I know it's still playable but the memory leaks are a huge problem in this game.

It’s not the bogged down tab-target “sit-and-watch, hit 1 2 3” that the genre grew up with, nor has the pendulum swung all the way toward the oft touted “action-MMORPG”Every class in Neverwinter can solo quite easily, and because the combat is probably the game’s greatest strength, there’s no shortage of fun for those electing solitary confinement.",1

1991,GUNS UP!,2017.0,"Early Access Review  Like most ""Free To Play"" games there will always be those many ways to easily progress using real money, and for those who can't or don't want to invest in such usually don't get much further than the tutorial..  However ""GUNS UP!"" isn't really pushing you towards the idea that you will have to buy items in order to ""Win"",players can enjoy this game without feeling obligated or forced to buy something.. although it is an option to do so, and however much your willing to spend can easily fly you above any players say that aren't going to buy anything at all but Whatever it is that another player does buy, the player not willing to spend any money at all can also acheive the goal of obtaining the same items.   My experience from playing this game was quite enjoyable, it can even be addicting at times. The online is good as well, allowing you to choose players to fight that are usually around the same level or progression in the game as you, so it kinda contridicts any critics saying it's a ""Pay To Win"" game, since you never will be entering battles or defending against anyone that may have bought items using real money and could be considered too hard.  If your looking for a ""Free To Play"" game that is not ""Pay To Win"" then here you go, its also a great time killer and if you just like having something else to do this game can keep you pretty busy with upgrading and just fighting in general. Although it is not a game for players to just come and go, I would say you'd have to keep up with it all the time and play it often to actually enjoy the full game experience however that isn't a bad thing, it's just how the game works to fit into it's genre.

2884,PlanetSide 2,2015.0,"I have almost 500 hours on this game and honestly I still can´t review it properly. I started playing this game on my laptop, and i got super excited with the idea of fighting different wars with vehicles, airplanes or just by foot. The time has arrived and I wanted a better experience, better graphics so I built a desktop just for the game, the graphics were amazing!!!(everything max.) and I played a bunch of time.Learning how this game works is important, I mean you can play it but your inical K/D is going to be extremelly negative. (I´m not going to describe every single piece of the game because (1)I´m lazy (1/2)It would take a lot of time). The worst thing about this game is the aiming system, not because its bad but because its really hard to control, even with 450 hours i was still an average player, actually when i started playing CS:GO (after playing PlanetSide 2) this game was super easy(CS:GO). If you have played other FPS games this one isnt as easy as it may look, bullet physics and huge maps make it almost imposible for new players.To sum up i think this game is a master piece (for a free game), the best game i played so far and its not a P2W GAME!!!

8425,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"After leveling a character to 150, I feel this game is in noway ready for release. It is littered with bugs, server lag, poor design choices and a lack of variety and content past level 120ish. Pros:+fantastic art style - this looks very unique compared to it's modern counterparts while at the same time feels familiar to anyone who has played ragnarok online+satisfying combat - combat feels fast and fluid and attacks have a very satisfying feel upon useCons:-Server lag/crashes - when you are limited to 2 dungeon runs a day and the exp gained contributes a signficiant part to leveling, it is stupid for the instance to crash and boot you out while consuming a daily dungeon run-Horrible way to counter gold sellers/botters - gold sellers and botters are still rampant and doing a google search on gold sellers, it is easy to tell that all the measures this game has in place hasn't worked. On the down side, it is terrible for actual players. Non paying customers can only trade playing customers but any traded item becomes character bound (destroys resale value once you outlevel your gear). You can't trade money to anyone - friends included. Auction House allows only 1 item listing for non playing customers with a 30%  AH fee (10 items with 10% ah fee for paying customers). You can only collect money from the AH after 48 hours.-Lack of content for progression past level 120 - unless you count endlessly grinding mobs for 0.01% or doing daily dungeons as content. Current max level is 250 - 300 so there is a huge grind wall ahead...-Dungeons become painfully long and repetative - dungeon design is uninspiring and only worth doing a handful of times but most people go for full clears not because it is fun but because of the vital exp needed to continue the grind-Though it is free to play the game is severely gimped without a subscription. It becomes impossible to meaningful play the AH without a subscription. For a grinder, efficiently killing things is ontop of the list of priorities but withouyt a sub your character moves significantly slower and receive 30% less exp -Character stats cannot be reset as of today and while skill points can be reset - job changes are fixed. As such, without a lot of prior research, there is a very likely chance that you will need to reroll if you want to play something that is decent.Overall, this game starts off being alot of fun with it's nice visuals and initially fun combat but soon devolves into your standard korean grinder. Implementation feels old and dated (something from 10 years back) and the sad thing is...there was no reason to make it as bad as this. Taking queues from say GW2 - you don't have to gimp non premium player progression - just add alot of visually pleasing cosmetic goods in the cash shop. IMC didn't need to lock down trade features so heavily to try and prevent botters. Worst of all, there was no reason to make the grind wall as severe as it is...The game has an enormous set of classes and builds to try, I would much rather play a variety of different classes and builds rather then grind a single character ad infinitum.",0

1815,Neverwinter,2014.0,"Model (F2P): The biggest downside to the game is its Zen system which, I suppose is the only way for a free MMO to make money, as one would expect from a F2P model. Unlike in games like Path of Exile, the items purchased with Zen can definitely be game altering and offer advantages that free players would not have access to at a much earlier level. However, there is a way to convert in game currency (Astral Diamonds) into Zen at a conversion rate that changes depending on the market. Neverwinter sometimes pushes the player to use special currencies in order to open lockboxes containing level-appropriate equipment, but is otherwise not too intrusive. Unfortunately, the in-game currency of Zen-to-Dollar ratio uses an extremely expensive conversion when compared to other F2P games such as Rift. While most decent item sets cost somewhere between 1500-3000 zen, approximately 500 zen = $5, depending on how many Zen are purchased at once.Gameplay: Some of the most innovative and fun combat you'll find in the current MMO scene. The classes are very well fleshed-out, but definitely not balanced as of yet. Most classes require re-positioning, timing, and anticipation when reacting to enemies or even allies' actions. It's definitely not a click and spam blindly game. Unique mechanics are introduced depending on the class. A Guardian Fighter can hold up a shield to block attacks, while a Rogue can quickly close distance with a teleporting strike. Every class feels truly unique and full of flavor. The combat system is mostly based on a D&D-type of ruleset with skilltrees in the form of feats and eventual specialization. While questing is very linear and everything else is pretty much what you would expect in a standard MMO, the profession system is more of a que-and-wait.  Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who's awaiting WildStar and its combat system and wants something similar to satisfy their hunger for ARPG-type combat. Additionally, creative minds can use this game to create scenario-type quests and dungeons through a feature I personally have not used much called the Foundry.Multiplayer: Standard faire for the current MMO market. PVP scenarios of varying types pitting 5v5, co-op challenges that can quickly be completed with friends or random players, and dungeons. Lots of variety for all types of players and a guild system. Most players use the in-game chat to find groups or members. No innovation, but definitely satisfying for those who don't like soloing.7.5/10",1
12102,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewPros:+addictive and fun at first+nice graphics+fast duelsCons:-so much much much much more frustrating than fun-unbalanced AF and devs don't giva a f*** about that-P2W in it's worst -bugged and glitchy-rigged matchmakingAfter playing this piece of crap for a while I'm absolutely certain that this is one of the worst ""games"" I've ever played. Notwithstanding that it's Early access. Actually, being EA makes it's even worse: you absolutely must not charge money for something as glitchy, buggy and unbalanced as this. It's should be called ""Abuse masters"" because that is all this game is about: you buy a master with easily abusable perks, buy a lot of tokens to get good cards to build abusive deck and there you go. Unless you make mistakes or get matched against another abuser you win everything. That pretty much explains why devs don't bother about balance: normal players come and go, they are just ""meat"" for abusers, who pay money and get what they want.     Every few dozens of mathes you just get disconnected and lose. Every few team macthes your teamate leaves or disconnects and you lose. As soon as you manage to get a small winstreak you get matched with abusers and get a 5-10 game lose strick. Better avoid this lame trash before you get addicted. ""Devs"" who make ""games"" like this should be banned from Steam and gaming industry forever.1000000000000000000000000000 lame greedy devs out of 10.Update: finally I'm done with this sh-ty excuse of a game! Recent update brought a rework of Expeditions and made them essentially useless. Before this rework you could get a lot out of expedition: random cards, several tokens, resources and a lot of gold. And that allowed you to catch up at least a little to those who bought Premium and donates for resources. Now all you get is a small amount of gold + 1 token and you can do only 1 expedition per week. P2W of this game  reached a new hight.Devs are too pu$$y to push any actual changes this game needs in balance, matchmaking or anything, since in their opinion this game needs more players first. So it's up to players to deal somehow with all that buIIsh*t that's going on. And this game's community is absolutely the worst gathering of the worst scumbags I've ever seen in Steam yet. Cause every f-ng abuser scum thinks he is cool and ok just because devs allow it. Notorious for it's toxicity communities of Dota 2 and CS:GO seem rather nice and friendly after this s**thole.

596,SMITE®,2018.0,"One of the worst mobas I have ever played (and I've played pretty much all of them).  THIS GAME IS NOT NEW PLAYER FRIENDLY, IF YOU ARE NEW TO MOBAS, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.The idea is solid, and the gameplay has the potential to be fun, but...1.  Matchmaking is bad, and I mean BAD.  If you are a solo player, don't bother.  You will get matched against premades and pros, one after another until you rage quit.  You will also get the pleasure of being flamed by your team (because the community is mostly salty vets at this point), until you rage quit a second time.  if you are still playing for some reason...2.  Loot boxes have taken over the store.  There was a time when you could just buy skins, not anymore... any worth having are locked behind rng.  3.  The game has a wierd system of forcing a 50/50 win rate even if it means matching you vs players so much better it gaurantees you lose (thus adjusting you back to 50%).  This is a super messed up system, how did it get through development?4.  The graphics and movement are janky by todays standards, not much effort put into overhauling that over the years.  In summary..I REALLY wanted to love this game, but it sees new (and experienced players returning) as foder for the small and pretty savage community to chew up and spit out.   ",0

I followed this game back when it was just an idea that had a few posts about it, and ever since then I've always had hope for this to be a thing. I myself had played and upgraded in all of Artix Entertainment's games; I actually started PC gaming as a whole around the same time I began playing their games (back in early 2007). I've enjoyed every single game they developed, and I can guarantee that this will be no exception. As of now, this game is worthy enough to invest numerous hours into, and it's only in early access (don't look at my hours, I played before AQ3D was even greenlit on Steam).

11841,Neverwinter,2014.0,"First off I need to say I am a huge Dungeons and Dragons fan. I have been since Baldur's gate and the original SSI Goldbox PC games. So, I jumped at the chance to play an MMO of my favorite setting and world. I have not been disappointed at all. If you are hardcore into Faerun lore and enjoy a good D&D themed setting and action MMO combat, then this is the place for you.I've been playing this game nonstop since early June of this year (review written at the end of August). Module 4 has just been released and I am enjoying it a lot. A lot of people say this game is ""pay to win"" and I simply have to say that this is not true. yes, you can buy all the best gear from the in game auction house because most gear is ""bind on use"" instead of ""bind on pickup,"" so if you don't have use for a drop that you win you can sell it on the AH. This, being a free to play game, does have a cash shop, but except for some companions and the more expensive packs (dragonborn pack and hero of the north pack) you cannot buy ""power."" Everything is either cosmetic or utility.One thing I will say is that this game is very solo friendly. Even if you put real money into buying things in this game it is still a grind heavy game. You'll be grinding for weeks (and in some cases months) to get what you want. I personally really enjoy it as it gives me something to always do. The grinds feel involving and fun to me. Each of the different campaigns offers you ways to permanently increase the power of your character over time. The daily areas also have solo dungeons that end in an epic boss fight, so each time you do them it still feels pretty epic, even if you already know what to expect.Leveling in Neverwinter feels more like a typical MMO setup than D&D, but the D&D flavor is still there in everything. The stories are involved and there are several solo dungeons that you'll do in each zone as you're leveling up. These provide an epic single player experience and some of them can be quite challenging (Rime Fang, I'm looking at you). The zones in Neverwinter are somewhat gated and not open world in the slightest. If you've ever played Neverwinter Nights 2 for PC they feel a lot like that. Leveling speed is relatively fast. I was able to reach max level (60) on my first character within 3 weeks. This is an MMO that I will be playing for a very long time. End game group content is a lot of fun and quite challenging. The largest group you'll ever need for anything is 5 people as raiding has not been added to this game yet. However I do have to say one thing bad about this game. DO NOT USE THE IN GAME GROUPFINDER OR LFR CHANNEL TO FIND END GAME GROUPS! The game is unfortunately full of exploiters and gear score elitists that are very very unfriendly towards new players. BUT, there is something you can do! Join the channel /NW_legit_community and form your end game groups in that channel. Sure it might take a while to form a group, but you'll be with the best Neverwinter has to offer. This channel welcomes new players and helps them learn. This channel doesn't care about your gearscore. As long as its high enough to queue for the dungeon that is good enough to get a group in this channel. Its basically the only place outside of my guild that I will form dungeon delves with. The community is entirely player moderated and has been very successful for me. I was lucky that I found that channel shortly after I started playing.My name is Sharastrix@zshikara in game. Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have.",1

8450,theHunter Classic,2017.0,"Love this game. I feel it's probably the best if not is the best hunting simulator out there. The only reason it gets so much hate and negative reviews is because they want you to pay by only allowing 2 free animals to hunt which refreshes every week. On the free side of this game you'll get The bare minimum which will be extremely hard and if you want to play multiplayer, you have to join someone else's room that is a member or some randoms room. On the other hand, I pay for other games ($60 and maybe dlc or premium which is average $50) so what's a couple dollars for a game you enjoy. I started out buying some em$ (ingame money) to buy some gear, and just hunted the free animals. Quickly after doing this I fell in love with the game and bough one of the DLC which came with some gear and the membership and haven't looked back since. It has missions and competitions along with some skills to level up that will keep you busy for as long as you like.  ",1

This game is so boring but I tortrued myself through it becase it says star trek.

You also draw less cards at start of the match.All these changes combined mean the same old cards now perform completely differently than you would remember (paying 1000 LP to activate an effect being 1/4 of your LP instead of 1/8th), also all of your olds decks literally -cannot- be built as  the deck space cap is now lower than the previous deck minimum.So what exactly is the motivation to play this game?

I  most of all don't like the changed rules that apply even on ""Casual""  (i.e. using stopwatch, queueing after every match, no votes to extend/change map, no real choice in maps). Casual is just an unranked version of Competitive. It seems to me this is the height of arrogance, ramming down a mode that a majority or at least a large segment didn't want.

6717,Fractured Space,2014.0,Early Access ReviewThe Game is quite good lots to learn (in terms of your shops +'s and -'s) and keeps you thinking. The leveling process seems to be a bit slow i did really well in a game and only got a few XP for it so it seems like to get to level two would take an age! From what i can see there is currently no options to level up your ship or train crew its a simple fly around kill/ capture and if you do this enough you will earn enough xp or credits? to buy the next ship. It would be nice to be able to level up the crew or even improve on the ship.The interface isnt quite as clear as you would like but this game is in its Alpha stage!I think its a great start to the game and the fact that im hooked on the Alpha says it all!

6887,Robocraft,2014.0,"This game was great in 2014, and after the removal of megabots, things started going downhill from there. It has driven away veteran players because of its unplayable state. Bugs keep on getting added each update and they have yet to fix the Disconnect issue even after 2 years or to cope with it by adding a reconnect button in the first place. The game is driven towards mech now with each other movement type either forgotten about (skis) or good builds, getting nerfs. The arrival of the energy bar already made classic constant fire gameplay until one side messes up a thing of the past. Now its a turn based game with I run out of energy, now its your turn to shoot me. They've added and buffed autoaim weapons to cater to their target audience (10 yr olds) to the game now. They also added crates that you can buy at insanely high prices for a ""chance"" to win legendary items. The currency system has been nerfed with all the rich players having next to nothing and the poor players having nothing and continue to get nothing in the drops. If they really cared about gaining revenue and players, they would listen to the veterans who have been here the longest. Just because I have logged only 700+ hrs on steam doesnt mean I'm a noob. I played a year on standalone because of how bad the game ran on steam, which leads me to another point, they have different fixes for the launchers resulting in one update which buffed and corrected the steam launcher first so I came back to steam. Next thing is, with the ongoing changes, especially to the way damage is dealt and how weapons and movements work, they break your hard tested bots within the next patch. Building a practical build is now somewhat more annoying, although it does offer a challenge to always build the next meta. Some movement types have completely not received a buff or a nerf at all and FJ is constantly implementing new stuff instead of fixing up the old stuff or reworking it, if they couldnt handle it (like the megas) they simply removed it from the game and ended up removing a great chunk of building and players altogether.

1021,Magic Duels,2017.0,"I just read some of the reviews for this game and i just have to say most of them are not quite fair.First the pay to win argumentMany players seem to think it is a pay to win system but that is not the whole truth.I have not spent a single cent at this game, just played the daily quests each third day and evolved my decks in the long turn. My latest Deck was in the PVP ranking around rank 37 without having more than one generation cleared....The real task in this game is not building the absolutely optimized deck, no you just try to build the best of what you have and if you ask me that's much closer to the true Magic feeling than playing in the usual magic store. When I started Magic the gathering I had no billions of dollars to spend for card so I had to play with the cards I got, not the cards I bought on the Internet to fulfill already optimized deck lists made by professional players!!!Instead it makes me proud to defeat players with unlimited resources who buy their cards and have every planeswalker you can get ;)In my opinion its quite clever of the game makers to limit the number of the same rares and mythic rares because it provides a larger diversity of different deck types and inhibits the extreme decks which are just build around a single card.=>This tries to PREVENT pay to win!!!To all the players who say the computer is too hard..... realy? Would you go to a magic store, play against a random guy and complain his deck is to good??? Go on, modify your deck and try it again!This game is designed for the multiplayer! You build your decks and test them against players all around the world! Not just the two decks of your best friend...If you ask me the multiplayer is by far the best magic online multiplayer i have seen and all in all it works quite well.Sure there are bugs sometimes but the turn based magic system (card stack, instant etc.) is just excellent for everyone who wants to learn the rules. Sure you will lose your first battles but there is no punishment for this, and every victory brings you closer to more cards to enlarge your library.Oh, in addition there is a new generation every 4th month and last but not least: IT IS FREE TO PLAY, and if you read my post I hope you will follow my argumentation that it is also FREE TO WIN! (if you learn how to play and improve your skill ;) ",1

1433,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is what MTG:O should have been, easy UI and navigation and gameplay is smooth. As a long time CCG player I truly enjoy this game. Much more strategic than playing on curve as in Hearthstone and not as complex as Magic. Great for new players and veterans alike. As a free to play game I was expecting the worst as a pay to win aspect, but the rewards for free battles against AI can have you crafting decks within the week.

The FFB is feeling great and you can really dial it in to what you like. The sounds are just the best in class right now, really they will just blow you away. The prices are very fair (I got all the cars/tracks I wanted on sale for $30, its $33 for 3 months on iRacing without extras).  Even when not on sale you are looking at $3-$5 per car/track, for the detail in each (looks to feel) well worth it. And if you are into Sim Racing (not gaming) what you get for free will keep you busy for hours. Also works great and looks AMAZING in VR!

696,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017.0,"""Low spec PC is no longer supported.""﻿ wowI loved this game at first, but almost every round I play with trolls, VAC is bad, almost every game I play against spinboters and wallers or aim hackers, I watched replays and yes they were cheating. Never got notified that they got banned as i got once when i had 50 hours. Now I lose every round because i have to carry or enemy is damn good, I dont get good teamates as I would love to, they are too bad for me or 2 strong so i cant get any kills. I hate when i join game and in first half 2 of my teamates leave game. Anything isnt better with Trust mode that was added... I dont get wtf new dust 2 map is, it looks like you just used some parts of Office ( T spawn? ), Inferno ( B site), and Italy + Canals. Tunnels look almost same as tunnels in Aztec, I have to say that my fps isnt that bad for me like for other players it is, I usually have about 45-60fps in dust 2 40-50fps ( And that isnt very bad because I learned how to play on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop. ) Other thing I have to say for Nuke that has 25-35fps which is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and what the hell is minimap and bomb sound on Nuke. I am at B site in doors room ( idk its name but its nice to hide ), and I hear bomb like it is 2 meters from me. I told my teamate that bomb is on B and after about 20 seconds we realized that it is on A... but it was too late gg wp.♥♥♥♥♥♥mapAztec got removed from game and there is achievment that says "" Win 100 rounds on Aztec "". What fu*king idiot removed Aztec and Vertigo from game. Maps werent balanced, true, but that isnt reason to remove them from game. And I dont get it why you dont bring them back with message "" We added removed maps to game because community wanted it. "" And why would you like to remove maps from competitive and make players unhappy? So people have more time to buy skins? Or write long reviews like I am doing now? You are just ruining the game with new updates. And about skins, almost all csgo profit comes from skins because some rich Americans have to buy Dragon Lore ( no hate ). Just imagine war with painted guns, unrealistic. You made skin market with in game inspect from nice tactical FPS game. And knife in game costs 5 more times then real life knife, you are just making people an idiots.Today I playied vs spinboter on Cache, and best thing is that hacker had 1400 gours in game. Idk, maybe he got hack when he had 1200 or 1300 hours, but after 200 hours in game (I just guess) this guy is still playing and ruining other people's fun. After all stupid things and toxic enemies who say ""ez ez ez"" when they win competitive match, especially if they have less kills then worst guy in my team. Also I got kicked for being the best one in game with 32 kills and ofc I got derank... All at all, I hate it because it isnt good balanced. And BOTs arent listening, I dont care about your stupid new shootgun update, like anybody will use shootguns they are sh#t in csgo and cost too much, so could you make BOTs listen and not die in first 20 seconds of the match...but no, shootguns are the most important thing ...I playied Wingman cuz I was bored and I dont get its new ranking system, something changed... Firstly I won 2 games in a row and after that lost and BOOM! I deranked to gn4 from mg1. After that I lost one more time and deranked to gn3, wow!!! After that thingie I won 3 matches and got no rankup and after that lost 1 match and deranked to gn2... WHAT THE F#Ck ?!?!?!?!?!?! I guess this is one more of VALVE'S briliant updates where you cant rankup up in Wingman and can derank if you lose only one match, Im not joking. This is for real and I dont know what is going on, I got matched against silvers as mg1 and that is reason for sure... but those guys play better then some of my friends that are mg2 or mg elite in Wingman... I swear.... They have less then 100 hours and play awesome. Well that is why I deranked wow... I wasnt playing csgo about 1 month, cuz its absolute bulls#it in my opinion. And that is the reason why game gave me to play vs silvers, I guess... and now I have Gold Nova 2 instead of MG1 with win/lose=10 ^_^Also when griefers are in my team they kill me and other teamate and just leave with 30 minutes ban, they got 30 minutes ban and we lost our ranks. That is fu*king nice Valve, fu*king nice. And after griefers leave in 3rd round, later result is 14 - 4 (for enemy)  I abandoned the match and got 24 hour ban. Well yes... Again fu#king nice Valve.One more time I got trolls in team, I found a nice chance to kick 2 of them because other 2 got kicked after they killed me on the start of first 2 rounds. After I kicked 2 of them It was 5v1 and I surrendered. When I came to lobby it said I'm banned for 7 days ""you kicked to many players""?!?!?!?... fu#k you and your stupid game!!!PS: I'm silver elite now and I was silver elite master after 20 hours in game. Logic. I have the most kills every match but I lose because my teamates are disabled idiots. Well... I hope there is someone who has same opinion as me.Sry because bad English :/",0

A disconnect!UX is myth. I swear, browsing the market has never been that hard before! I'd even say that you actually can't browse the market - it feels more like you gotta know nearly everything about the game to find something there. Making a lobotomy to the guy who designed it is now on my bucketlist.Micro-transactions! So you wanna play another class? Just go grind the loot to craft it like a nolifer. Don't wanna spend time grinding? A new class will cost you 5 EUR then. Want a bigger inventory? Maybe a bigger stash? Want to put more items for sale at once on the market? Want to unsocket the gem? Easy - just buy it with your IRL money.The most logical logic brought to you by the best logic programmers ever. You just logged into the game during the coins collection event, there's the entrance portal right in front of you which will get closed in 1 minute. Hop in! Yay, even starts, and will last for 1:30min. But you actually should waste time on it. Because once the portal will get closed and you're still in process of you coins collection run - you'll get no coins in the end. Hey, Trion Worlds, how about not generating the event instance if there's not enough time for its completion so players won't waste their time? Or maybe you should fix the logic instead, mm? Because if I'm in and I'm on it - I'll complete it. And I want my rewards for the time I invested.The most robust mechanics math! Who needs defence parameter? Right - not Trove.

The game started out great in 2010 with some glitches of course. In seven years it turned into a even more amazing and enjoyable game.

15558,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2016.0,"So, this game, when I played it, had one of the greatest player communities I've ever seen. It was absolutely amazing how immersed you felt. Graphics don't matter when you have people who love a game that much.It has been a long time since I've come back to this game, I'm hoping not much has changed, I remember playing it before it was Free to Play, and I was beyond impressed, the more I see other people play other MMO games, or multiplayer games, the more I miss growing my pipe weed, sitting in a tavern, or listening to a player band play their hearts out. I miss exploring the beautiful world that is Middle Earth, and I miss my Dwarven Champion.Not just did this game have an amazing player base, but it also had THE BEST questing I've ever experienced in ANY other mmo game, and in some cases in many other RPG games. I would go so far as to say Lotro defeats The Witcher (Series) and Kotor (1-2), two series I love very much. I remember there was an amazing depth to the game, where, sure you were one player among many, but every adventure felt important, not just your journey to become the strongest, but more your perilous trek to explore this vast world.

777,School of Dragons,2014.0,"Okay... Unlike most of the people who reviewed this game i actually took the time to play it for awhile. I love the concept of this game having a dragon to train a soul-bond and you can only have 1 but it contradicts itself. It say's you can only have 1 dragon that you will bond with, but if you pay for Gems you can have several dragons. You cannot earn the dragon's that cost gem's unless you A. Buy gems Or B buy a membership. I don't really feel like this game is Pay2Win as much as I feel that it is Pay2HaveFunCosmetics. The flying on the dragon's is actually quite fun i was surprised to be having fun just going through the obstacle course. It's not a very explaining game the tutorial is like yeah do this and they expect you to know how to do everything. At one point in this game i got very frustrated because it glitched and it said to feed my dragon a fish, your thinking ok how hard can this be well, when your dragon is nowhere to be seen i have no idea how to feed him. Your dragon will be a derpmonster and walk off several times. And woulden't you expect to fly your own dragon? No you will be flying a dragon called Nightmare or something. Supposedly you can't fly on your dragon till it's out of baby mode and then it does not explain how to get your dragon out of baby mode. I like this game but at the same time I hate it.

Sector strike which offered old tech for ""new"" players to ""catch-up"" are still pay2win even when you are lvl60. 5) lied about nerfing some stupidly overpowered event enemy fleet but NEVER provides any details or statistics about how many health or damage was reduced. they even have the audacity to give steath statistics buff to PVE targets mid-event and it has been proven by many ""comparision"" videos on the Youtube.4) Power Creep in this game is world-record breaking, The game is not just Pay2Win but it is mathematically proven to be Pay2 Progress, new tech is released EVERY 2 WEEKS with better stats than the previous.

It's super nice to have a game that has extensive class-advancement again. It's really good like this.,1
564,Crush Crush,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game becomes exceptionally slow as you progress, and reseting the game to speed things up becomes slow very quickly. This is an early access game that is asking for in game money that you can spend on things that may change with a patch or have lesser effects later. It is kind of cute for a while, but the 'charm' wears off very quickly. All I can say is don't spend any money on this until it is a finished game.",0
19293,SMITE®,2018.0,"Hi-Rez Studios is one of the worst companies that I have ever seen try to balance a MOBA because they don't even try to. They purposefully release new gods in a broken state to ""reward"" those who bought the gods access pass or those who saved to buy the new god. The company is all about a huge cash grab releasing skins in updates to try and distract from the fact that they ignore their community and refuse to balance anything. The game is really only fun if you pickup one of the generic, broken gods that can be played rather than any of the ones with a unique and fun kit because unique and fun just doesn't cut it here, you have to be generic and broken to win. Will never be able to recommend the game until they manage to fix the state it is in.",0
16519,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is one of those games that sounds great in theory but is horrible as an actual game. There is no balance what so ever to the point so few people bother to play the russians cause all their lower end weapons are so bad they can't remotely match up with the other two factions. The grind is really horrible as well to ""encourage"" you to spend money.",0

6306,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2017.0,"An amazing a huge expansive world that is all free. I would put plenty more hours in if I had the time, don't let the early tutorials turn you off, because the rest of the game is absolutely amazing. ",1
14658,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewGame runs very well on my phone and tablet which I have played the majority of hours on.  Even my 4-inch phone is easily playable due to clever interface design.  The game is also synchronized between your devices and steam account.Presentation, artwork, and progression/card collection are derivative of Hearthstone. What this means (if you never heard of Hearthstone) is that the ""cards"" animate themselves on the game board so it's easy to tell what their doing (attacking creatures smack the enemies, flying creatures hovering, spells shooting across the battlefield).  Not much is left to imagination (as would be the case in physical card games) which helps new players keep track of what's going on.  Card artwork skews toward ""cartoony"" but not in a childish way.  Admittedly I'm not a fan but that's personal taste.Players earn cards through gameplay or opening packs but cannot trade with other players.  At the time of this review, the first PvP win of the day rewards a pack of cards.  This is an extremely generous way for players to complete their collection of common and uncommon cards with minimal grind.  Rares and legendaries will still require grinding or $$.The gameplay itself is derivative of MTG.  So expect 5-color, playing resources, defender choosing who blocks, and instant spells on opponent's turn.  There are many keywords that take advantage of the digital space like warcry and echo.  Eternal features PvE modes but they feel more like a temporary thing to train up until you're ready to PvP.I'm giving this game a thumbs up because:- easy pick up and play- well-polished presentation- strong support for mobile devices- room for complexity and growthNow for the issues...-Many players complain about the MTG style resource system that causes some games to be unplayble due to not drawing enough or too many resources.  The mulligan system and certain cards try to mitigate this, but it is still there.  Expect power screw, but no worse than MTG.-75 card minimum deck reduces consistency.  This can cause deck building to lean toward high quality cards that are strong regardless of the deck instead of weaker cards that better synergize with the deck.-There is also a massive power disparity between legendary cards and uncommon/commons.^ These two points may be how Direwolf plans to $$ players towards legendaries, and how they can practically give away common/uncommons.-Eternal requires an internet connection to play, even to PvE or tinker with decks.",1
18178,School of Dragons,2015.0,"Love this game. So many things you can do in it, like fishing or fireball frenzy. And you can train multiple dragons if you have diamonds. I haven't seen any bugs or glitches in the game as well. If you love How to Train Your Dragon, you MUST get this game.",1
897,Fractured Space,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is not bad; It feels like an interstellar version of ""World of Warships"" with large amount of strategy element, but they need to optimize it even further, it's been a year since the launch, so I think this can be eliminated rather easily.All in all I'm willing to give it 9/10. -1 due to bad optimization/low FPS in the hanger; say, what can be better when you can actually fight with a member from the development company?",1

5026,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"This card game feels like it is actually trying to break the mold and move away from the more traditional trappings of TCGs. I love the ""lane"" system where you have essentially multiple boards to play on at once. If you like Elder Scrolls, you will not regret at least trying it out.",1
10873,War Thunder,2016.0,"Product received for free        After playing this game for two years I sadly must give it a poor review. Although, let's keep it in perspective it is a ""free"" game with options to ""pay"" for upgrades. So is it really free then?         I have read the reviews about the different tanks and planes...blah blah blah....try the ones you like don't drive the ones you don't like, move on.  So my complaints aren't about the game when it works.         The key issues that have driven me to this poor review are as follows:         1) War Thunder downloaded many maleware files onto my computer, and continues to date, which drives my maleware detector crazy. Why would this gave try and install maleware on my computer unless it was trying to steal something from me. My question is this, why would Steam even allow a game that installs malware on its site.         2) War Thunder sends out daily downloads. Is their software so buggy they have to send out daily updates? Really! I understand wanting to fix bugs and add new feature but every day! Come on.         3) The straw that broke the camels back for me was constant drops from the War Thunder server. I checked my own settings to ensure it wasn't on my side and it wasn't. But after getting booted from a number of games because of servers disconnects, it has finally driven me away from War Thunder.         The moral of the story is this. You get what you pay for. If ""free"" game performance is lousy and frustrating then it isn't really free. Oh and by the way, yes I did ""pay"" for ""golden eagles"" to improve my upgrade performance. So it wasn't really free for me.  ",0
11272,War Thunder,2018.0,"Asking to fix the game equates to free abrams aparently. In short this corporation that runs the game is trash, and will only waste your time with grinding in the game. Don't bother. You will never reach top teir unless you pay, or play the game obsessivly.",0
12785,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2018.0,Hearthstone clone with nothing unique about it. Punishes players for attacking into each other creating boring gameplay. Bethesda's destruction of the elder scrolls series continues in full force with no signs of stopping anytime soon.,0
7175,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThe most realistic fishing game available to date.  Just like in real life, you don't catch anything for 20 minutes and decide to drink beer to pass the time.  Then you realize you're actually playing a fishing game on your $2,000 gaming computer and have thoughts of suicide.  Suddenly, your bobber starts to twitch...you try to set the hook and it doesn't work.  That moment of excitement is quickly dashed by the sudden return of suicidal thoughts.  You drink more beer to make yourself feel better about the fact that, again, you're using 21st century technology to catch virtual fish.  At this point, depression starts to set in.  Your dreams of being the digital Bill Dance are quickly fading.  Then out of nowhere, you get a bite and set the god damn hook!  ""That ♥♥♥♥ing fish is mine"", you say under your breath.  What's that?  Your line snapped?  Better drink more beer to forget what just happened.  All in all it's a great game.",1

19705,VEGA Conflict,2016.0,"It does seem interesting, at first and looking at the youtube playthrough/guides videos. However, once I started the game, I realised that game progression and 1 module are hidden behind a pay wall which you can't unlock unless you actually pay. So much for ""free play"". Ok so let's talk about that. Microtransactions seem designed to offer better returns if you make smaller, regular transactions, rather than big ones. Which should be fine for most players.  So far so good. Certain actions that are needed for progression (like building/upgradin modules, researching) are massively impacted by what you can purchase, which can speed up your progression. That's not so good.  Things that impact your survivability, like ship repairs and even their speedy build times are also unfairly impacted by what you can buy in the game. Not cool. Overall progression is way too slow for my taste and had it been any smoother, I might have been tempted to play more and maybe even pay (I don't want to give them any ideas), but as it is now, I wouldn't even bother. Game design is not that good either. The overall idea is nice and they have some interesting, elements, but it's an obvious shameless money grab. Don't like it one bit and it's simply in your face: not enough resource, click here to get more. The UI is not intuitive enough, no tool-tips, no warning when spending stuff that you might need later on (though actions can be cancelled in a timely fashion and you get resources back). I haven't realised in the first 30 min how to properly arrange my base, just with the info available in-game. Not cool. Please have the decency to stay away from this one and others like it. Had they came up with more gameplay and less annoying pay-us-money shameless tactics, I would have been ok-er with it, messing around, but the way it is calls for a single verdict: stay away from this one!",0

2101,War Thunder,2015.0,"04.05.2015Short Summary: play Russian or get Rekt!and you will get banhammered 100% if you say ANYTHING negative (not even slander, just some negative comment is enough!) on their forum or website - typical russian attitude.---Long Summary:could have been a good game but russian/tanks and planes are totally op... who would have guessed, devs are russians.don't bother start as any other faction than russian. for russians the game surely is fun smacking everyone and everything...should they ever change that and balance the russian faction to be in line with the others i will change this review... lol but i guess hell freezes over before that day...*edit:on a second thought i guess this review will stay negative forever, since some funny mods deleted a thread of mine where i pointed out the massive ongoing bias during the current WW2 chronicels event.background:german facion is outnumbered on every single match and having worse tier tanks aswell, which climaxed yesterday in a 8v12 SB and 10vs13 RB thats just super dumb.it started on 10vs12 and was already hard but their beloved russians still lost some games. so they changed it to 8vs12 which completely crushed german faction.historical you say? i would too, but they did the same on ever single day of the event. even during the poland invasion, ""poland"" pictured as soviets outnumbered the germans 15v10 and it was unwinnable. loloh and did i mention censoring? every issue whitch reflects their bad work on updates or stuff where they create more imbalance than before on their forum and in the steam group is being almost immediately deleted or locked and put in archive without any reason given.if they would just communicate with the playerbase once they could have really easy solutions for long lasting problems, but they prefer not to get involved and banhammer everything instead - just russian style.day by day the same shít...---16.07.2016Tried an Event - T54 vs CenturionIn short British 3x 6.7 tanks vs Russian 7.3, 7.7, 8.0You may imagine the matches were full off Russian tanks and nowhere a Brit tank to be seen...But no Russian Bias right?... this is so big time BS---Having several factions unlocked I can now draw direct conclusions. The deeper you get into this game the more and more biased it gets.Some really biased and game ruining hard facts:- Fire on Russian planes extinguishes like 95% of the time, it burns a while keeps flying and then viola fire is out magically *Russian magik fire extinguisher*. All other nations just burn down 95% of the time...- Hit russian tanks into ammo rack or fuel often nothing happens... nothing! hit other nations on same place, instakill!!- Kill the commander on a german tank, even if gunner still lives the tank will not be able to shoot at you anymore. Kill a russian commander.... nothing tank can fire normally.- Kill German gunner while reloading, gunner is replaced and reloading starts from anew. Kill Russian gunner during reload, reloading continues from the point where it was before the gunner died :)- Russian IT1 missile has an obvious bug and can fly trough solid buildings and walls wich you can't penetrate with tank shells or any other missile carriers. It's been reported months ago, still no fix and I don't think it ever will be...- Gunners on Bombers lol, British, German and Jap gunners on full level are fairly useless. They hardly hit planes chasing you on 300m.Russian gunners are of course all pro snipers, hitting planes on 1km and taking them down rather easily. Not sure how many kills I made on Russian Bombers, but it's an ridiculous amount. I'd be really curious to see stats about that...US Bombers are soso, due to immense turret numbers they may hit sometimes too and take chsing planes down. But just sometimes.- General game mechanic problem, the better you play (currently 87% avg position here) the more you get uptiered. In solo queue without my ""not so good"" clan members I get uptiered into +1 Br like 9/10 matches. So you end up playing the whole match as AAA since your tanks are mostly useless in +1 games.",0
