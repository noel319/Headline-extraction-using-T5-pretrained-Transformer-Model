12053,Infestation: The New Z,2016.0,"Unbelievable that this rehash copy and paste trash is allowed to be on steam.   Infestation SS continued what WarZ started and all this ""NEW"" game does is cover up the fact that this is quite simply another cash grab from Sergay Titoff using a different dev team but still under his guidance.  Sergay still owns OP Productions LLC under Arktos Entertainment Group LLC, this is just another cash grab.I was wondering why Infestation SS was brought back in this new form Infestation The New Z.  The reasons I believe is to add more funds to his other newish project Shattered Skies, soon to follow up with Last Man Standing.  Shattered Skies has suffered financially because of lack of new buyers put off by the negativity, which is well deserved.   Sergay promised that Shattered Skies would not have microtransactions, he's kept his word.  So my question would be where will you get the revenue to keep his main project afloat???  As I stated above to get more money you bring back a rehash/copyandpaste Infestation but with the added bonus of in your face microtransactions.The way microtransactions work the I:The New Z is easy.  Buy some GC for real money, use the GC to buy cosmetic items, you can also use the GC to buy ingame $ which can be used to buy anything ingame, from servers to vehicles.  56000 GC will cost you $99 real money.  I could only play Infestation The New Z for a short amount of time but enough to have first impressions, its ShitZ.  If you played Warz, or any of the previous titles you won't be surprised.  Same everything, same engine and assets.  I:TNZ also suffer's from cheating, cheats/hacks are out there and are used in game.  Fred the CEO of Fredaikis AB should know all about hacks.While I'm here take a look at these:-http://forum.willyousurvive.com/index.php?/topic/9662-romero%E2%80%99s-aftermath-end-of-service-announcement/http://forums.infestationworld.com/index.php?/topic/163444-important-announcement-about-infestation-world/http://steamcommunity.com/app/226700/discussions/0/208684375433081721/ The reason, no money, thats the reason this has been released.Presenting Infestation The New Z, here to rip you off like the other titles.Enjoy",0
12536,SMITE®,2015.0,"I can't recommened this game in its current state...Nobody in casual matches has a proper grasp on how to play, and almost everyone is plain toxic.Furthermore, Matching-making is a nightmare. The Dev team recently added ""prestige levels"" for players to level up passed the previous level 30 cap, but I just use it to see who I'm being put up against in a match. Myself, a level 127 player, has constantly been placed against people below level 100, and it gets a little bit frustrating.Smite's main gamemode, Conquest, is the least played gamemode because of it's drastic and impossible learning curve. Only players who have been playing since day one, and have been evolving with it can properly play. Conquest in it current state is much too ""snow-bally"" to be an enjoyable experience, and the worst thing is. Most of the people on the deisgn and balance team don't even play Ranked! It's absurd! Not to mention too much time and effort goes into skins...Also, every other God release is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. A lot of them end up being eye-candy Godesses, to pander to the new, younger men playing the game. And their ability kits suffer because of it, with little to no synergy in them at all. It's just heartbreaking that it's gotten this bad, compared to the old design team's releases.Lastly, Osiris hasn't been nerfed yet. A character that has been overpeforming at the mid and highest level of play, hasn't been nerfed yet because of his underperformance in casual matches.So, yeah... Maybe wait until it gets a new Lead Designer, or until Season 5. It's supposed to be great! But I'm not getting my hopes up.",0
747,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is constantly evolving; some addition good, some bad. There are a lot of people who don't like it, and I get it. Ive got 350 hours in the game, and when I ever have a large streak of kills, I could understand the anger from my victims. 2 years ago, the game was not like this. Literaly everyone was at the same level, so grinding was a piece of cake. As time passed, more and more people got better weapons, and that was that. Then a surge of people joined, and once they reached level 5, they were put into games with experience players, (such as I) all with one shot rifles up to an insane range. Guilty as charged. And it does not stop at the rifles. Even pistols can be upgraded to be a 3 shot kill at 50m. Also guilty as charged. So anyone who says the game is ""Pay to Win"", is partialy right. But it was not always that way. I had my friends play with me, and they were very angry at how the starting weapons are absolute garbage, and that they were dying too easily. The game has so much potential, but it is really only fun for people who have played for long enough. TLDR;The game is at this point, a pay to win.Still fun to play though.",0
3214,World of Warships,2018.0,"I play this game because it scratches an itch. It looks good and play is smooth and relatively simple. What ruins it is:- High Tier economy is dead. You lose money. (This worked at launch, when there were only two nations - it doesnt anymore.)- Matchmaking is a mess. Stacking ridiculous numbers of Destroyers, and two Carriers per team is highly controversial in the community.- Torpedo quantity ingame is hugely excessive. - XP being based off how much damage you do.Destroyers in particular get a lot of hate for these problems, but the developer has a MASSIVE HARDON for them and Torpedos which keeps them the meta.",0
4036,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2016.0,"Finally, a game for people like us to enjoy! Put aside your copy of Mein Kampf, turn off the imported torture/scat porn movie from Japan that you're watching, close the skylight curtains to your basement flat and obsess over the assembly and disassembly of a wide variety of firearms. For hours. Hopefully they'll release DLC where we can repeatedly enact shooting people before chopping them up and storing their body parts in the fridge. 10/10 would masturbate again.",1
8856,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,"I would recommend this game a lot, it is fun and action packed. My only issue is when your in a tier 4 light tank for example, and then the game puts you in against a tier 5 heavy tank. How the hell am i going to win??? and I once had a time when i was in a tier 5 heavy, against another tier 5 heavy, and It took me about 20 shells to kill him, but that same tank killed me in one hit, how does that work???? And basically all the time, i would drive forward by holding down the W key, but my tank wouldn't move. then about 10 seconds later my tank would start moving and it wouldn't stop. it's the same with my steering, i tap the A key for 2 seconds and then my tank would drive in circles constantly. This game is great but It  has it's issues.",1

15917,WARMODE,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewA great game for it's valueAltough all the hate/troll reviews out there this game is not that bad, it is actually kinda good and fun when you start playing it. The only thing this game needs is better servers?(you will often see player models do some mini teleports or rubberbanding) AND no balance :D witch is something I actually thing makes this game fun to play because there is almost no recoil in the guns enabling you to headshot so easily. ",1
8362,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe gameplay is fun. The weapons feel good.However. That is the end of the good.The progression now is completely luck-based. Meaning one person who puts 50 hours in could possibly have better gear than someone who puts 500 hours in. That, my friends, is Bull****.On top of that. The Devs have been scummy. A friend of mine was silenced (Cannot use chat) because they complained about the luck-based progression. They got offended and decided to silence said friend for ""Profanity"" reasons.I don't reccomend this game, especially after ALL of the progression changes as updates go by, and the sensitive devs who cannot take criticism.Don't bother with the game. There's a lot better games out there to play than this one.",0

1091,Star Trek Online,2014.0,very awesome game. even though i play it through a game client called ARC. its still pretty fun to play. doesnt take long to level up. i leveled my Klingon guy from 1 to about 44 in less than a week. pretty fun to play. alot of people play it. i recommend it!,1
592,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Do not recommend to buy it, game is kinda broken at the moment: lots of restirictions to f2p, broken trade system, no sociality, amount of bugs like in first beta tests, huge lags and devs who not responde to players community",0
2267,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewMy Steam account only has 300~ hours but I have probably 500 on mobile.The game is getting eaten alive about RedShell even though it's been removed before the outrage even began.This is a true free-to-play card game. Within a week or so you will have a great deck and able to hit the top of the ranks if you are skilled enough. Don't let the reviews turn you off, it's a free game and you only have time to lose by playing.",1
2346,Neverwinter,2014.0,"Neverwinter Online is a decent enough game but is not anything close to actual D&D.  The game is more of a standard MMO with a D&D stamp or veneer over it.  The quests are very repetitive and have little variation between them.  The Foundry feature, which allows players to create their own quests for the community's use, has some good quests but this tool has not lived up to its potential.  NWO has an interesting skills system and the wide number of hirelings and mounts improve the game to some degree, but overall the game is disappointing and lacks long term playing potential.",0
9136,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"Since the recent match making update, you have to wait a good 15 minutes before actually entering a match on ""casual"" mode. Once the match is over (keep in mind a match can last as little as 10 mintues sometimes) you're forced to find a new game. The matchmaking takes longer than the actual game with recent experience, so i honestly can't recomend this game while it's like this, as even community servers force ads on you",0
2197,Neverwinter,2015.0,"Its a fun run of the mill mmo, slash'em up game. If your a hardcore D&D fan then im sure you'll find lots to hate, considering lore, and gameplay. Otherwise its a HUGE pay-to-play. The gold you get ( wich has the copper, silver, gold system) will only buy you the low level items, and some potions. The astral diamonds are used to buy better items, decent mounts, and deccent companions, but can only be gained through special task, such as daily missions. These are pains to do and in the end its usually not worth the work. The zen, a.k.a. the money you but with real money, is used to get the advantage while going anything. That means buying good items, good mounts, and good companions. All of these things being pretty important. Its such a pay to play, that all of the steam DLC's cost $450. Yep, thats right, 450 frickin dollars. Besides that, the combat is fun, and the game has some nice graphics, but there is the issue of everything else.4.5/10",0
7650,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is a very good remake of the normal AdventureQuest. It brings back memories where I play with my friends just to level up and hang out. Ah, the good times.I'll rate it ★★★★✩",1
640,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,"Sakura Clicker is...

Yep, TWO THUMBS UP!!",1
2449,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewSurprisingly in depth.  Still a work in progress so I am interested to see where they go with the game (boats, saltwater fishing, etc).  Pulling up bluegills with a bobber at lvl 1 will not amaze you, but if you feel inclined to stick with it to lvl 3 or so and start catching catfish and bass you will be rewarded.",1

2051,Black Squad,2017.0,"Early Access Review-Black Squad-I really did not expect it to be this good, I thought It was just going to be another pay to win game and really bad graphics/movement, but nope, I was wrong.This game is beautiful looking and has a ""almost"" csgo/css movement.The weapons are really great decorated.Just that 1 shotgun called ""KSG""... Is just a little TOO overpowered, maybe they've already fixed the shotgun by the time YOU read this.But the final results, oh btw, It's Early Access, WELL, the final results.I SO recommend this game, I have a ""NVIDIA GTX 960"" Graphic Card, and I have all the settings on max (Ultra)and I have around 150FPS all the time, very well made game for a FREE TO PLAY! :)Play it!",1
7582,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewHi-Rez applied a patch that turned a solid/different BR game into a game of 'who gets the best lottery luck from chest drops'. The core game is fun, but as of right now the game is not enjoyable at all.",0

1943,Star Trek Online,2015.0,"This game was fun for a time.  Then, I tried to get my second ship.  I got a free token for another ship and went to turn it in and both the OK and CANCEL buttons did the same thing...nothing.  My token was gone and no new ship.  So, I played for a few days and built up enough Dilithium to purchase the Cruiser ship (15000).  I went to purchase the ship, my Dilithium disappeared and in the chat window it said I received the Cruiser, but sadly no ship.Granted, I was using a free account, but if free accounts are not allowed a second ship, why does my Ship Slots show 5 available and both my token and Dilithium were depeleted?  What's worse is the bug reporting system wouldn't let me notify the developers of this issue.  Shotty programming guys.  If you would have kept me happy on the free account, I would have became a paying member, but I don't think I want to waste anymore time or ANY money on this product.",0

19199,School of Dragons,2016.0,"HEy guys! Well I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to list some things that are bad but lets start with the good things.Pros:1. Get to ride a dragon/free roam2. train a dragon also get to race on it 3. This game is kinda good for Unity Personal :P4. Clans, clans give you the choice to feel good about your self (Or bad depends on the rank)5.Battle events! They actually give you a chance to earn gems, dragon eggs or farm items OR EVEN MYSTERY BOXES :D6. Animation updates at least every 3 weeksCons:1. Some animations are severly broken2. Graphics from The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind (So pretty bad) MY EYES.3. Quests that make you pay money to buy a gronkle WTF4. No dialogue options to choose what you wanna say instead of going along with it on quests5. Clan hacking/Account hacking. I am scared as I am a top racer, well known and in a top clan.6. Chat filters! They are just plain annoying you cant say bruh but you can say drugs with dots inbetween??7. ""We need cashhhh to please ze Senpai"" -Jumpstart 2016.

12403,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access Reviewhave a fair amount of time invested in the game. played off and on for over a year now and enjoyed it early on but there are some things that have turned me off completely and the biggest of those is the a$$hole that work for freejam. read for yourself...then you decide if you want to help them be successful as i will never look at another game that this company makes aslong as d0uchebags like this work and speak for the company...  https://twitter.com/sebify/status/726373014854615040 ,0

3711,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,When i heared Last year there was gonna be a card game for Elder Scrolls i thought it was gonna be lame but then 6 months ago i decided to download it and play it and figure ill give it a chance i was really suprised about how good it was and i never liked hearthstone but this game surprised me. I think its a better version of heathstone.For everyone who asks if its P2W or not. I have been playing for a long time now and ill tell you right now it is not. you can get a lot of good cards in the game without paying a $ only thing you will pay for is stories or if you dont have patience and want shortcuts you can buy card packs and see if you get lucky.,1
2351,Crush Crush,2017.0,"If you don't want to read the rest of this review, the takeaway is this: the game rocks and you should be playing it. Here's why. The gameplay is fun and charming. Keeping in mind, I'm not a gamer or an expert in that field, more serious or professional gamers could take my review with a grain of salt. But I'm an everywoman. I like what I like, and I like this game. If there's one thing that I know pretty well from my near-decade of loneliness before I met my current girlfriend, it's dating simulators. I play almost exclusively dating simulators. Now you may look in my library and say ""oh, there's HuniePop, but you have 8k hours on Skyrim!"" Wrong. I have 8k hours on Serana Volkihar Dating Simulator. ""You have a lot of hours on XCOM 2!"" Got the mod that let your soldiers date. You get the picture. Crush Crush is a delightful dating simulator that allows you to be a lesbian that dates other women that are, from the writing, written to be explicitly bisexual AT LEAST. In fact, in my hours of meticulously combing through every girl's dialogue click by click, there are several references to being attracted to other women and only one or two referencing specific attraction to dudes.Which leads us to the writing, the real meat of any dating sim. It's charming and sweet and while there are a few spots where it's immersion-shatteringly obvious that the dialogue is written by a man and a line or two here and there that get too meta/self-depricating, for the most part I'm happy to say that it's host to some of the most delightful characters that I have ever come across. It's easy to cringe at first - during the early relationship stages, most girls are one-dimensional stereotypes - but as your relationships progress and the girls open up, each one is pretty true to the type of woman they each represent. Spoilers here, but I found myself begrudgingly nodding along during the Dark One's later-stage dialogue. Exceptional mechanic for a boss fight and a cute, relatable goth. I felt called out (in a good way)!Speaking of individual characters, my girlfriend and I both became endeared towards certain characters. I do feel a bit bad, because while my girlfriend is an athletic gamer (I know, what a freakishly powerful human that I love and fear) it was Bonnibel that captured my heart and earned my Diamond Ring with her tender and romantic dialogue. My girlfriend is smitten with Nutaku (who we affectionately call Nut) which is a relief for me because that's pretty much how I flirt anyway. Point is, there's really a girl for everyone; they're not just cookie cutter tropes. Okay maybe they are, but those cookies are baked with meticulous care and decorated creatively.And how can we talk about decoration without talking about the beautiful detail and care that went into these girls' art? I'm actually not that big of a fan of anime-style artwork but this game's art style took my breath away. There's not even a hint of same-face syndrome in the game and even a lot of the nsfw art (easily available on their website for dirt cheap if you're not an idiot and can operate a search engine) is diverse and realistic. Well, as realistic as anime style can be. They all still suffer from the unfortunate boob size ratio of big-bigger-biggest (srsly Elle ily darling but my back hurts just looking at you) but as my girlfriend wisely says, all boobs are good boobs. All in all, though, the artwork was an absolute breath of fresh air from the stale quagmire of media with naked women drawn by talented artists that have never seen a naked woman in their lives.On the subject of stale quagmires in media as well, I have to go back to the writing. I know I'm picking over the writing in depth, but as a storyteller myself, it's really important to me, especially media that is conscious of three audiences: typical, target, and potential. Typical audience is gonna be cis straight men, probably gamers. Target audience is... actually hard to tell and for that I give credit where credit is due, because that means that they're mindful of their potential audience. I'm obviously a lesbian and I really enjoy dating games where I don't get broken from immersion by having to say ""aww, this is for guys."" Instead it is masterfully written in a way that the protagonist could be any gender and find something that seems quite natural to them in a way that I haven't seen since I read Jeanette Winterson's ""Written on the Body.""The story, as well, is something new and exciting. I won't spoil it, but there is a story. And no, not just the typical ""wow! you're lonely! Have sex with these women! Now you're still lonely in real life haha so meta!"" that I see as the plot of a lot of romance games. These girls actually seem to care for you, Marshmallow seems to care for them, they all know about one another and are happy and comfortable with it (for the most part) and the plot draws you in and gives the game a solid, satisfying ending. Even after that, there's still the best part - spending those sweet, sweet diamonds on a wedding dress to give to your waifu. And then scooting over to let your girlfriend drop your diamonds on hers. Everybody's happy.My biggest complaint by far is something nobody but me even really cares about - Marshmallow. She gets SO few customization options (and I like what hobbies do to her, btw, that's genius) but I put my dumb lil ponytail on her and pretended it was an undercut and worked my butt off to get her somewhat nice looking and still she was the exact same in all the cutscenes. I don't know what I really want here - a broader range of customization, for my customizations to reflect in-game, whatever, but I still found myself really wanting more from that. I imagine that would be a thing if they had a bigger budget, so... let's get them that bigger budget!All in all, it was a beautiful, charming game and I'm still loving it after I finished it. I cannot wait to see what more comes from this studio and these developers. Also if Sad Panda Studios is reading this, I'm begging you to bring back Bonnie in the visual novel. Or even Nina? Please? XOXO, Emily.",1
6508,Magic Duels,2017.0,This Game is no longer being updated or supported by its Developers.I liked how it was free to play and you could earn cards for free.What i Disliked before and the reason I DO NOT RECEMEND it now is this games pitifully small card pool of only the most recent expansion sets ever since Wizards of the coast made new Expansion sets 2 blocks per year instead of the Traditional three.Not a big deal until June 2017 the Devs Announced no more expansions for this game which means no more new cards.They couldve at least Completed the newest set but for what ever reason they didn't realease the second half of the Egyptian expantion. I Understand that a company needs to move on after a time but next time Wizards Finish what you start. Dont just leave a story arc half done.,0

2214,Bless Online,2018.0,"The current state of bless is lacking in many of it's content compared to the time given to develop, price tag, and relative success in other areas.In my opinion heres the facts:- The game though pretty fun early on, lack content for late game- The game lacks content, especially when compared to with the jap. version- Although updates and content are being added, it's just too slow and little- The royal quests and gem fragments are not worth it compared to the effort needed- Some of community is leaving so that is going to leave a void for Groups and PVP -For a new player is very unfriendly with a community of ""hardcore gamers"" who will never help. Instead of helping newcommers, they will do a 5 man dungeon with 2-3 ppl. Because most of the ppl left are way, way too overgeared but they want more, because is nothing else to do, I guess.Also ""big"" guilds recrute ppl not to help them but to find players to boost guild points. Terrible community.If you're looking to get this game hold off until the price comes down to $10 or less I hope  for the people that did spend a lot of money Steam will give a refund not only to the streams but to all for such a blunder but I am not holding my breath.",0

8513,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWay more polished than pubg, also free. The main thing to know is what differences it has compared to other games in the genre. -You get a starting loadout and there are actual spawn points. You choose your spawn during the the 1 minute setup and you can see where other players are spawning as well. The spawns are well spaced out. This coupled with the starting equipment means that the start of the game is less insane than other BR games. You never feel like you're taken out before you have a chance to play. Even in the inevitable city frenzies, everyone will have a chance to loot a house before it kicks off.-The travesal equipment is the most unique thing about this game. With each loadout you get a gun, a piece of equipment (medkit, extra ammo, ect..), and a mobility item. You have a choice between hang glider, snowboard, and climbing kit. With the hanglider you can leap off of any ledge and not only land safely but get a boost of speed in the direction you were going.  Snowboard allows you to move at vehicle speeds on any downward slope. Finally the climbing gear allows you to climb at special places on the map that other players would have to take the long way around. The climbing gear isn't really as fun, but they counter that by starting you with a shotgun.-Finally you are not fighting till the last man/team standing. You are trying to board a chopper with only 4 seats. However, most of the time it still turns into a last man/team standing game. But the fact that if you can create enough chaos you might be able to climb that ladder without being blasted adds a bit of spice to the end game.",1

I could do that, and I was going to, but then I thought why should I? It is not as though any of that is going to somehow prove my opinion that the game is ""no longer fun"" more or less valid.",0
1412,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,"Early Access Reviewi was looking forward to dungeon defenders at first , and when i saw it on sale i was like YEY LETS TRY IT OUT! i got online and was like now uhhh wheres my tavern and found out its all online so you cant just sit in your tavern and chill .

9875,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewRobocraft...........I can only say that it is among the single most fun mmo I have ever played. I have played alot of mmo's and they all suffer from the same thing.....Best Builds. A build or a set of builds that can beat all others in pvp and pve. Robocraft does not have this. Some builds are better then others in one thing and crappy in another. It is very much up to the player to decide how they want to play and while you can grab a tutorial or buy a bot (the pay to get bots are usually really crappy and serve mostly as a fun cosmetic thing rather than a viable build to play) there is trillions of ways to build a bot. I am almost in tier 10 myself and i have seen planes with wheels or cruisers that can hover. Tanks with legs and so much more.While there aren't many play modes each battle is different. One battle you will get utterly crushed and the next the timer click to 0 because you were too evenly matched and got a long battle. The variations in bots and tactics make it very fun. The devs are polite kind and helpful. Ususally offering a day of free premium every once in awhile. If the servers crash they work tirelessly to get them back up. They care about the players and seem pretty determined to avoid a pay 2 win model.But don't take my word for it, go in there and play fr yourself.......be warned though you will probably get addicted to it.",1
6027,PlanetSide 2,2018.0,"I originally played this game a few months at launch in 2012 never really got into it and my squad migrated to other titles.A few weeks ago a friend of mine just getting into PC gaming was telling me how much he ejoys this game and started pressuring me to play.  I finally caved, and couldn't be happier I did.  I've even convinced a half dozen other squad members to revist this title and were having a BLAST!- The massive battles are just AWESOME- The small skirmishes are just as exciting!- The amount of weapons and class configurations is limitless!

2192,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"I got mixed feelings about this game .On one hand this is more complex HS, on other hand this is still simple and very basic card game with tons of RNG like HS.So again, fun to play and annoying casual friendly experience at same time . Probably worst thing i noticed so far is power creep on legendary cards. Seriously some legendary cards are bonkers and you can have 3 copies of one card in deck ( unless card is Unique, than only one )Most best decks have tons of legendary and epic cards, and believe me they are usualy much better for same mana cost than lower rarities or cards from older sets .This is fun free to play card game you either invest a lot of time or wallet to be competitive .I cannot take this game seriously as daily game becouse RNG and power creep, but ES Legends is worth playing .EDIT :  I forgot to mention this game have super annoying Blink\Flash of light everytime card is played or something happend on board, if you have senstitive eyes like me, prepare yourself sunglasses or you will need medical attention .",1

12793,Dungeon Defenders II,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst 2hrs, already impressed. In my opinnion for its current stage is a big improvement from DD1. Hopefully when its on its final release the anti-cheat will stop the hackers. Since it will be free. So far I rate it 8/10. Great game! Must buy if you got the cash!^ 12/13/2014------ Updated Review.Now for a better review as I have more game time.Straight off we will start yes this game is lacking some very needed functions or should I  say core elements for the game, as trading or even just to drop items in your tavern should be in but I am just going to leave that as it's still in Pre Alpha.As you journey on playing the difficulty ""Normal"" on some levels if you are new or unexperienced, the levels seem to be some what difficult for someone new to the game. If you are playing alone that is. As again you are meant to play with people, More people more chance of bonus loot(better loot) 4 Players becomes a large chance of good loot.From DD1, I can say that the towers have been nerfed? That don't seem to feel do as much damage as I would rather expect. I was suprised when they had said there wasn't going to be PvP, slightly dissapointed but it isn't that much of a big deal as I got the game to play with friends. Graphics:In my opinnion I think they are a lot better then the previous dungeon defenders and truly like the new graphcs! But again I miss the more cartoony side of the old DD not sure if that makes sense but can't really explain it. - Overall: 7.5/10Maps:Great maps, so far loved all of them! each map is unique and some what different in a way wether your helping crystals or just a cart. Overall: 9/10AI:AI are great, so far there are some great monsters/enemys to verse in DD2, they have annouced there will be more enemys which is great and excited about that! overall: 6.5/10Towers:So far I've played as Monk, Apprentice and Squire. From what my experiences have been the towers lack power as they had more power in DD1. other then that I really like the desings of some towers that are in the current DD2. Overall 5/10Taverns:It can be quite confusing as there is an ""Entry Tavern"" and a ""Private Tavern"" (Not sure if there was a public tavern as I played in private groups) And going to the war recruiter is a bit annoying as if you have a player thats 1 level below the war recruiters you can't play, I guess it's to stop boosters? Eh overall: 6/10Inventory:Inventory is really basic at the moment all though, the ""Temporary bag""(if your bags full it goes there) just seems to be endless and you can keep getting items not sure if that was intetnional or what. Inventory can be a bit buggy, you can purchase a ""Small Bag"" for $10,000 In-game Credits and a ""Large Bag"" for $50,000 In-Game credits. I am not sure if I like this or not, I haven't purchased one as I don't need it. But seems pretty cool. Each item you get can be transferred to other characters ( just stays in your inv) which is handy as same does your money transfers across, I am not sure what happened but a mate and I both got the game at the same time, played same time and he ended up with $40,000 and I had $13,000 but had collected close to same amount of coins laying around. Not sure what happened. Overall 8.5/10Money system:I like how they approched this, insted of Mana being your currecny it's gold. Which is great! Overall: 8/10Overall:Still think with everything I have mentioned it is a fun game, and it is great to participate in the development of this game. Rating:7/10Worth Buying?:Yes and no. It all really depends on yourself. Do you want to support or just wait?If you want to help development then sure go right ahead, but aside that there are a lot of bug's that will be fixed in the near future hopefully but still great game and I do personally think it's worth buying.",1

9568,Black Squad,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIn my limited time playing Black Squad, it has a lot of potential to be a great game, so here are a list of good and things they can improvePros- It's not a Pay2Win game. A lot of F2P games allow you to buy better weapons leaving the guys who don't want to spend money at a huge disadvantage. This game is spot on towards competing without disadvantages towards those who don't spend money on ingame items. There are skins and such to buy ingame but does not give advantages to anyone else.- Sounds are really good, the footsteps are loud so sneaking around is usually the best way to goBattle (Gamemode) is a very intense and fun gamemode to play- Most guns are pretty balanced- Demolition (Gamemode) is really fun - It's Free to PlayThings to improve- The Blazer (sniper rifle) is really overpowered in that it's mobility is really high for a one-shot kill. If they reduced movement speed and make it more of a stationary weapon rather than a run and gun one-shot kill then I think that would balance it- When observing (dead/spectating) teammates, it's hard to tell which is a teammate and which is an enemy. I suggest putting a highlight over teammates much like in CSGO so people know who's an enemy and who's not. Also keeping the minimap up while observing would be beneficial for players that use 3rd party communication services (discord, mumble, teamspeak) to help make callouts to teammates - In Demolition (gamemode) Bomb timer is 40 seconds and the defuse is 7 seconds. The maps are fairly large and as a Peacemaker (defender) will take a while to clear areas and get to the bomb to defuse. The percentage of winning a round as a peacemaker, especially when stuck at a disadvantage (1v2) and on the other side of the map, is really low. If they increase the timer to say 50 or 60 seconds it would still be competitive and give the Peacemakers a chance to win the round. Either increase the bomb timer or decrease defusal/plant time.- Would like to see some more gamemodes (maybe Capture the Flag, etc)- Obviously this is still early access but with time I'd like to see more weapons and cooler, more aesthetically pleasing animations when inspecting weapons- Not too big a deal, but adding in-game microphone would be beneficial when playing gamemodes such as demolition where communication is key- Map design is good not great, basic map styles. Some have too many openings it's hard as a Peacemaker to navigate where the enemies are. Keeping it simple will make the game flow much betterOverall this is a fun game that I hope will continue to update and get better.",1
1150,War Thunder,2016.0,"Product received for freeThis is still good simulator game but two years ago was better. Spending money for this game is like buying broken product and manufacturer dont wanna repair this (bugs, crash reports, rng, mm, br) and give you news bells and whistles (new patch, new vehicles(70% premium) but game is still not so good). For free playing is good game however grinding (4/5era) without premium vehicle and account is mission impossible.

19351,Paladins®,,"came to this game from Overwatch, and while I tried to play it before and gave up, it's only been recently that I truly appreciated this game. Overwatch's flaw truly show where this game shines in comparison. This game, while lacking the polish of Overwatch, is vastly more engaging and fun. The world is edgier and has a riskier element to it Blizzard can't pull off. People might say some elements are similar to OW, but I concur. There are so many interesting original champions in this game, that require a lot more skill than those in Overwatch. Each character can be played in multiple ways, and their skill ceilings feel higher. The healers are actually fun to play in this game, with Ying and Mal'Damba being super interesting to play and play against. Overwatch constains you severely on how you can play. You need to play certain heroes properly. They are your tools. In Paladins, champions are your sandbox, and personally I find that a lot more fun.",1
4148,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"The game is pay to win. There is no end game, and only endless chests or hours of mindless grinding will get you real progress. The problem is the loot system which works on a 5 tier system: common, uncommon, rare, epic and golden epic. The loot is progressive so uncommon is a better version of common, rare is a better version of uncommon, and so on. There is no choice of equipment - they simply keep the highest tier available and disenchant the rest.Common, uncommon and rare drop from silver chests, the game's currency which each contain 3 items. VERY rarely a silver chest will be upgraded for free (about one in a hundred?) from a silver chest to a 'Jewelled' chest.These jewelled chests contain 5 items one of which will be rare or above. EPIC gear can only be had from these chests. These chests are sold 3 for $4.99. Buying chests is the difference between 'I might get the achievements this week' and 'See you in 2025'. Chest purchases also grant you a 24 hour 100% damage increase. Cheap, eh?What's worse is the Golden Epics. They come with 'flash sales' which appear periodically to try and pressure you into buying them within a 8-10 hour window. They are ridiculously powerful. Many grant 150% bonuses when common items might be 5%. There are ALOT of these golden epics. You'd have to spend hundreds of dollars just to get those that exist right now, and more to get those they add with each update. Power creep is inherent here - they bring out new characters and gear to outdate the stuff you paid for so you'll buy more stuff. It's a hamster wheel of pay to win crap.What's worse is the dev's have had bugs with the Golden Epic system awarding the wrong things - and refusing to correct all of it even though it's their fault. Even if you give them REAL MONEY for a in-game digital benefit which costs them nothing, they'll still give you the short end of the stick if their crap system glitches.This is nothing but a mobile phone quality java game that rewards continuous spending and excessive playtime over any semblence of logic, skill, or ability. This isn't a game, it's a money pit.",0

At least that's mostly balanced and not totally broken like this.",0
10191,Creativerse,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewSo, while I could not get the full enjoyment out of the game for my multiplayer experience, I will start off by saying this is a wonderfully designed game by appearance. The interface to create and learn recipes is great for single player experiences. Looting and interacting with the world is quite nice. Even the idea of server hosted worlds right out of the box is awesome! But that lead to my major gripe, and what ultimately lead to me ceasing to play the game with my friends. Random world resets, usually via one player crashing, are the biggest annoyance I had. After playing for about a half an hour, we would have established a nice place, storage and what not. Then at least one of us crashed. Those that did, came back to the world to see everything we built and removed from the world restored to how it was when we first found it. They could 'fly' through walls and the floor as if there was no clipping on them, only because in their game, the entire structure didn't exist anymore. If they were to extract the blocks in their way, which were part of the structure in our 'version', they would receive the material as they saw it, but we would see that crafted item be picked up, and effectively deleted due to them getting 'dirt' instead.To alleviate this, those that could see packed up the base and moved to a new location, till the issue repeated. You can only be willing to rebuild/redesign a structure so many times before you just give up. Ultimately, I assume this issue comes from world data being saved on the users pc, and not coinciding/refreshing based on the severs data. At least a debug tool which forces a refresh of currently loaded cells/chunks to be downloaded from the server would be useful until this issue is fixed. But until that time, I will await for updates and play other games. Once again, the game is amazing at what it has so far, but that issue is killer for anyone hoping for a solid multiplayer experience.",1
20294,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2015.0,"I'll admit, I haven't played many MMOs, but LoTRO is one of the best that I've played. You'll enjoy this game somewhat if you're more of a fan of the Peter Jackson movies, but if you're a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic books, like me, you'll go crazy over this game. Another clever thing that Turbine has done is the in-game store. In order to buy things like quest packs, war-horses, and dyes, you use ""Turbine Points"". How do you get Turbine Points? You could buy them...or you could complete deeds like doing so many quests, killing so many orcs/giant fly things/wolves/brigands, or finding different locations in the game world. There is just one big problem this game has: The riding. Not the riding itself, but the riding skill. You need to buy it from the store. And it's not cheap. It's 95 Turbine Points. Considering the most Turbine Points you can get from a deed is 15, and that's for doing over 30 quests, that's quite a lot.In short, if you want a good open-world MMO with a great story, pick this up.PRO TIP: Find and buy a boxed copy of the Mines of Moria expansion pack. You get a extra character per server, VIP for a month, and of course, access to Moria.",1

1218,Magic Duels,2015.0,"Magic duels is a really good card game because it is based on the paper sets which is designed with amazing care and has been improved over the years. It has a decent portion of the paper cards, but only of the newest sets of 2015.The magic rules are well implemented, I did not witness many gameplay bugs.The game is free to play. You begin with tutorials quests for each color, doing a bit of storytelling and explaining how the game works, and giving you the currency of the game as a reward.You are also given the standard starters decks of each color and you can build your deck entirely as you desire between 60 and 100 cards. It has additionnal limitations from the paper game on deckbuilding, the limit of 4 times the same card has been deviated to further reduces the amount of copies of rare cards you are allowed to put in the deck. For example you will be limited to 2 copies of legendary creatures.Winning matches in versus will earn you the game currency against Ai (5-15g) or human (20g) with a limit of 200g per day. Then you can buy boosters for 150g. Boosters will not give you duplicates of a card once you have reached the maximum amount of copies you can fit in a deck. There is no trading cards available. So you will be able to get 6 new cards every day for free as long as you can build a decent deck. You can check magic forums like nogoblinsallowed to get ideas if you are new to this. You will be able to build some solid decks with the basic offered cards.You can also buy the game currency with real money to unlock a lot of boosters immediately.gameplay problematic:The starter decks are extremely limited, you will lose a lot of matchups against human oponents that have farmed the game from the start or that have purchased the booster, wich means that you will need to grind a lot of matches to be able to get to your 150g daily gold to buy a booster, which gets quickly dull. For example the toughest green creature is a vanilla 6/7 for 7 lands, which sucks for a green creature, and especially when a wealthy player will face you with a 6/6, renown 6, for 5 lands, nuke your board with chandra's ignition, and can drop gaia's revenge a bit further down the road.You better play agressive or midrange, because ramp is much better with booster cards.Now the painful part:Magic games have been around for a while, and the matchmaking is still painfull to go through, it is long and buggy. In 2v2 mode you need to reset the match  2/3 because one player was not connected properly and was replaced by AI. That is especially bad compared to the newcommer of the genre Heartstone. And that hurts a lot more when you know that your deck could be much better and you are not that confident in the actual fight that will happen.The passing of turns and interupt mecanisms forced in the game add a lot of downtime compared to paper magic.Don't get me wrong, the game is a lot of fun, you can use it to learn how to play magic and get a good idea how to build decks, staregy and tactics, for free. And you can also play it anytime, anywhere as long as you are connected.But I'd rather recommend playing paper magic with your local community if you live in a city, or buy the boosters ASAP to get you to the fun decks adn spare you the painful grind.  So actually the game is more around 32€ if you want to enjoy it.  ",0

I'm a bit nostalgic about playing the original flash Adventure Quest back when I was like 10 and I guess I should have just left this ""series,"" if you can even call it, in the past as a distant fond memory, distorted by the nostalgia goggles of a 10 year old me that had never actually played many video games (aside from Ape Escape, which actually holds up way better) at that point in my life. About 10 minutes in I had to stop because there is nothing to be found in this game but poorly wasted time. Waste your time on something else. A single looping track that can fit into any fantasy ""rpg"" with the embarassing budget of a public school arts program just repeats again and again. It's painful. I can't fathom anyone spending real world money on the loot boxes and micro transactions (yes! it's one of those games! It's okay to go vomit!)",0
20202,War Thunder,2018.0,"I think this is my most played game on steam currently. This has been one of my favorite games for a very long time. The game is beautiful, the number of planes that are playable is unparalleled, and this is one of the only games of this type with a big enough community to support unique competitive play.That being said, I can no longer support Gaijin or War Thunder with my time or my money. The developers of this game have made abundantly clear that the community has no place in making decisions about the game. The game has on going issues that have been asked time and time again to be fixed to no reply of gaijins. The game has huges issues of balance and BR compression forcing terribly unmatched vehicles against each other. Entire classes of aircraft, namely bombers and attackers, are completely useless in popular Air RB mode again with no solution in sight. Hit boxes on ground targets are broken, bombs have been nerfed into the ground.... the list of flaws with the game goes on many of them having been brought to the developer's attention YEARS ago. YEARS. That is how long we have been waiting on some fixes. The air to air gameplay was engaging enough that much of this was tolerable. However the straw that broke the camel's back is the outright greed of the developers that was put on display on their twitch prime stream. It is abundantly clear the developers only want to milk us for all the cash we're worth with no intention of giving us a fun balanced game that is healthy in the long run. Until this is seriously rectified I am done wasting my time beating my head against the wall and hoping the next update will be the one to set it all straight.I caution new players to consdier this when spending their valuable time or hard earned money with this developer.",0

9291,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game brings me back to the old fishing games I had on my old Windows 98. This game has hours of game time and a good time killer. The baits, the lures are great. The environments, the detail on the fish are pretty good no complaints just wish there were boats.

206,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2018.0,"With all the hours in this game I just can't recommend this. The AI is clunky and the graphics have not kept up with todays. I like how I can go anywhere though, its just these pay walls and endless grinding with all the outdated systems just adds to the frustration. Not to mention the 8 hour download time, if it even works. You just might have to do some of your file digging to fix the installation and its folder, quite annoying. I really used to love this game and am glad its still getting updated, however until something BIG changes, I will have to tell people to steer clear for a whilst. Please overhaul this game.",0

2152,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2017.0,"Raceroom Racing Experience (I will call it R3E for the rest of this review) has come a long way from its beginning days in a good way. Before I talk about the positives of the game, I would like to address some of the negative aspects of the game (remember this is my opinion and yours may differ). CONS:1. The F2P model. The F2P model is more that the game has free base content but you will have to buy the rest of the content unless you are a fast enough racer to consistently win Competitions (more on this later). I have yet to earn vRP (the currency used to purchase content) because I am not fast enough to win Competitions and you earn 0 by actually playing the game whether it is offline or online.2. The ""simulation"". The realism in this game definitely is there (more on this later) but some bugs/design choices make me feel like it isn't a complete sim. Wearing down the tires takes too long even through prolonged abuse and the damage model being too forgiving, are two of the most notable issues I have with the simulation aspect of this game. 3. Online. This game allows people from all over the world to participate in online race events and that is great but it does create laggy races. I personally have joined race servers where even though my ping is 90ms, it feels like my ping is signifacntly higher than that because the cars with lower ping don't look as smooth on the track. Nothing is wrong with those cars but my ping makes other cars look weird which sometimes leads to phantom contact (two carboxes collide even though the car models do not touch).PROS:1. The ""simulation"". The cars handle realistic pattern and some of that I attribute to the real world racers that give feedback to the developers who then turn that feedback to make the cars handle that much better. 2. The sound. The audio in this game is the best out of any racing game that I have ever played. The engine audio sounds great with a great capture of low, mid, and high sounds. Tire sounds give you fantastic audio feedback. My favorite sound is when your car drives into the gravel and you can hear what sounds like small pieces of gravel hitting different parts of the car. It makes the Forza series, which has always been applauded for its audio, look a bit behind. 3. The Competitions. I used to dislike leaderboard hot-lapping but that all changed with this game. Competitions is a game mode where the developers have preset challenges of who can run the fastest time with a certain car and track combo. Some of these ""competitions"" use new cars and tracks (a way to drive new cars and tracks without owning the content) and challenges the community to see who can adapt and be the quickest. Some of the other ""competitions"" are sponsored by actual companies and over a several week competition that also goes to different tracks every week, the winner gets a prize. For example, there is currently a WTCC competition, where the top 30 or so drivers at the end of the competition compete in a final race. The prizes include cash and tickets to WTCC race(s). 4. The AI. After an update to the AI (a couple of months back from the time of this review), the offline experience got a signifcant increase. The AI are aggressive, use slightly different lines, and have a much larger difficulty adjustment for players of most skill levels being able to enjoy a nice race against computers. It reminds me of rFactor 2 AI which is another racing game with fantastic AI (probably the best but that is for another review).I would definitely recommened this game because the pros outweigh the cons, in my opinion.",1
19591,Creativerse,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI only played on it's free week, But it was AWESOME. And that says a lot because i personally don't like Minecraft. At All.So, All in All you should definitely get this game.",1

18515,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEach patch makes the game slightly worse - to the point where they have characters that get ban in 90% of competetive matchs that haven't recieved a nerf since their release. They don't really seem to give a crap about their community either since they're releasing a new pay-to-win system into their game which is being recieved with major disapproval from the community, yet they're going through with it anyway.I've put money into this game and regret it, I would not recommend anyone do the same.Edit: The launch of their pay-to-win system is the single worst experience in gaming I think I have ever had.",0
2285,Star Trek Online,2015.0,"Just don't.

11983,theHunter Classic,2014.0,"It's my first hunting simulation, I really enjoy it and there are a lot of things you can learn from its wiki wich lead you, for example, to a real scoring for mule deers or any other information you didn't know about some species. It is very interesting for those who love hunting simulations. It's realistic, the environment you are in is important in relation to the animal you are hunting and if you miss a move, they're gone but you still can find them later with the track they leave behind. Also, there are a lot of places to go and the maps are big enough to trip trough forests and water.Why don't I recommend this game?Because if you want a good equipment, you need to spend a lot of real money or spend some time on third-party pages (eather you earn a little or not... yes, some links does not simply reward you). Well, you earn some virtual cash when you finish a mission but, you can not even buy a thing that is worth your work and time in-game. I don't even know how dare they call this game a F2P. When you are a beginner and don't want to give a few bucks, the only thing that can be done is tracking or kill one of the 18 species (you must have licenses for them ->money) with a single default rifle and there are a lot of missions to do but you can't complete them because you don't really want to spend your own money on that...Again, it's a very interesting game but the store and monetary system in-game made me sick...",0
364,DCS World Steam Edition,2016.0,+R.I.P+ At this price id prefer P3D x-plane and other stuff. DCS is a long time fly-for-nothing-simulator. Almoust empty servers.

466,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFractured Space, a 5 V 5 Moba, with capital ships, in space.I like this game, a lot. A diverse range of flashy capital ships blowing each other up in a ballestic display of fireworks and strategy.The core gameplay consists of you controlling a single capital ship, assaulting the enemy's base while defending your own, resulting in fierce smaller tactical battles in separate sectors of space that your ship can warp to, while the greater strategy of getting sufficient resources (gained by holding control points) and picking up the gamma bonus (capturing a point in a central sector that gets you a large temporary bonus).Overall, there's a fair amount of depth to this game, and it's a lot of fun. Would recommend to anyone fond of space opera type battles, or want to pilot with the big boys.",1

Please make it the way it was before, I don\'t want to see this game crash and burn. There are so many pros to this game, but that one MASSIVE con is outweighing them all. I beg you, please go back to the way of earning cash that WORKED, which was the better you play, the more cash you get.

9478,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,"TF2 is a casual free to play first person shooter. On its own, that doesn't really translate to much, but with a wide variety of game modes, incredibly high skill-cap, and diverse classes with a variety of weapons to cater to a large amount of playstyles, TF2 does stand out as being a cut above the rest.  Balancing unfortunately, isn't as strong as it could be and there are a few legitimately overpowered weapons, and not all classes are equal in usefulness. However, with the lack of cash shop based game stats, and the default weapons generally being the most versatile and reliable in the game, on top of the skill-caps of the classes; Keeping in mind the casual nature of the game, any issue with balance is minor enough that it can be worked around through player skill and team-coordination. Their business model only requires a single item to be purchased from the in-game store--or to be gifted a premium upgrade package--at which point, any cosmetic weapon, or upgrade can be found through playing the game, crafted, or purchased through in-game resources. It's a very fair game, with one of the best free to play models in the market.The primary difficulty you'll find with the game is starting it. With a lackluster tutorial, un-cordinated public games, and little assistance in the relatively deep tactics and game mechanics for the various classes, it can be hard to become skilled enough to coordinate in solo-play. Playing with friends, and doing some research into the game is highly recommended, as TF2 won't do it for you.TF2, on it's own is highly mod-friendly, and has a variety of community made servers running custom game modes. With a bit of searching, you can find hangouts, mini-games, training servers, custom maps, unofficial weapons, and the like. On top of the official game, and fairly friendly community, it's not especially difficult to get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the game without any issues, or requirements to invest money.  It has its problems, but ultimately they are minor. What TF2 offers is a rich FPS experience, with enough community support to satisfy a variety of tastes. So I have no issues recommending this game to any FPS fan looking for a team-focused, objective based shooter.",1

19699,Dota 2,2015.0,"I've been playing Dota 2 since December 2011 and i really like most of the aspects of this game. Dota 2 is great for players who aim for competetive gaming but is equally good for casual gamers who play for the sole purpose of enjoyment. One of the features of dota 2 which i like the most is its ever-evolving ""Meta"" gameplay which changes from time to time. Just when u think you've figured out the meta, a new patch arrives and with it comes new sections to explore,learn and adapt to the changes. This changing metagame not only manages to keep the casual gamers entertained but also tends to reset the Professional Scene. A champion team who dominated the most of the tournaments on the previous patch may be quickly replaced by another team who adapted to the new changes of the recently released patch way faster as compared to the rest of the teams. The beauty of the game lies in its ever evolving nature. The more u learn about it, the more u fall in love with it. Recommended for all gamers who have a thing for strategy games or want to try out Dota 2 beacuse of its huge community.",1

Duel Links,2017.0,"I've played Duel Links for over 130~ hours now, there's a few negatives and positives to the game itself, i think after looking it all over, i'm still going to give it a positive review, just due to the fact it may not be perfect, but it's the best Yu-Gi-Oh game on the market, and it's been fun playing for 130+ hours regardless of its flaws.Positives-When i first started out the game was very generious with gifting ""Gems"" (What you need to purchase card packs)I received almost 2500 gems upon starting out, enough to open over 50 packs-thousands of ways to make your deck personal-Lower tier PvP was really fun ( more on that in negatives )Negatives-Once i got around 110~ hours into the game, i hit a wall, it's become near impossible to obtain Gems easily. Every 8~ hours or so i can only obtain 50-100 gems, enough to only open 1-2 card packs (If you're trying to find that deck you want it's almost impossible at this pace)-Again, after that 110~ hour mark it becomes apparent you need to spend money to keep going in the game competitively speaking-When you're in the higher rankings for PvP you'll have the same deck played against you every game, people use the best meta deck available instead of being creative, you'll have to face the infamous ""Cyber Angel"" deck which is near impossible to beat.The PvP becomes very boring due to the lack of diversity in this stage.-When also PvPing you'll be going against players from around the world, this also causes some major issues with the lag, your connection will wave in-and-out causing matches to last way longer than normal",1

They have made a step in the right direction by somewhat making the shotgun better, but dont get excited. There is a reason that almost all of the big time streamers left and when to play PUBG, H1Z1 isnt even on the top 10 front page of twitch.

The thing i hate the most is that almost every enemy has some sort of stun and almost every class has a stun or something similar of that type.  Even though i put the music in the pros, it can get annoying to listen to the same music over and over again so it's better if you just put up you own music after listening to the bgms a few times. About what i mentioned earlier about some items can't be obtain easily with the in-game cash you earn through missions and dungeons. I'm talking about costumes, fortification scrolls and refining materials if you're in a rush to get the strongest weapons. You have to do dungeons everytime when you have the entry points to go. The game also has a lot of pop culture references in the game so take note of that :",1

5144,War Thunder,2014.0,"=Old Review, 2014=  Great primarily WWII era military game. with Aviation, ground units, and eventually naval units as well. Overall fun to play.=New Review, 2016=  All I play at this game's current state is Jets.  Not because jets are better, or more balanced.  That's a total joke.  I can't really think of any plane or tank that has its real life performance accurately portrayed in the game.  Then again, I only play jets.   Jets as in a general term.  I own pretty much the entire US and German air tree, some Russian, and British jets as well.  So I fly F-86/CL-13 Sabres.  Which, are underperforming in regards to their flight models.  Germany also has a GDR MiG-15bis, that does not perform as well as its Russian tree counterpart, the MiG-15bis.  Some could argue that it's Russian bias in a way, as nearly every game I play, Allied pilots scream about MiGs being a 'point and click adventure' and being overpowered.  This is also not true.  Recently the N-37, the 37mm cannon that the MiGs carry ingame, recieved a nerf.  They 'spark' on almost every shot, and fire at a lower velocity compared to its, still relatively slow, previous version.  Getting kills with MiGs actually takes some skill to use, and if the children that only fly F-86 played with MiGs, they'd cry that Sabres are overpowered.   Nothing in this game is truly balanced, and there's doubt that it ever will be.  I have been around since 2013, and logged about a total of 4000 hours ingame (played it before it was on steam), and every plane and tank has seen changes over the years. And will continue seeing changes.  Yes, there is a real Russian bias.  You can see this on the forums if you dare to go there, or just ask any player.  But even Russian vehicles aren't IMMEDIATELY overpowered, just because they are Russian.(well, maybe in tanks. Russians club anything atm that isnt British, but that's just because as of this post, British tanks are still in CBT, so the only people playing them PAYED to play them, including myself)I still recommend this game, because it can still be enjoyable, if you overlook all the broken aspects.  But flying props is cancer, and jets are completely broken.Here's to hoping 2016 will help fix many aspects of this once glorious game",1

19898,Champions Online,2015.0,"So, throughout my years (yes years, I had this game with a different account) playing this, I've picked up a lot of good things and a lot of bad things. I'll tell them both and let you decide whether or not you want to play this game. For starters, the pros. -There is a huge community that's kind enough to answer a question you may have or if you just want to make sure. -There's a wide scale of things to do, whether it's leveling your created character or roleplaying with all types of other characters. -The game is pretty big when it comes to customization, you can basically make whatever you want, however you want. -The players who play this are awesome roleplayers, and are great at teaching most how to roleplay or to play in general (Kind of linking to the good community)-Rewards that make you feel like you earn something when you level up, like a great powerful attack or an aura that helps with bleed effect. Now here are some of the cons. -microtransactions, because almost every mmo has them. -Combat is lacking, almost making you snore when fighting this awesome badass alien bug. -Trolls, because every game has them period. -A small percentage (I'm talking like .02%) of the community are just douches to you no matter the reason (linking with the trolls) So really, when it comes down to it, it's a great roleplaying game but it lacks the combat system that games today have, like in the newer Grand Theft Autos or The Elder Scrolls Online, so there are a few give-and-take situations with this. I recommend this game if: -You are an avid roleplayer. -You have a creative imagination when it comes to original characters. -You have patience with few others. -You're into comic-style graphics that look pretty. I DON'T recommend this game if: -You're in it for the combat. -You don't have a sense of creativity. -You have very little patience with anything. -You absolutely HATE microtransactions. There's my thoughts on the game, feel free to let me know if I missed any pros and cons, and try the game out for yourself if you think you're interested.",1

The F2P is wonderfully designed and works out perfect: Like tf2, Planetside2  has free2play aspects in it. You can play and earn any gun in game, albeit it'll take you a long time. The only thing that you cannot earn in game are cosmetic items(Helmets, decals, things of that nature.) If your a newcomer, give this game try: however, i would join a outfit, as soloing is harsh and boring at times. Also, it helps to have a fairly powerful PC.

1435,Fractured Space,2018.0,"so... I see that the developer is updating the game and upgrading it and what not..... BUTI started playing this game 2-3 years ago and ok, I was new and in development. Then devise optimized it and added ""for laptops"" feature, basically scaling everything down so it's less hardware heaviest. But at the time game wasn't that balanced so I left my second visit after a year. This is my 3rd visit and I see that game progressed a lot. New menu UI and a lot of graphics elements added. That being said, its more hardware heavy now... AGAIN. All of that would be OK if I had graphics options that would render my game playable. I forgot to mention that I'm playing on IntelHD 5500 integrated gpu. So... I would recommend adding more options to ingame UI, and graphics alike and solve problems that game has:-ton of (motion)blur (I dont even have an option to add/remove this♥♥♥♥♥♥ its just eating my gpu power and its just blocking my vision)-camera angle (I wonder if devs had this in mind; just like in TestDriveUnlimited I would like to adjust how high or low would I like my ship to be on my screen, I have found myself trying to scroll my wheel to zoom out as much as I can just to get that little extra clear vision on whats around me, Its difficult to see when my ship is half of my screen)-locked camera zoom value (I dont want it to reset every time I die)-greater zoom out value (just like camera angle, a little bit more options cant hurt)-FOV (this all depends on personal preference, I like it high and some people like it ""normal"")-corrected graphics option values (whats ""low"" to these devs is ""high"" in normal games, when it comes to weaker hardware, of course I want to make it playable)-optimized laptop mode (I guess that goes with correcting gfx options but now I dont have a feeling that this option works since the game looks better with laptop mode ON now then it used to look with laptop mode OFF a year ago)I bet all of this can be corrected in 2 days with few simple lines of code, Im not asking for quantum tech coding here.

There used to be different progression systems and matches where medics were your only source of healing. I myself loved being a medic but after recent updates where after 10 seconds you regenerate, I've been rendered mostly useless as most players run off and don't stick with a medic.I spent so much time grinding to buy higher tier cubes and then comes an update where cubes have no tier, and thus all of my hard work is for nothing.

13825,Brawlhalla,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is smash bros., but it's not... First of it's many differences from smash bros, is that your ""Legend"" only starts with unarmed attacks. These are weak but can be very fast attacks. ( good for rabbit punches, almost litterally )Then you see a generic icon that looks like a flaming sword stuck in the ground. This is a random weapon pick-up spot. If  you grab this you will get one of your Legend's weapons, which include, spears, guns, dual daggers, hammers, rocket lances, and swords. These do more damage than your  unarmed attacks.  Some attack faster and more powerful than others. Now here is the equivalent of a ""Special"". Every character has 2 special attacks, 1 with each weapon respectively. Some are ranged and some are close range. The graphics are kind of cartoony, and are really fun! (you can tell the devs had fun making this game) There are also bombs, 1 kind that explodes on contact, 1 that is kind of like a sticky bomb that will explode when touched, or after a certain time limit. There is also a horn that summons your mechatronic valkerie, which flies in with a weapon, and on fire hitting your enemies. The music is fitting for the arenas and not bad.And when you win ( or lose ) There is a chat box, in which you can say ""GG"" or ""HACKER!!!"" or ""LAAAAAG"", pretty much whatever you want... people just log out anyhow... :[ It's still a good feature!All in all I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE <3 <3 <3 <3 THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Just apply for the beta, just DO IT!

12814,Fractured Space,2018.0,"This is a great arena style game. The visuals are awesome and the gameplay is even better. There are enough abilities on the different ships to all make the unique, but no so many that a player feels overwhelmed with options such as in league of legends (this is my opinion, I could never get into LOL due to this, other opinons may very). The gamepley is well paced and the progression of levels whilst in game (not out of game rank) is steady enough so that the game isn't instantly over, but also not so long that the game drags out for ages. The release of the new ""story"" missions that come out with every new patch is a bit of a double edged sword; the new game modes are fantastic and bring a new way to play the game, into the game. However, I think that because so many people are playing this game mode (because it's very good) there aren't many people waiting to play regular PVP, with me waiting up to 45 minutes before being able to paly a game. On the whole, I really like this game and would deffinitely recomend this to anyone who likes the idea of the whole ""arena"" combat style of game, but is intimidated by games such as LOL or Dota 2. Furthermore it also suits the casual gamer, being simle enough for people to be able to pick the game up and just play, whilst also being complex enough for competative gamers to be able to have fun too.",1
3617,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAt it's current state I wouldn't recommend this game for anyone but Free-to-play players with a lot of free time.  If you're a paying customer the Legendary cards which you can have 4 of in a deck is difficult to collect.  Especially with less free time to play.  They tout guaranteed 3 legendaries for every ""box = 32 packs"" which is normally all you're going to get.  It's ridiculous in a game where you need 4 of said legendaries.  I've purchased quite a few boxes and rarely have I ever got anything more than that.  Unless you're fine just playing one deck for a long time it's an awful system.Also, this game is similar to Magic The Gathering in it's mana/lands for resource.  Which doesn't really translate well in a online card game.  When I can go 5 games in a row being mana starved playing 25 power in a deck plus 4 x of Seek Power spell that lets me find one is equally ridiculous.  I've played Magic for 20+ years and never had an issue like that in the physical game.  Hell, not even in the online version.",0

1467,Minion Masters,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewA pretty interesting game at first, but it really isn't a unique concept. What makes this game not worth getting, however, is the look of this meant to be an F2P. I don't like the fact that you pay for a game, and then there are microtransactions, similar to how EA messed up their Battlefront 2, and I'm pretty sure you (the reader of this review) wouldn't either. Other then that, I can't really come up with a detailed review of this game, so I'll just give a list of Pros and Cons.Pros:(-) Unique minion system where its a deck full of minions instead of a bit of a more limited system like some battling tower defense battling gamesCons: (-) Micro Transactions(-) Can get boring pretty fast(-) Plays more like an F2P game instead of 5$ game",0

Currently at lv16 and have the basic Guardian package (one-time payment - not required!). Update 1: Almost level 20 (current max level).

Looking at the ""game plan"" I'm 50/50 on some of the features like ""Dragon Crystals from watching ads"" - [AQ3D Website] AQ3D Game-Plan. Which is a hard pass, but I'll grit my teeth if limited only to mobile and tablet - so no pc!.-->THE EDITS<-- | Edit 1: Missed spelling and grammar corrections. Credit to Grammarly also (what I used before posting). If I get names or anything wrong please forgive me. Edit 2: Made the 0s in Dragon Lord5151's [space between Dragon and Lord] name the actual numbers (requested). Edit 3: Removed a space (should be last edit, sorry).______________________________________________________________________________Overview:The game itself is a grind, not so much like MapleStory (2D free to play sidescroller), but you do notice it. Most of the game, as far as I can see (for now), can be played without spending a penny. Gear can be bought with gold or grinded for. Some gear can only be grinded for and cannot be bought with gold or dragon coins (real money). When crafting gear you can either wait the allotted time or speed it up with dragon coins; Similar to crafting systems in games like Warframe. However, this is never needed and if you have the patience can by waiting - doing other things like grinding levels, resources etc. Story:The story is minimal and kinda lacklustre but it is there. There is no voice acting but the music isn't half bad. It doesn't really pick up until after Doomwood; Which is the DragonSlayer questline in Ashfall. It may be because I am a higher level, or that it's faster paced, or a combination of it all. But that's how it feels for me right now.Optimisation:I run on a crappy laptop and for the most part, the game is easy running. Which is always a plus for me. It's no eye candy (thank the heavens), but it isn't half bad. I was born in the '90s though.Side Notes:There is no mini-map or world map in the game. The abilities are really simple, others suggesting a skill tree (even a simple one would do). Most paid items are cosmetic it seems, but alternative potions to the gold bought varients are paid (including some paid only potions) like XP and faster gold potions. Also - yes, I have bought roughly two so far. Why, because XP is so minimal in this game. I know the cap is 20 (with 100 being the max allegedly). But please, make it a little more than what it is. Although, can't really complain as I don't mind in the grand scheme of things.Notes on Story:Apart from it needing a hell of a lot more content and features. The story needing additions like voice acting, choices and cinematic cutscenes maybe.Final Say:There is a whole lot more I could say, but check discussions; As lots of people have talked about and suggested much more than what I have here. Credit to all the ones I read, and to Dragon Lord5151. If you can put up with the minimal gameplay and story (which for now I hope is only due to early access). Then I recommend this game. Or, wait for full release. Also, PLEASE ONLY HAVE MICROTRANSACTIONS COSMETIC ONLY. Because, the day that this becomes P2W (Pay-to-Win) - I will quit this game. Regardless of my time invested. Credit and Extra:Take care everyone, and I hope this helped. Again, credit to everyone in the game who has mentioned stuff, people in the discussions thread (on steam) and DragonLord5151.",1
233,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2014.0,Garbage... rather expensive garbage for what could be a great game if it ever got finished.The graphics do seem dated but for a game that seems geared to be a simulator if runs great.You only truly get one option to realy play and that feels like a techdemo at best.I used a MS Xbox stering wheel on this and found the options were good for fixing most of the sensitivity issues however the peddels were way to sensitive and I could not fix that ingame.I found the game whould freak out with the accelarator (due to sensitivity I asume) and make me veer right and ither hit a wall or make me invalidate my lap and with that the lap invalidation (track box) is way to sensitive in places.If you like me were or are looking for a game to TEST a steering wheel then by all means try this but you will need to register an email account to the game.,0

And when you join a full game, occasionally you aren't able to leave, practically forcing you to play a game you don't want to take part in.b) The game needs a chat function, emojis aren't enough, especially when a player is taking forever to rollc) The bots.

2486,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewHello Players!I might be a bit biased in this review and no offence to the developers, but the game sucks. I could have given it a positive review a year ago, before the update. Before it was clear (Tiers). People played with people who are the same Tier as them, and the game was more or less balanced. I mean there was at least some balance. Of course there were some super donors who actually bought good stuff and played with you. Even if they killed you, that was fair enough. You cold just face it. And you could see by their blocks, colours and stuff how good they are and whether to evade them or fight them. The update messed up the game. Now, textures were removed, colours for each Tier block where removed and what? Yo can colour your Mark 10 (Tier 10) blocks white and everybody will attack you. And you just rek them. Also before GC (Galaxy Cash) had a higher value. You could buy a Megabot for like 5 dollars GC or could build a boog T7 for 10 euros. Like super mega Tier 7 or prebuilt magabot. Now, the cheapest crappest robot costs 30 euros, like a Call Of Duty or GTA V game. Tier system was messed up. Now worst players play with best players. Da hell?

6215,Dungeon Defenders II,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewA sequel to the wildly popular and unique Dungeon Defenders game that takes a different direction from its predecessor.(Note, I originally did not recomment this game, but after hours of playing, I have decided to recommend it.  I'll explain why below.)Pros- Personal loot drops make for a more relaxed game where you don't have to constantly keep your eyes out for drops you need (There's no more race to grab the good loot before other players and that is a great design call)- The classes have some really cool attacks and abilities making each feel unique- Changes to mana and loot selling have made things much easier, both for sorting through loot and for upgrading it- Seperation of mana for building and for personal powers was a great call- Easy group finding system gets you right into the action- Reputation system makes random players more inclined to be polite- Synergy system means you can make powerful tower combinations if you have a cooperative team of players.Cons- Can't play offline- Long lags between games.  Due to the fact that a game has no clear leader, everyone has to ready up for the game to progress between levels and after the games.  This doesn't sound too bad, but when people go afk or someone new isn't paying attention, it can end up being 2+ minutes to continue on- Solo, each classes tower set is lacking (I'll explain more about this below)- A lack of mana will prevent you from doing much during a combat round (at least at low level)- The win points and fun-factor strategies to this game aren't as obvious as they were in the original- Builder specs feel very nerfed thanks to the lack of mana (EDIT: Again, this is only when you don't try to work with the other player's towers)- Maps are a bit bland, there aren't as many strategic points where you can put towers to have them cover multiple lanes- Tower synergies are esential to effective play- Certain specs are almost completely useless right now- Gating low-level players means that you can't power level your buddies.  It also means that, if your buddies get too far ahead, you can't play with them unless you make a new character.- Certain monsters outrange your towers.  I'm not sure if this changes at high level, but at low level it's extremely frustrating.  It means that you'll be babysitting your towers instead of being able to place them in different spots and trust them to do their job.- Due to the fact that you have to babysit your tower clumps, you cannot solo most of the levels (At least as an apprentice)So I went back and started playing as the monk with a friend who was playing the huntress, and I quickly figured out a pretty devistating combo that made the game much more playable.  I also figured out that one of my mages towers, while not super impressive when combined with his original towers, was extremely effective when combined with one of the monk's auras.So it seems the devs are really pushing for cooperative gameplay in this one, the game almost feels more like WoW than it does Dungeon Defenders.  To be successful, each player must assume a certain role in their tower construction.  A group of apprentice towers isn't very effective, however an ice tower combined with an electric aura (monk) combined with a water geyser (hunter) is devastating.  The concept is fun when it works out, the big problem is that new players or stubborn players will often build whatever they want, effectively lowering your chances of success.  I feel like this sort of design choice needs to be combined with a matchmaking system that tries to put one of each class in a game together.  (Maybe this is already the design, I don't know, but I was often in games with several members of my own class.)The good news is, I did start having a lot of fun once I figured out how the devs expected me to play.  However, I had to do a lot of digging to find that answer.  The game needs to guide its new players better so they know what's needed for victory and don't just build whatever, therebye frustrating the other people who are trying to work as a team.Also, the game needs more towers and more tower synergies.  As of this review, there is one devastating tower/aura/trap combination and everything else is very meh.  Certain towers are very meh and pretty much un-needed.  This needs to be changed so that there are multiple metas (tower building combinations) showing up in the games instead of just 1 or 2.In closing, the game is fun but very different from the first Dungeon Defenders.  You'll have the most fun when playing with friends, and you may want to watch some videos on how to effectively use your towers depending on your class.* UpdateSo the game changes quite a bit at high level.  Once you get your gear established and start the process of farming, you pretty much only need one skilled builder (generally an apprentice or squire) to do the tower setup for the level.  To be honest, it is kind of grindy and not always fun.  And while finding new items to improve your stats can be fun, the actual gameplay isn't.  This may change once more maps are available and harder difficulties are provided.  I'm going to keep my recommendation for now as the game isn't bad and still has potential, but I'm really looking for some new kinds of juicy cooperative gameplay.",1

Okay now you won a weapon with some value YAY you are never going to sell because the colors are pretty. So in result you're just an idiot spending money on colors for a gun. You are too special for the regular skins?----Competitive:          All you will expirence is rage towards your teammates because they don't do the thing you expect them to do. Or people will insult you with a mic because you're a noob even if it's round 1 and no shooing began. Or you can compare with your friend your rank saying hey I am in AK Gold I don't have any skills I just play a lot and insult people.----Game itself:         If you play none Competitive mod all you will find is either the casual mod which is good but filled with players who filled with rage because they are disapointed of their ranks on Competitive so you will end up leaving. The only good part of Counter Strike Globale Offensive is the mods like Jailbreak, deathrun, surf. But most people don't play on it because they play those awesome mods on CSS the real thing.----Opinion:Great game, but sadly money and popularity caught up. And now people don't play the game like they use to. It's all about competitive and weapon skins which is depressing. And now I saw they added a kill cam? I am sorry to say but this game died 1 year ago. If you're interested to play competitive and spend all you money on useless skins be my guest.Even if playing Competitive is all about raging towards your teammates or simple rage because you think your good but you're not. If you got taste in video game, then buy counter strike source. I am sorry but if this is a good game for you, you are not better than League of Legends players and not gamers.FYI there is no true challenge raising in ranks in CS:GO it's all about playing a lot no skills is needed. Counter strike Source is what i recomand no this. This is just a shadow of Counter Strike Source.",0

9500,SMITE®,2016.0,"I have spent a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of time playing this game and all I have to say is I have never been so horribly disappointed by any game i have ever played in my entire â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing life. Like most MOBA's. It started out great! The game was fun and fairly well balanced and the community was actually significantly better than the notoriously toxic community's of other MOBA's such as League of Legends. But just like every other game of it's type, it went to absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing horsecockery. First and foremost, the company isâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ They don't listen to the community. They get countless complaints all over about different things that are not working as intended or not working at all, severely overpowered gods, and game breaking bugs, but instead of fixing or even acknowledging those problems, they tweak a few minor details once every thousand years that make little to no difference, and are typically things that no one wants or gives aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥about. The gods are so horribly unbalanced, and the less skill it takes to play your character the higher your chances of winning. (This if â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fact. Loki, Poseidon and Odin are prime examples) Out of the vast supply of existing gods currently in the game i'd say there are maybe 20 that people actually play. There are far too many instances of gods that are just plain better than others. And I don't mean counters. I mean that there are about 5 mages that are 4000x stronger than all of the other mages. And this goes for every single class. Not to mention every time they release a god they overpower the livingâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥out of it in hopes to get more people to spend money on them. I really did love this game when i first started playing it and would easily say that at it's peak, it was the best MOBA i ever played. But just like other MOBA's i have watched it slowly decay into the bubblingâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥volcano that stands before me today. I could spend so much longer talking about everything that myself and many others find wrong with this game at this point in time but I realized that i've already wasted too much. So if you wanna know more reasons why you shouldn't download this taco-bell-shotgun-diahhrea game, feel free to contact me and I can give you more reasons than you could ever possibly need. If I had to thoroughly sum this game up in a sentence, i would call it nothing but a gargantuan â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time vampire.0/100000000 would not reccomend to the dark lord himself",0
13466,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2015.0,"Pretty nice graphics, don't mind the microtransactions but I refuse to spend money until they fix the AI.

9392,SMITE®,2016.0,"CASUAL GAMERS LISTEN UP! You can come play this, I promiseNow, why do I start that way?

You can still be GOOD and have FUN without being super competitive. This community isn't very toxic. Especially compared to other MOBAs. You have 74 unique Gods an Goddesses to choose from. It isn't THAT hard to get into. It's a bit confusing AT FIRST, but you pick up on things quickly. Lots of videos on youtube you can look up and see whatever it is you don't know.I DEFINITELY say try this, even if you have had bad experiences with MOBAs or have never played one; this game will be a good experience regardless.

19864,Magic Duels,2017.0,"This is a game that had been promised to have most of the features (if not all) from magic online and will receive constant update from Wizard team. Unfortunately, it is now abandoned by Wizard themselves. They are working on make a new title called magic arena which is basically a mimic version of hearthstone/shadowverse with almost identical interface(at least at its current stage) except for having gameplay rules from MTG. I will not expect anything from that honestly. If u are looking for a game with interface like Magic Duel and still have cards from the most recent sets and upcoming sets, u should take a look on this mod community forum for MTG DotP 2014 (link: https://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=109&sid=4cc9d2c13421361cd0eaa4e2b269b15f )Being a MTG DotP player since 2012 version, i have played over 800 hours DotP serise before this one. However, I only play this game for a tiny bit of time because from the moment I see this game is going to be a time consuming based grinding experience, I lost most of my interest to it (not to mention the annoying ""teach me trainning drone"" minor battle scenes keep popping up multiple times in one single campaign mission :X) Overall I still would give this game a 6/10 score because it at least is a free-to-play game good for MTG learners and has enough cards that u can grind to unlock and then to create some interesting decks to play with.",1

Super fun game though!",1
20066,Minion Masters,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewCurrently has a lot of pay2win (P2W) going.Or lets say its the other way around.You only get cards by opening packs (one random card per pack).Since the packs only hand a rando mcard, you can end up having an account where you get unlucky and unlock stuff you dont need, while all the other players are lucky and get stuff thats suited for the current meta.For example the Anti-Spell Dragon that is widely used because it damages you when you use a spell.I never got that Dragon, although i opened over 130 packs already. and there arent that many cards available at all.And the same goes for several other really useful cards that you NEED to build a proper deck and try different tactics.For example a tactic to send a healer after a tank (which needs you to have the Priestess Card), but you cant do such a tactic without having the cards you need for that.Which means that unless you pay loads of money, you are crippled in your ability to create proper decks, try different tactcis and so limits your freedom.Which would be fine if you could just create a good deck with dumb common stuff.Which you can, but you wont get through the meta that needs you to have at least a few of the legendary cards in the game.Well it can turn out fine.Sadly i am in a spot, where i lack pretty much any of the legendaries you need to get higher in rank, which is frustrating.I also dont have the cards i need to try out fun tactics.Instead the packs i open give me doubles.Oh but you might say ""cant you use the ones you have too often and create a specific card you need?""Well technicly yes. But, a legendary card costs 2000 shards. To get the legendaries i really need to at least be able to do some new (and fun) stuff i would need to have about 8000 shards.Scrapping a legendary gives you about 50 shards.Which means you have to grind packs forever to get enough shards to craft specific rare cards.And obviously you get more of the common stuff to scrap and not legendaries (otherwise i wouldnt have the problem in the first place).Which are at around 15 shards per scrapped card.Fun situation to prove thats a problem:When you get matchmaked in a 2v2 (my team both level 30 and 36) against a level 248 and a level 3, but level 3 somehow has a pure legendary and rare cards deck with all the good stuff.Smurfing and P2W for real (you reach level 3 already with just doing the tutorial).At this point it gets frustrating NOT because other players paid money to be better than you and stronger, but because you have to spend money or otherwise you cant properly choose the cards you need and build a deck.In short, the game is ""pay money for freedom"".Which ultimatively ends up being P2W anyway.At this point  ican only say that the system isnt fun or good.And the monetization could be fairer for all.Make champions paid, make cosmetics paid, make cards unlockable with gold (easy to farm) and allow the player to pick which card he/she wants to buy.Maybe even have the game offer a singleplayer mode (like the expedition and challenges) where you can gather each card that exists once.I personally would buy the new champions, but i wont buy packs and pay into a gambling machine. In the end i would pay 30€ just to get the same legendaries again and obviously all the commons i already own.Wouldnt do that ever. Which means in return, i will also NOT buy a new champion. So they lost me twice with that system.Even if all of the above doesnt apply, its still ""pay money to get a random card in a slot machine (its roulette here)"", which im not up to.And that means, Minion Masters is like all the Mobile Games that are free to play or all these CCG Games on Steam that are free to play. Which is sad as the game itself is actually great to play and fun. Its deep and offers enough freedom to create unique tactics (if you manage to be lucky and get the cards you want/need).As it is though, even with being a good game per se, the macrotransaction gamble system kills it and so it is like all (most of ) the other free to play stuff.A P2W slotmachine.",0

I am a fan of Magic The Gathering and I really dont like how you play Legends or Hearthstone. Even Yu-Gi-Oh is more fun to play as the the genearl gameplay is more fun for me.

Dies again with two wards...""SHOULD HAVE CALLED MISSING WTF"" - Jackass who dove towers and lost a 1v1""Insert Racist Comments"" - Raging Idiot Bat Signal""1 v 1 me mid"" - This guys inferiority complex is meme levels""SaD yOu dIdNt LEaRn aNytHing fRoM pLaYing"" - Actual idiot, implying you learn from games? wtf lol dude? This is why drugs are for losers.Pro Tip #2: A particularly good way to deal with ragers is when they inevitably feed, just type ""lol"" it sparks tremendous reactions between these fumbling jackasses. Sometimes it is better to humble them so they dont make themselves look dumb as hell the next time they decide to say stupid things.Sometimes its better to let them ride it out because they simply cannot help themselves. I found out from my friends they will frequently move onto another subject matter when they realize senpai is not noticing them :(Pro Tip #3: Have fun, dont let these raging morons ruin the game for you like they did me. If you follow Pro Tips 1 & 2, the reactions to the ragers is priceless, it demolishes their spirit and will think twice about their redherring tactics and actually l2p and git gud.Extra: Had one guy messaging me for several weeks and creating different accounts in order to throw racial slurs. He checked my profile, saw I had a Spanish flag, you can pretty much guess his favorite word.",0
17467,H1Z1,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's pretty bad at current state, Daybreak seems only interested in adding more MTX to milk money and hasn't had a roadmap or any blogs to discuss future updates for months now not mention lack of updates that actually improve anything, latest update broke shotguns and vehicles for example.

3362,War Thunder,2018.0,"I'll start with the good things: graphics and visuals are great, shell ballistics are too.Now to the bad things: close air support like P-47s, AD-2s and 4s are absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing aids and are unreasonably overpowered. Matchmaking is not historic at all and nor is it balanced in any way shape or form, you either get steamrolled or you steamroll the enemy team with completely unbalanced and awful battle ratings. German late WW2 tanks also basically always fight cold war era tanks too. Premium tanks and planes are pretty much pay to win, and especially the american T28 which is invincible from the front to any gun at its BR. Event vehicles are extremely hard to get and even then you need to have no social life at all to get them, and since Gaijin market has been rolled out Gaijin basically forces you to buy whatever it is you need to get the event vehicle if it requires parts. Also Gaijin doesn't seem to listen to its community whatsoever and only prioretises whatever gets them paid and only fix bugs whenever they want and not when it's a massive issue.I could keep going with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t that War Thunder has been doing for a very, very long time but i hope this is enough to turn off any potential player from this atrocious game, if this game ever gets fixed (which i doubt it will) i'll revise my review and maybe actually recommend it to people.3/10",0

It does not have decent graphics and weapon recoils are pretty much non-existence, but jumping into the game and messing up with enemies did bring me a lot of joy. This is a F2P game so do not expect it has AAA title's quality. Ingame store is pretty much useless since you can have access to all weapons in game and all you need to do is to accumulate money by killing enemies. There are only masks and badges in store and they won't affect statistics whatsoever. Check this out if you want to kill some time or find some free games to dig in.简体中文：毛子做的游戏，挺有意思的。虽然画面不咋地而且武器后座力基本不存在，但是进游戏去虐虐歪果仁还是挺好玩的。毕竟是免费游戏所以不要期待它会有3A大作的质量。游戏内商城基本就和没有一样，所有武器在初始时都已经给了，你要做的就是在游戏里杀人赚钱买好枪。商城里只有名片徽章和面具，然而这些并不会影响人物和武器属性。如果想打发时间或者找点免费游戏玩的话，这款游戏还是挺好的。",1
939,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2018.0,"Yugioh Duel links has been revolutionary for me. I was a big Yugioh fan all my life ever since getting my first cards in McDonalds happy meals. I watched the anime from the original series all the way to 5D's, but didnt follow it after that. Since graduating high school I havent been able to play yugioh and connect with my friends like I used to. With busy lives it just prooved too difficult to gather with our cards to play. When Yugioh Duel links first came out a good friend of mine told me to download it, and I have been playing it since (December 2016). Being a fanboy, I love leveling up the characters I loved from the anime and trying to recreate their decks. I probably play more PvE than PvP in Duel links, but I play PvP for the rewards and when I want a real challenge. I think the interface and layout are good, the stages and duelist levels make PvE fun and engaging, there's always a goal I'm working towards. like any Trading card game it's pretty much a pay to win in PvP, but I dont spend much (probably like 50-70 dollars in my two years playing) and I have plenty of fun. Around Gold level in ranked no one spends much on the game, but Platinum and above is just a spending game. So I've always stayed in gold (a few seasons in plat) and actually dont mind it, it's plenty competitve. I also enjoy the skills added to the game, and that all characters have their own unique skills. I'd definitely reccomend the game. There are regular updates and events every month for exclusive cards. This is the only phone app I havent deleted after a month.",1

The majority of these banned players a community pillars that put a lot of work in providing helpful tools for the community.

Its worth it.Only a few basic ship types available at the moment. But all have very differeent roles and give you very different possibilities to play against the enemy ships.

Yes, up untill you get to the point when grinding new vehicles is going to literally take months. This happens very early and only gets worse the further you go.  Is it P2W? Some premium vehicles are not downright better, others considerably better while some are completely out of their league. Yes you can somewhat get the premium currency via gameplay but dont get make me laugh. Also some vehicles (and so happens usually the most OP ones) can be bought with cash only.

18828,War Thunder,2014.0,"Started playing Warthunder 1/1/14. At first it was entertaining but after 2 weeks of playing it lost it's appeal. I really shouldn't have to submit myself for hours upon hours of tutotials on youtube and reading message boards to understand the game let alone have success at it. I purchased a premium membership and nothing changed. Everytime I get shot down it's by a guy 2-3 tiers above me in a vastly superior plane. Matchmaking needs to be better (I.E tier 2 fly against other tier 2's) but it appears that's not of concern for Gaijin. Since I work and have some semblence of a life then apparently this is not the game for me since I require another three months of watching youtube video's and playing to even begin having success. There are dozens upon dozens of bad reviews regarding this game and all are centered around the 1.37 update which made me realize that it wasn't all my fault as to why I wasn't having success at this game. The comparisons to a ""hedge fund"" and ""ponzi scheme"" are accurate and I'm officially boycotting this game until these issues are fixed.The concept is great concerning the vintage WWII planes. Soundtrack and graphics are also appealing. Flying for 2 minutes then getting shot down by a higher level plan of which I stand no chance against......is not.I purchased the premium membership 3 days ago, I'm walking away from the game and Gaijin can keep the 2700 golden eagles I have on the account.",0

That is a lie and doesn't change the review's conclusion at all. Each game update will force you to re-do the ""fix"" and you don't get any of the steam advantages / achievements.

Essentialy a mini""game"" where you have to explore a dull map just to get the resources needed to get new cards for the main game.

Each one is balanced and focused on a specific role, so you're bound to find one that fits your gameplay preferences like a glove.Don't like being an useless sniper who stands way back, away from the action? Fine, get up close and go with a bow.Your team needs a strong offense in order to fend off enemy attacks, and you're playing as a Medic? Switch from the normal Medigun which confers limited invincibility to a Kritzkrieg for guaranteed crits, no problem.Are you so pro with your aim that you feel disgusted using the stock Rocket Launcher as a Soldier or Grenade Launcher as a Demoman? No problemo, use the Direct Hit or Loch'n'Load to show off your mad skillz and deal more damage as a result of your prowess.Do you love being a soldier, but feel a glorious desire to help your team with temporary buffs? Okay, give up your shotgun and go with a Buff Banner, Concheror or Battalion's Backup so you can help everyone push with increased damage, increased speed or increased defense, depending on your equipment of choice.There are a lot of options available to you.

I have no idea what is going on with Bethesda as a company; but it seems like at this point they are taking advantage of their fan bases. Trying to squeeze as much money out of the franchise as possible and killing the life it has. I was disappointed to hear about TES 6 not being developed for the next decade or so, or the fact that they created a Creation Club, and the fact that they released Skyrim on about a dozen platforms. But this game? You have to PAY to play this game, you literally have to buy the acts to actually play the game. This is a mobile game, they make revenue off of ads already! I found this game fun, but I don't want to touch it anymore just for the simple fact that you have to purchase acts that don't even last that long. There is no real content that you are purchasing, what are they charging you for? P.S. to Bethesda,Please stop ruining my favorite franchise with your money grabbing greed. I would've spent more money on my own accord purchasing packs, but simply won't touch this game again because you are forcing me to dish out money for you.

I had such high hopes for H1Z1 following it through all of development and playing both closed and open betas. I played the day it came out when the servers were so overcrowded you could hardly ever even join a server, I played throughout the introduction of the battle royale system and subsequent realization by SOE turned Daybreak that battle royale was vastly more popular than their main iteration of the game. I watched how as soon as SOE was aquired by a hedge fund and turned into Daybreak how the entire game model turned into a means of producing revenue. This review is not like the plethora of others listed here saying that gun hitboxs are not working properly or that Chinese players and cheaters are prevalent everywhere. This review is mainly here to point to the reasons why this game has become what it is and why it will probably never become what the players want it to be.TLDR Reasons why the game is not worth buying:1: Development rolls out hundreds of new skins for players to spend money on rather than fixing game crippling bugs2: Company is owned by a hedge fund solely focused on earning as much profit for as little effort as possible.3: Weapon hitboxs do not function properly and all efforts at addressing them fail4: Chinese players and cheaters exist on every server there is5: Poor communication from development team and zero transparency about agenda and roadmap",0

The client runs smoothly and the interface is visually pleasing. If your are interested in an online TCG, you should give it try!",1
520,theHunter Classic,2014.0,"I found this game before it came to steam. I played it. I loved it.I continued to play this game throughout the summer of 2013.The main reason I loved this game was because of its community.the ages of people that play this range from 9 to 50. (just a guess)And you may be thinking ""9 year olds? what is this? Call Of Duty?"".No.The kids in this game are friendly and don't use rude language towards your family or culture.every one else is just as much fun to play with.You can even add friends and message them.That is what hooked me on this game.I made a few friends and we would hunt mule deer, rabbits, moose, etc. every day.The community isn't huge, but is also isn't dead.There are competitions happening 24/7, where hunters compete for the highest scoring animal hunted with specific weapons and in a specific location. winning one of these will award you with a trophie.There are also Leaderboards showing peope,with the longest shot to kill ""whatever the animal"", and highest scoring hunt of all time, etc..The game is incredibly beautiful, and you will often find yourself pulling out your camera (ingame) to take a photo and save it. The sounds of birds singing, and deers calling really make the wilderness scene come to life as you hunt for that mule deer buck.This is by far, the most realistic hunting sim out there.Not just because of the graphics or the ambience of the game, but the gameplay.Have you ever spent 6 hours in real time hunting down a deer in a video game? I have.This isn't just a ""sit down, play for 30 minutes and get off"" kind of game. Not even close.Grab a good book and get yourself a warm drink and wait. just wait in that tree stand 20+ feet off the ground.Wait. Wait. Wait.The only bad thing about this game is.. For free, you can only hunt mule deer. if you want to be allowed to hunt anything else, you must pay money. Before you run off thinking that this is a pay to win. just try the game. you get the full feel of the game by just hunting mule deer. If you like it, then put some money towards the game and have even more fun hunting larger and/or smaller game.My overall rating for TheHunter is. 8.5/10",1

With that being said the game so far is pretty great, I really love how they joke and reference the old games and as they always have just joke in general.

Then while you're at it download it onto your phone and play the exact same character and servers. I can't wait to see what they do with this game in the future.",1

16219,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"I can really summarize this game in:""Oh, did you use a Teleport Scroll to teleport to the other City? You got a message saying that the Channel is Full? Well, F*CK YOU! You lost your Teleport Scroll and the money you paid for it!""Easily avoided if the system wasn't f*cking stupid and consume your Scroll when you click to use it and start the Teleport Animation instead of when you finish the Teleport Animation and reach the stupid place you want to be. Or at least give the scroll back when the Channel is Full.""The Channel is Full.""I don't know what they have in their heads to think that a game based on Channels for EACH MAP would work, when you're on a random map, you're fine, but when you try to enter a City, you can't because all the stupid Channels of the City is Full.I will not even mention the Lag, the horrible game optimization and the clunky combat system/combat animations, because I will give the benefit of the doubt of the combat being clunky due to the lag.This game has a cool Class System (even if I don't like the restriction of only Templars able to create a Guild, I like more restrictions to create a Guild, but Class Lock isn't one of them, and the fact that the game don't have an Assassin class because of the Lore, everyone is a Savior and an Assassin class wouldn't fit in the lore and yadda yadda) and art, but for now, you really should avoid it.",0

Personally I try to break my addicition and to not touch it again since I can't stand seeing people with over 2000 hours in it playing like they have never seen the game. It's often on that level.

517,WARMODE,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has a lot of players. That can be a good thing or a bad thing. You will either kill everybody, or everybody will kill you. There is also a BIG problem with spawncamping. Most players camp out at 1 of the 2 spawnpoints in a map and wait to kill you as you spawn. There is a spawn protection, but it does not do much. Other than that, it is easy to learn and you will become good at this game very fast. 7/10 overall",1

194,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWell.. I don't know what I expected, but I should have known better! I figured, hey, why not.. maybe there's something amusing to it.Loading screen tips are grammatically poor and engrishy for some reason. My hair is clipping and wigging out, models clip constantly, the dialogue is *beyond* ridiculous.. like, I get it, it's a lot easier to write obnoxious tongue-in-cheek meta dialog than actual dialog, but there's a line where it's twenty times worse than just the same ol' ""you're the great hero to save the world"" shtick. It also strikes me as ironic that they immediately take jabs at spending the first portion of gameplay wading through tutorials.. and then proceed to make you listen to an obnoxiously written little ""evil"" demon drone on and on and on as a tutorial.Visually it's decent if dated - I assume due to the cross platform aspect. Classes are stale as can be to begin - warrior/rogue/mage. Text is all WAY too big and makes the game look like it was intended for kids that need a high-chair to play. Horrible use of screen real-estate. The ""hotbar"" of sorts in the bottom right is far better, even if clearly mobile-y. Video options were mininal, and I found NO keyboard binding options, no mouselook settings, etc. So good luck if you want to change pretty much anything.As is, I cannot recommend it. I'll readily admit it's mostly personal taste - maybe you can look beyond the positively idiotic dialog and find something interesting in yet another mage that shoots a DoT fire/stun lightning and pretty much nothing else. Each class appears to just have four skills and I don't see any kind of progression within said class from the UI or game's explanation. The animations look decent enough and there's some spell effects and all, but everything is just a bit off sync, causing it to lose any and all ""oomph"" that it may have visually. Abilities feel far from impactful or fun to use and just kinda happen. Some of this may be early-stage latency and sync issues, but it's still an issue at present.After that I got stuck in a loop of server errors and dialog constantly repeating from the first character I spoke to despite trying to talk to others and do quests.Maybe down the line when they actually DO add a bunch of classes and make them more interesting and the server errors and such calm down it'd be worth a poke, but that's only if you can stand what looks like some pretty stale MMO-style play with very limited skillsets and minimal-to-no progression.. and you can overlook some especially horrid writing. Cause if you want some standard-issue stock classes with crap writing in an MMO, well, we all know that options like that are a dime a dozen on Steam.",0

2527,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,"I don't really feel it is necessary to talk about what's good about TF2 on a wide basis, because we all know what is good about it. It's updated from time to time, it doesn't feel abandoned like most multiplayers and it has a large pool of creative fans. Plus custom game mods like Slender Fortress, Freak Fortress and Death Run make the game twice as better. So I'll just point out the negatives.Explosive spam. It is understood in a 30 player server that spam is existant and will forever stay that way. Kudos Short Circuit. It was fun while it lasted.Crutch weapons/shields and overall annoyance. Black Box/Concheror. Darwin's Shield. Reserve Shooter. Beggar's Bazooka. Vaccinator pairs. Degreaser combos. Despite naming these, I bet all of us use them anyway. So I guess you should all feel horrible about yourselves.Mini-sentries. It sets up in less than 3 seconds. The engineer has the ability to pick up his gear; why not force him to ulitize a push with his teammates instead? It's a server killer. When you're on a team that doesn't feel like destroying them constantly, it's dead.Melee system. You may run into some issues with hit registration not going your way, like hearing your melee weapon make it's hit sound, but no actual registration. Pocket medics. This can go both ways and it's understandable to heal just that one power class that's getting most of the dirty work done. We get it. But what you don't get is that you're gaining much assistance as well from the rest of your teammates that is providing much said and needed push. Do the team a favour. Heal everyone (at least those who respect you). People not understanding the difference between Boot Camp and Mann Up mode.The essence of Mann Up mode is to use the most effective loadouts, have a organized team of each class and to get through wave by wave. If you want to mess around, there is Boot Camp.Lag compensation. This takes the cake. Shots will seem off and you'll most definitely have those moments where you either got sniped through a wall or railed through the wall by the Heavy's curving mini-gun bullets. You thought you got past that wall, but you didn't on their screen. Seeing as I play Scout, it's something I notice on a daily basis, specifically against heavies. It's just all lag compensation. Curious to know more about it, I recommend googling it.Critical hits. It's either you get lucky or outlucked. If it's a issue for players, you'll have to search for those servers that host non-crit settings as the known popular public servers don't. There can be humor in it, but not when it's so frequent. Either way, critical hits are random pokes of not fun and it ruin the results of good matches.Servers not tolerating class balance. Not everyone wants to play in a server infested with engineers and mini-sentries/sentries all over the place. Or more than 2-3 demomen spamming stickies everywhere. Whatever the scenario is, this slides right into lack of teamwork and coordination. Things may never get done the right way, so your best bet is to probably just find another server. Try to get a fair team scramble going and all of the average to good players may quickly go to spectator mode to restack again. We are no angels to that. Who doesn't want to be on the better team?Closing comments...Although all of that is what's to dislike about TF2, you'll somehow just find a way to see pass through it all and enjoy the game for what it is. Make some friends, find a favorite server and avoid the awful memes if you can.",1
20298,War Thunder,2016.0,"First off, I used to love this game until the reccent patches made it borderline unplayable unless you play japs or russians. The american planes are always killed because .50 cal is like throwing pebbles at steel and they fly like bricks. The american tanks are armored like they're made of butter. The german tanks cant pin anything (Especially the Tiger H1). The russian tanks are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the grind takes years when the RP gain from matches is 1-3K a match with premium. The Brit planes use cannons to rip the wings off of anything they face. And lastly, all the devs want is your money at this point. The game has become Pay to Win in so many ways, the premium planes out pace all other planes, the premium tanks are bulletproof and the RP gain is impossible to grind without premium accounts T4 and up.

However, the game is not for beginners of this genre, as it does have a learning curve, but that may help with kiddy population that plagues a lot of other MOBA's.

9349,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"Six hours in....It's a good thing this game is free, because Fallout Shelter is the very definition of a grind: inconsequential clicking and long waits with the sole purpose of making small numbers grow into bigger ones. There is actually very little to do. If it wasn't necessary to click on your vault dwellers when they level up or give birth, or click on rooms to collect resources, the game would probably play itself just fine. Raider attacks and radroach infestations are a joke, as your dwellers will easily overcome them without your input. You can equip them with weapons, outfits and pets to make them more effective, but they don't seem to matter much. Their attributes (the SPECIAL stats that Fallout fans will be very familiar with) seem to dictate how well they do certain jobs, and their level seems to have a major influence on survivability; however, despite the wealth of tips that pop up, it's unclear exactly why or in what way these things matter. Is a vault dweller with high Perception better with a pistol than a vault dweller with low Perception? Fallout lore would say yes, but in Fallout Shelter it doesn't seem to make much difference.You can send your people into the Wasteland to explore, where they randomly gain XP, caps and items as well as slowly have their health whittled down by enemies. They can be recalled at any time; the longer they are out, however, the longer it takes for them to return, meaning even more waiting. Once you have the Overseer's Office room, you can also send groups on quests that consistently turn up much, much better loot but again have irritatingly long travel times to and from the destination. The gameplay when they get there is a huge disappointment; click on a room to explore, click on an object to loot it, wait as combat happens automatically, click on the End Quest button when it's all over. Again, with a little automation, this rather boring questing could take care of itself while the player concentrated on more interesting activities - of which, sadly, there are none to speak of.It occured to me at about this point (right before I decided FS wasn't worth any more of my time) that Bethesda missed a golden opportunity with this game. The Vaults in Fallout were each the site of some kind of social experiment. Why on earth did this not carry over to Fallout Shelter? Couldn't we have built the Overseer's Office and then, having built the foundation of a stable Vault, been randomly assigned some crazy end goal to give the player a purpose?Ultimately, though, that purpose is to send Bethesda a steady trickle of your hard-earned cash via microtransactions. The wait times can be skipped or shortened with Nuka-Cola, and random loot boxes - with caps, vault dwellers, pets, weapons, outfits and crafting materials inside - can help expand on your collection of practically useless equipment, and both can be bought from the store. However, it's just money tossed on the fire to push you more quickly to an endgame that may or may not exist. Then there are the little things that make the game....less like a game. For instance, your Vault Dwellers will level up over time, but they stop gaining XP until you click on them to acknowledge that fact. Unless you buy the feature from the store to get around that. Which, if I'm reading this right, means that you can pay Bethesda to remove activities from a game that's pretty anaemic when it comes to gameplay already. I mean, I can see the point (money), but I can't see why Bethesda don't even try to hide it.I think we're hitting microtransaction critical mass these days, in which gamers are so accustomed to pointless cash purposes that devs don't care whether we notice them fleecing us or not. That probably describes Fallout Shelter in a nutshell, so let's get this review over with.Summary: A freemium game with the life and soul of Fallout sucked out of it and a microtransaction system that will make you weep with it's pointlessness. There may be some goal worth working towards later in the game, but after six hours I've seen no evidence of it and have lost all motivation to keep looking. It gets a point for the Fallout aesthetic, but everything else falls flat. Watch paint dry instead - at least you won't be tempted to pay someone to accelerate the process.1/10, a complete waste of time.",0

The new dash feature is completely useless and brings no benefit to the gameplay. I never find myself in a situation where it is practical to move faster in a certain direction when a player can simply do the same and use combos. Dodging is a very important key feature to any competitive platforming game.

However, I think that as a party game is really is fun.A few point of (constructive) criticism though:- Character damage and point counter being in the top right corner is awkward to look at, forcing you to pull your eyes away from the action- Many characters feel very very similar, and while the weapon system is interesting and sets the game apart, a more varied selection of weapons would do the game some good- The vague bar of changing color would be far better suited as a numerical value to show damageI know all of these points could be countered with ""But then it would be too similar to smash,"" but I don't think that's a bad thing.

Ok, next, you have the recoil... you know, that thing that makes your gun kick up when you shoot so that it's much harder to land follow up shots. It's like this in real life too. Then the last thing you need to worry about is weapon damage. Usually, the weapons damage is determined on how difficult it is to use.

However, it is much like the situation with Call of Duty: Black Ops 3:  IT IS PAY TO ADD MORE PLAYABILITY OR FUN TO THE GAME.  With games witch give the option to pay, it is just their way of asking if you want to support their game. I have spent roughly £20 on this game and that was on a pack of cubits and the Chloromanser pack (sorry if spelt wrong). I do get the point that people have spent more money on the game on it than me, but don't go attacking the Devs of this game just because your account got wiped. If it was due to the bandwagon of account wiping, then you should have played on it more. If it was due to an attack on your account, then it is a cause of concern. The Devs cannot really do anything about that which I am sorry to hear about it, however if it is refunded in their currency, then there isn't a problem. On other games similar to this one, this has happened to me and the support didn't help. However, with really supportive devs I think that they will do anything they can do.My Overall Conclusion.Don't give the devs♥♥♥♥♥♥if you lost your items and they couldn't retreave it. However, if you feel personally that they did ""jack"" carry on complaining. This game is subjective, and you can like it one second and despise it the next. I love the game and I think more people should play it, however thatis just my opinion. Thank you for reading.For those who don't want to read this just watch this instead cause it is pretty funny:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AylSEBh8dj4 ",1
1108,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewRealm Royale is an enjoyabe battle royale game. I strongly recommend this game because it is fun and is unique. I say that Realm Royale has shown to be unique because it has added it's own twists to the casual battle royale genre by using the forge, class selection, horses, and by removing the parachute system. The game is new, so it will have a bug here and there, as I have come across a few bugs, but they have not seriously effected my experience playing the game. If I were to say for anything to change it would be customisation, like changing the appearance or just small combat statistic changes (even though I know that this will probably be added in soon anyway).",1

1957,Neverwinter,2015.0,"I love the game, I really do, and I played it years before I ever switched to using it on Steam (and that was only about a month ago, despite the large number of hours listed).However.. I can't recommend it anymore.Why?  They've gone out of their way to destroy the game, especially of late.  They seem to be actively working to drive away the players, and in the last month alone it's worked spectacularly.  In January they had something like 15,000 players through Steam, now they have something like 3,500...Ignoring the stuff everyone else is complaining about (though justified) like the lag and disconnects, they've recently destroyed a player's ability to earn Astral Diamonds (the primary currency in the game) ..yet did nothing to adjust the prices of everything that requires them, making the only way to get enough of them to even get by, is to pay cash.. and with the rate the players are fleeing the game you get less and less Diamonds for the same amount of money, given it's a player based exchange similar to what GW2 has.  Without an adequate supply of Astral Diamonds there is basically no character progression at high levels. I wish I could keep playing, but not being able to get and stay connected to the game for days at a time with lag that will guarantee many dungeon wipes in a row, even with the best of players, it's just too frustrating.  Even with all the extra character slots I bought to try to have extra characters with which to farm diamonds just to try and have enough diamonds to support one character, it does me no good when the lag makes the game virtually unplayable.Truly disappointing to see such a great game be destroyed while the Devs turn a blind eye, stick their fingers in their ears, and keep screaming ""I can't hear you, the game is perfect, I can't hear you, we've never made a bad decision ever""...  :(",0
14054,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI currently have 37h in this game and it's kinda stressing me out sometimes but it's fun. Having played a ton of other card games before I feel like this games balancing is really not on point. There are just a ton of situations where you or your opponent can do absolutely nothing. The legendaries in this game are crazily strong compared to other card games. But what I really don't like is the mana system. It is kinda like Magic: The Gathering (the IRL card game, I don't know how if the video game(s) are the same), you have to play so called power cards to gain mana to be able to play actual cards. This means that alot of times get a hand full of these power cards and nothing to play or the other way around and just lose. Atleast one third of the deck has to be power cards so for example sometimes you draw like 10 power cards in a row with the minimum decksize of 75.In short if you think Hearthstone is a RNG heavy game the luck of the draw that you need in this game is insane in comparison.But if you want to get into this game it's not that hard to craft your first deck because you can farm the PvE modes pretty easily if you have a bit of experiene.The game has pretty interesting mechanics though that need some time to get into which enable some completely overpowered combos that just instantly win you the game.Overall I have to say that I have fun playing this game but I recommend something else until they rework some stuff.Edit: I just got access to Magic: The Gathering Arena and have to say that both games play very similar with their mechanics. Didn't remember it that way. Also you can get a bunch of free packs with Twitch Prime for Eternal if you're interested.",0

18086,AdventureQuest 3D,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewHi all,I have spent 6.4 hrs on this game. I see lot of potential but it's too early to release even the ""early access"".

4921,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"7/30/2017 - 19.2 hrs last two weeks / 19.2 hrs on recordI found this while meandering around Steam looking for new/different stuff to play.I've played Hearthstone and Magic: the Gathering. I quit both because I did not get enough fun proportionate to the cost.This game shares the resource pool mechanics with Hearthstone and the artistic beauty of Magic: the Gathering. It doesn't look as expensive as either of them. Given the game is in its infancy, it makes sense that there are no special formats based on the release date or release set of the cards. The rune mechanic strongly influences the metagame and sets The Elder Scrolls: Legends apart from its spiritual parent, Hearthstone.Deck building is based on a maximum of two of the five ""attributes"" plus a neutral pool, which might as well be called ""colors"" by MtG standards or ""classes"" by HS standards. I see this aspect as a direct upgrade from HS's system, even though (and perhaps especially because) TESL offers no class abilities. This also removes the pigeon-hole effect from class-only cards by essentially allowing you to dual-class. I think class abilities make the game less about the cards themselves. In a card game, I hope the game retains an undiluted focus on the cards.The intro story mode was riveting with its special game modes and meaning-lite choices, and helpful as a tutorial. I look forward to the opportunity to explore the current Dark Brotherhood segments and future story chapters, with the in-game currency.It's a card game. No matter how competitive or wise you may be, there are randomized elements that are both the intrigue and ultimately the achilles' heel of the game. Luck may have it that you win some and you lose some, or that you win many and you lose few, or that you win few and you lose many. Winning feels good (for me), but there are frustrations about what that means when I could be faced with opponents of wildly varying skill levels and deck strengths. Losing feels bad (for me), but there are frustrations about what that means when both players in a match are subject to draw both useful-at-the-time and not-so-useful-right-now cards. Winning or losing too easily feels unearned, and while the rune mechanic alleviates some of that problem, it also introduces some right back.I will hold onto my wallet for now. I've taken a look at some of the starter and one-time-purchase (?) packs available, and I could easily see myself spending $30. I've spent much, much more than that on Magic, but I'm not here to spend money; I'm here to entertain and validate myself in a competitive environment. I believe many of us are.Whether or not you've played other card games, I recommend giving this one a try. Just remember that it's a card game, and like real life, there are aspects of it that are out of your direct control. Never feel too good, or too bad, about the outcome of a match; just play the game, and if you aren't entertained, find something else to do. I write this for myself.~~~Follow up update 7/31/2017~~~It's incredibly easy to burn out on this game. Might as well just show up for the daily quests and then leave, since the rest is heavily based on luck for a newer player without enough full sets of cards to make a more reliable deck.It was quite fun for the first day or two. It really was. Now there's nothing left but a bucket with a dollar sign on it. It really isn't worth my time to ""grind"" for gold/exp/gems, because it will never be enough and it will always take too long.My next review will be in one year after I've accumulated the 365 * 40 gold that should yield. Maybe then there will be a game for me to play. Yes, it's a free to play game. I don't much like disappointment, though, no matter how much it cost.I can't recommend the game in its current form.",0

Capturing bases, blowing up tanks,planes, and turrets are just a couple of amazing things you can do in this game. Although fun the game has a bit grind as to unlock upgrades and weapon one must earn certs wich are earned from capturing bases,kills and repairing/healing.

5472,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"The card draws are absolutely not random. Maybe 95% of my losses I've had turn out like this:No possible moves for the first three turns, playing catchup and hoping I stop drawing either duplicates of multiple cards I can't use for six turns or only drawing exact same type of cards I don't need. (In one match, by turn 2 I literally drew 5 of my 6 item cards in the beginning of a match, with no one to equip them) Then after surviving the ensuing slaughter with less than ten health, stage a miraculous comeback, chain around 10 cards together and whipe out most of the opponenets board, only to have my opponent 'randomly' draw precisely what they need to win that turn. Being defeated with two full lanes after starting with a worthless hand is antithetical to a good game. I don't know if it's an attempt to keep W/L ratios even (which is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mechanic anywhere) but from the beginning of many matches it's clear who Legends has picked to win.

If you're new to this genre, you're gonna have to take some time to fully understand the concepts of the game. It's definitely a lot to take in as a new player, but once you've figured it out it becomes so addicting. There's new leagaues implemeneted every 3-4 months, which allows for fresh economies/new aspects to the game. It's my favorite part. The devs are constantly updating/rebalancing the passive tree (which is freaking amazing), so you shouldn't get to in love with any given play style/skill/build.

As a 6v6 multiplayer, objective-based shooter, it finds accessibility not by lowering the skill ceiling, but by broadening the definition of skill. The person with deadshot aim is no more valuable than the person with the decision-making ability to know when a well-timed ability will turn an engagement, or the person with the map-sense to find the optimal locations to place sentry turrets. While it didn't exactly drown me in options, maps, and modes, it’s blessed with a multitude of tactical layers, and none of them ever came between me and my enjoyment of its intense, swirling teamfights, and thrilling overtime comebacks.",0

Its brilliant... My last game I was the last man standing of my group and a team of 3 cornered me into a house. i threw a turret down before one of them caught a lucky shot which killed me. they rushed in and my turret killed two. by the time the third killed the turret i was revived and shooting at him, he rushed and i swapped to sword and ended him. It was great.... cant wait to play this with friends. and I cant wait to see where the game goes because im beyond impressed already and its still just in Alpha.MUST I REMIND YOU THAT THIS GAME IS FREE?!

1318,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2017.0,"A cookie-cutter Korean grinder with some bizarre anti-player management decisions and a failure in basic communication. A par for the course.Example (mgmt decisions and communication fail): you can't trade with other players until both you and the other player are lvl 40. At least one of you then has to have a premium token (pay 10 bucks; active for a month). And even then some items that say ""TRADEABLE"" in description cannot be traded to other players--only on Auction House.Did that measure stop multi-acc people or bots? Of course not.

746,War Thunder,2018.0,"♥♥♥♥ this game. It's gorgeous and addicting. The grind is extreamly long and many of the vehicles aren't balanced or historically accurate. The models in the game are amazing looking as is the customization. The game is massively frustrating as many people (not just I) go round after round of being killed to never achieve anything. I once played 10 rounds in a row of just being slaughtered, no kills, no captures. Being sniped from accrosed the map in Tier 2-3 games before I could even do anything. I want so hard to like and enjoy this game and it instead makes me want to throw my monitor acrossed the room. To counter point, I have had rounds with many kills and capturess, they're just few and far between. Having played most FPS' since the early 90's, I'm experienced enough to know when a game just isn't worth playing. Sorry War Thunder, I'm done with you.",0

274,SMITE®,2017.0,"What a heart-wrenching review that I feel the necessity to write. My Steam hours are but a mere fraction of the actual amount of time I've invested into this game. I played long before Smite's steam client debut (and what an intial disaster that was).Over the course of time, I've played this game less, and less. I started playing around the time of Xbalanque release, I played on Pandorum eSports in Season 2 and then subsituted for AFK Gaming's Challenger Cup Team in Season 3. In short, I no longer have fun or enjoy this game. I have never been as frustrated or angry at a game as I ever have been with Smite. Hi-Rez has a very infamous streak of making amazing games, there isn't a shred of doubt in my mind that the games they make have nothing short of amazing potential. The fault lies when they stop listening to their fan base. Hi-Rez employees for the most part are overwhelmingly unprofessional, disrespectful, and have no moral compass when regarding their players, or their paying customers. Whilst I feel that the argument of ""I'm a paying customer, therefore I am always right and deserve respect"" is completely illogical, there comes a point where you are at least respectful enough to hear the complaints, constructive criticism, and voices of your fanbase. What's worse, is they don't listen to their professional players either. The players who have hundreds of hours if not thousands just simply theory crafting, crunching numbers, and taking their position very seriously, are completely disregarded in regards to balance. Their focus has been more streamlined in the direction of skins, adventure events, and things of the like, rather than balancing their game, and listening to no one but themselves. Matchmaking is nothing short of atrocious. You would imagine that a player with an upwards of 3,000 hours, would be matched against players of their same skill platform, instead, I am often paired with players with sub 1,000 hours, to even fresh accounts. My elo is in the top 5% of all players, and not only do I get paired with new players, but I get paired with toxic players who are self-proclaimed good players with less than a 50% win ratio. Now all of that aside, let's turn a blind eye to the disrespectful attitude of Hi-Rez employees, and the terrible matchmaking followed by a focus on aesthetic, useless content that holds no substance beyond distinguishing yourself with a unique skin. The bugs. The amount of bugs in this game are absolutely absurd. Fix one, create two more. This phrase can apply to nearly every patch to be released to date.The entire consensus of what I'm trying to say is, if you're considering playing this game, stay away. It is a horrible example of what a game should look like in terms of it's business structure and how it's handled. If you don't believe me, try it for yourself, and give it a week or so, and you'll see what I mean.",0
2904,Aura Kingdom,2015.0,"This is a very simple, yet very complex game. I find it difficult to stop playing and want to keep playing to ""just finish one more quest!"" The only issue i have is that it was not 100% clear how to fight. I found out through trial and error that it was the right-click on the mouse to attack as well as do other things. Despite that it is a very addicting game and i'm having so much fun playing it!Edit 30/12/2015: Since writing this review i have now gotten to level 58 and i'm currently working toward unlocking the sky tower at level 60. I stand by my comment that it's a game that you want to just keep playing to just ""finish one more quest"". As for the issue i mentioned about the controls i have since realised that all controls can be found here: http://aurakingdom.aeriagames.com/game/controls along with tips and all sorts of other bits of help for the game which makes it easier to both complete quests and to know what you are doing. The graphics are really good, the costumes are cute, the game is comples with several different main locations (almost like floors in a dungeon really) as well as several dungeons to play in as well. There are quests you can do on your own and quests you can do with others. I quite like the sound of the guardian knight feature as well - though i have yet to actually try it. In my opinion i would sy this game was definitely worth a play, you never know you might learn to love it!",1

16694,Magic Duels,2017.0,"The Grind.....The most you can win at a time after the campaign is a measly 30 coins per match, playing other players. Yes, you get quests to gain a bit more but these are daily and really make a small impact on coin gain. And each ""Booster pack"" costs 150 coins which only has 6 cards... yes 6.  In comparison, you get 15 when buying real packs.The main problem with this game is new players start with a very small card pool from finishing the campaign and the starter cards.This makes it VERY difficult to compete with other players who have either payed a ton of money to unlock cards or have grinded for months. The game has a ranking system on how many wins you have NOT the strength of your decks. I have been playing ranked matches against 1-7's and i'd say 90% of those ""LOW"" ranked players I'm matched against have unlocked most of the cards in sets. Because too many of them seem to have a lot Legendarys and Plainswalkers.So say you want to pay around how much the previous DOTP games cost including their expansions(around $40) you'll have enough to buy roughly 50 ""Booster packs"".  That's only HALF of one of the 7 sets.So final verdict: I can't recommend this to anyone that wants to pay around the same as the last games in the series and get their moneys worth.And for those that don't want to pay: Hope you have a lot of time on your hands fiend.....Because  At the time of this review I had logged 57 hours and In that time I've only unlocked 27% of one of the 7 sets.

I love the scope of the game, from great bass action, to the big lunkers of the northern lakes, to the fun of fighting rainbow trout in Colorado.  Some parts of the game are unrealistic (Atlantic Salmon in Lake Louise - aka White Moose Lake), but all parts are pure unadulterated fun!  DLC adds even more, and a way to get better equipment sooner.

2476,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewOkay, so I started playing LOTRO as a teenager, but it went south for me when they started letting you buy leveled characters. I've been searching for a replacement MMORPG since. AQ3D is really, really good, for being in its early access stage. It can be improved, but it's enjoyable. I killed a good three hours without even realizing it. However, some things I would like to see : -Guild/Clan options, where members can create a guild and bring friends together in a permanent setting (you can always see when your guild members are online)-Party/Group options, where groups of 5-20 people can come together for big battles (temporary, able to disband, but share kills, XP and Loot)-Messaging/Chat options, OMG please some kind of chat system that allows people within groups, clans, parties, or even just friends, to have separate, PRIVATE conversations. A friend and I were trying to make a plan of attack and someone else kept butting in.-Options from clicking on a person. As it is, you have to go to the top of the screen and click on their name, in LOTRO I could just right click their avatar in front of me.-A map that shows you where you are, where quests are or what direction to go in.-A slightly longer respawn time. The creatures respawn so fast that sometimes they gang up on you.I'm sure these are all things the Devs are planning to get to anyway, but this is my two cents. These are the improvements I'd like to see.",1
7306,Shadowverse CCG,2018.0,"-----Pros------Fairly high quality anime art.All of the cards are well drawn, and the company actually makes TWO sets of art for each card, one for its evolved form and one for its normal form! That's pretty outrageous, considering that you will only be evolving around 3 cards in a game, and once you get into it you'll find that you tend to evolve only a few different cards in each deck archetype. Whether this is a great feature or just a lot of extra work for the artists is a question you'll have to answer for yourself. Also, plenty of male catering; lots of large breasts, exposed skin, and anime armor.-Voice acting.If you play the story you will find all of the characters are fully voiced during the narrative. Not much to say on that one.-Moderate game balance (insofar).From what I could see, your starting experience with the game will be heavily influenced by the contents of your starting packs. They give you 10 of each pack in the current expansion rotation, and it can be fairly overwhelming to look through all of those cards as a new player. It also seems to me that creating new accounts to re-open the legendary pack you start with just to get the legendary card you want is a problem. But low-level matchmaking has yeilded fairly even games overall.-----Cons------""Unstable Connection"" error severely distrups gameplay.In any competetive game a connection error is disruptive. But this error occurs even when your connection is perfectly stable. I've experienced it frequently enough that I started running a connection tracker while playing the game; there was no interruption to pings to the server even when I got this error. The bug causes you to forfeit the match, which is tolerable in casual and barely so in ranked play, but when you're playing in the arena and only get a grand total of 5 games it is unacceptable.-Draftbreaking Cards.I am particularly fond of draft-based formats, because they guarantee variety and they avoid having a rigid metagame. In Shadowverse however there are several cards that you can get in draft that will single-handedly win you the game. These are cards that are clearly designed to be fair in constructed play, where they would tend to be a bit too slow to see play in every deck of that class, but which absolutely dominate in draft. So, unfortunately, this format is not successful.-Complicated.Cards have a huuuuuge amount of text. It's waaaay more than Hearthstone and even substatially more than Magic the Gathering. Probably close to YuGiOh; maybe a little more even than that. Prepare to read a lot. And boy, if a wordy card appears on the opponent's side that you've never seen before you better just guess!----Relative Cons-----Pay-to-Win (kinda).If you are interested in being at the top of the ranked ladder you're going to need to invest serious time or money. I cannot say how this compares to, say, Hearthstone, since I haven't reached that level of play yet myself, but my research on the current meta shows a very high density of rare cards.-Ugly Interface.The menu interface is ugly. I mean, seriously. All of it. Deckbuilding, main menus, settings, battlefield, etc. There's little creativity or appeal in it.-Japanese-Majority.Nothing wrong with it inherently! But it does mean that if you make friends in the game they are less likely to be english-speakers. And of course this is actually a Pro if you speak japanese yourself! I imagine the Japanese version is probably better, too.----Summary----Unless you particularly like the art style, or particularly dislike something about Hearthstone, I wouldn't recommend trying this game.",0
4139,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,"As someone who has put hundreds of hours into regular World of Tanks, this game fell astonishingly short. It takes the game of World of Tanks, and makes the teams about half as big. But what really sucks is it takes WOT and makes it way more cartoony, and childlike, and removes the artillery tanks. That, on top of the smaller teams, makes this a super fast-paced version, and takes out a lot of the strategy, replacing it with ""skill"" If you liked the game of World of Tanks, but it was too slow-paced for you, or you hated artillery, this is for you. Otherwise, if you are/were an avid WoT fan, this game will probably disappoint.",0
16600,Star Trek Online,2016.0,"I just got a new computer so my hours played are shown as a little low. Before I played directly from the original game client that launched with the game. I've as since, downloaded the game through Steam. I've been playing STO since the very beginning, I've always been on and off(that's what she said), and I suppose having a lifetime membership has helped in that regard. After a number of updates, the ground combat, skill system, and crafting have went through a number of improvements, and I enjoy them how they are now. You can play ground combat like a shooter or traditional mmo, but feels good to mix and match now and then.Space combat is the real treat, and plays differently depending on how you equip your ship and what type of ship you use. Large scale battles can be a very nice spectacle to behold.The story of the game starts off about 30 years after the last original timeline movie(Star Trek Nemisis),  and the original timeline events spoke of in the 2009 movie, as such, Romulus has been destroyed. Each story sequence helps explore different aspects of each of the different show storylines. It's also been great to hear Star Trek Alumni reprise their roles.I'm still having fun in Star Trek Online, and will put hundreds more hours into it. You don't have to spend real money if you don't want to, but if you're spending time in the game, it might be nice to give something back every now and then. Star Trek online is a great game for fans of the franchise, unless they don't like space battles or the idea of ground combat. But keep in mind, there are also a few diplomatic missions as well and puzzle solving. That's it from me for now.-Live long and prosper.",1

9263,Trove,2015.0,"WALL OF TEXT WARNINGThis is a huge wall of text for this review, Before people say ""OH DIS GAEM IS ONLEH GRINDIN EEEEFLBFLBFLFBFLBFLBFLBF"" Everyone who plays this game knows that, We love the game because of it because it drives us to get better stuff. Now sit back and read this Wall of China esque text.This review goes in to depth of TroveBasic DetailsTrove is a Sandbox massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed and published by Trion Worlds. The game was released on Microsoft Windows on July 9, 2015.On Launch Day, the game was launched with issues of queue wait, in response the admins to restart the servers three times. Some players were also unable to join Club Worlds or login to the game, But eventually they fixed that issue and the game was much more enjoyable after that point.GameplayThe player assumes the role of a Trovian of multiple classes, There are 13 classes within Trove. Currently, these are The Lunar Lancer, Tomb Raiser, Boomeranger, Pirate Captain, Shadow Hunter, Ice Sage, Candy Barbarian, Neon Ninja, Dracolyte, Fae Trickster, Gunslinger, the Knight, and the Revenant. Each Character has their own strengths and weaknesses making the play style for each varied.Most classes are designed to resemble a particular Biome whilst others are said to be ""Roamer"" classes which do not originate from any particular biome, according to in game lore.Each Character has a selection of unique abilities which unlock within the first few levels of play. Each Character has a main attack, secondary attack, unique passive ability, and 2 extra skills which can be triggered when desired and have in built cooldowns, limiting their use. The Unique passive ability allows the class to utilize their class mechanics, for example the Tomb Raiser class obtains charges called 'souls' either when a set period of time has passed or when an enemy is defeated. The Tomb Raiser can store up to 3 of these charges at any one time and can expend them using their secondary attack ability to summon NPC character minions to help him in combat. Each classes mechanic is unique and allows for a variety of play styles.CornerstoneThere are houses, They are very mobile via signs. These are called ""Cornerstones"" they are homes of a Trovian where they do their basic things like crafting, forging and Loot Collecting and the other sorts. Other Trovians can walk in to your Conerstone and use your things, But not take your items. The Cornerstones are not like Safe Havens, Monsters of the world can walk in to your Cornerstones.Character CustomizationI know most of you people like having costumes and stuff on your characters, Your Trovian's can have that too! Any Weapon, Hat or mask that is placed in the craft station known as the Loot collector, will be destroyed but the style of that item will be added to the players library allowing the player to choose to use that items image as a vanity, instead of the item currently equipped. This applies to masks, hats and weapons only. The new image only affects the appearance of the character and provides an altered visual appearance only. Additionally any item which is destroyed in the loot collector also provides the player with resources, useful in upgrading other items or in crafting.Players can also alter their characters' face, skin and hair styles using The Barbershop without limit, penalty or cost, which can be crafted or found at the Hub zone.This allows for great variety as each player can customize their characters appearance to a high degree.Game EnvironmentThe Hub zone is the central Zone in Trove and acts as a meeting place for all players as well as a way of accessing the lower level worlds until players are able to craft their own world portals.The Hub also includes a selection of crafting stations and an NPC who sells items used for fishing, an in game semi-profession, and sailing.Each world zone contains various biomes that focuse on a specific theme. These include Neon City, a world with structures designed to resemble a fictionalised image of the insides of a computer, Highlands, designed to resemble fields and forests, The Fae Forest, a dark fairy tale like zone and many, many others.Each biome is connected seamlessly to each other and each world zone is open world in its construction allowing players to travel from biome to biome seamlessly within each world zone.The biomes themselves each have their own unique NPC enemies which will attack the player if they get too close, as well as their own unique flora. One of the main features of each biome is their themed dungeons. For example the Candoria biome, a theme based on sweets, chocolate and other such items can have dungeon's shaped like giant cakes, gumball machines or a myriad of other themed objects related to the biome.Each dungeon contains a single 'mini-boss' who upon defeat rewards the player with a large amount of experience, and causes the spawning of a reward chest. The chest contains 1-3 items which are usually the matching quality of the zone but have a small chance to be of higher quality as well as various other resources useful to the player.There are also large dungeons which appear less frequently than normal dungeons and can have 2 'mini-boss' encounters each with their own reward chest and one main boss encounter who is significantly harder but has significantly better rewards.Clubs!Clubs are like Guilds, But they have their own world! The Club world is a zone without dungeons or enemies and is meant to be a central meeting area for members of the club. The Club leader and any other member of sufficient rank can freely build within the zone and can place items normally only placeable within player built homes. Additionally there are some items which can only be placed in Club Worlds.Players can instantly travel from anywhere within the game straight to their club world.Club chats allow members within a club to chat to each other. The club chat is accessed through typing ""/c#"" in chatInitially the Club world consists of a small island complete with grass and trees. The Island is surrounded on all sides by a unique biome called the Sea of Regret which, when entered, is harmful to the players. However, players can built and deploy devices which, when activated, can convert areas of the sea into additional land mass. This allows players to increase the size of the Club World as desired.Players may join up to a maximum of 5 clubs at any one time.CommunityThe Community is generally very nice and helpful to new players, But to those who spam the chat asking stuff like ""HOW DO I CRAFT!?!?!"" will just get Ignored and Reported for Spam. So if you want to ask people stuff, Don't spam.How i rate the game?This game is honestly a 8.6/10 in my opinion, I love the game, The game is very fun and has a lot of replayability.",1

736,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Product received for freeSo I spent some time in this game and I'm gonna be taking a break until a couple of patches after hitting Hunter.I'll just be quick about it since there's plenty of other reviews talking in detail about this game:Pros+Good art style, enemies look interesting+Music is catchy and loops are generally long+Interesting class decisions (Sadhu, Linker, Thaumaturge, etc)Cons- Enemy models are re-used often- Music and audio bug out randomly- ""Interesting"" classes but stale ""meta"" builds most commonI played ToS and had been waiting for it to come out, but upon release I'm fairly disappointed. The base classes feel weak, auto attacks are VERY important to all classes DPS (just give us something more interesting to do!), attacks and spells are unresponsive and randomly fail. But I think okay, I'll give it a chance - level an Archer to Hunter.My Companion AI attempting to autoattack can animation cancel Coursing or Rush Dog, putting the ability on CD and using the SP but doing no damage and having no effect. And not ""every once in awhile"", but due to the awful AI of the companion anyway he'll pretty regularly decide to input a move command or something after you use an ability and nothing happens.I could deal with the game if it was just ""some of the classes aren't that strong"" or ""the game is really grindy"" or ""there's a lot of bots"" but ""this class feels bad to play because the abilities randomly fail"" shouldn't be a problem for a game that had any sort of beta testing.",0

However, this game has SO MUCH LAG that it is literally impossible to enjoy. The few battles I've played without lag were pretty fun, but the servers for this game absolutely suck. Not only that, but it also has very unrealistic damage which makes it really hard to kill since the game isnt all too smooth. It takes at LEAST 3 shots with the gewehr (starting german rifle) to kill someone, and over 8 shots with the first unlockable submachine gun. If the developers enhanced their servers, changed the damage to be more realistic, and made the aiming more smooth, then I'd certainly recommend this game for anyone, but right now theres unfortunately a lot of unfulfilled potential.",0

10158,Dungeon Defenders II,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter quite a lot of time with DD2, the most important item of conversation I think should surround every review of this game is simple: Developers that listen to their players and act on it.I've been playing DD2 since closed beta early access, on and off. I'll go a few weekends playing almost non-stop, come back a 3 months later and the game is the same but different. It's always better. Little things here and there, big changes every once in a while, but always getting more polish, always getting better.That's what matters to me. They know exactly what kind of game they wanted to make and they made it, but they're open to player opinions and requests. Obviously they won't change everything based on what one person says, but if enough people share an opinion they make the change. That's really cool and is what keeps me coming back.",1

Since any bot can have ALL the weapons on it at a time, it has become who fire the first shot instead of trying to outsmart your enemy with distance and weapon type. Teamwork doesn't seem to matter anymore either. Thats probably the main thing I dislike. My friends and I all agree that lack of team work has made it less fun.

6423,SMITE®,2016.0,"Kind of nice game, but such an horrible community.Smite is nice, or that is ""could be"" a nice game.Why?The community, it's plain horrible and full of toxic scrubs.In the lower levels, you will be matched up with players that just started to play and don't know the game yet.That's fine ofcourse, it's like that in all games.But then the real issues start to arise.You will be matched up with so called ""smurf"" players, these players play low level accounts for various kinds of reasons, Banned, suck at (higher) level 30 play, have an account on suspension and need to feed the addiction or just plain love to faceroll the occasional newer players.When you reach the higher levels, another kind of play starts to show.Premade groups (mostly clans) that flat out drop you every time you move forward and just don't support you.I've seen these kind of actions numerous times where groups just ignored another player that needed help, most times they even do it just so they can troll report people and have a nice laugh about it.This game got all kinds of players, the ones who think they are such pro's (and some actually play really good) but have no team play in mind, and start cursing and swearing when they lose or start making comments about peoples builds.The troll that just loves to act like an idiot and starts to feed the enemy team, and just plainly keeps on walking into everything that it meets.And ofcourse the eastern european players, which always have some kind of reason to act like nationalist scum, and i feel that it's mainly because their country is under political pressure at this point. (They deserve their own servers, would take out a lot of grief.)Overall i'm pretty done with this game, a really nice (and sometimes even fun) game to play, but like all of these games they need to earn money, and if you want the nicer stuff you need to start forking out cash and quick, because some skins are exclusive content that can never be unlocked again after it's gone?!So nice game Hi-Rez too bad it's nothing that i will be investing in.

1969,Fishing Planet,2017.0,"Fishing Planet, in my mind, has to be one of the best examples of Free To Play that I have seen in awhile.The payed elements of this game are by no means essential to have fun, or to even reach the highest areas of the game. If you truly love fishing and the wonderful aspects that come with it, I believe you will indeed enjoy what this game has to offer. I have already brought several people to this game and plan on bringing several more, as it has a rich expierence that really anyone can enjoy with a group of friends.THE BAD1.) Before praising the game further, I do believe there are a few issues that are worth mentioning in this review.One of the major issues I had with the game was the hardship and labor you have to go through to simply get into the same game as a friend. The steam join system not being present in this game is extremely painful. It would be a whole lot simpler to have implemented that system, but instead, you have to add someone manually through your game, and at this point it is about a 50/50 chance that the person you added will even show up. Seriously, I tried at least 10 times to delete and readd just to get them to show up in my damn que. I also sometimes wish that you could exceed 5 people at a lake at a time. I wish that the numbers would be increased, as I feel it would help spice the lakes up. 2.) Some people may truly love how deep and immersive the game is, and I get that, but sometimes there seems to be some truly nuanced ""features"" that just make the expierence worse, especially for beginners. The lack of information given to a newbie like myself about the way some of the equiment works, or even just simple definitions on the jargon present in the game really make this a difficult expierence for someone who is simply trying to find a new game that they find fun. I cannot tell you how much ingame money I acutally wasted on gear that I would never need. A simple diagram or explanation on the way things work would really do great assitance here. The ill of this also shows in game as misnformation is rampant on the ingame chat. I find myself asking high levels constantly how things work and what to use, but this typically results in several different answers that are usually flatout wrong. This in my mind makes the game a whole lot worse for everyone involved. I just wish the developers put info more readily avaliable for how to catch certain fish, or how some of the gear even works. 3.) The weather patterns in the game are extremely annoying, and sometimes don't even seem to work. For example, in Texas, for this weak the weather patterns are literally the exact same for the next 4 days, same times, same everything. This is super annoying, because it makes it terrible for actually catching fish. I have also noticed, that when the weather is clear, the fish don't bite as much as it is implied. Sometimes, it feels as if it is literally all randomized, and this also links back with the lack of info in the game. It makes it hard to truly understand what you need to do to advance.WHAT MAKES THIS GAME GREATI decided for this review to put he negatives before, because that is literally all I can say bad about the game, the rest is literally great. The other reviews on this game complain about how grindy it is, or how long it takes to advance, but frankly I never saw these issues. Instead, I have spent my first 30 hours of this game at literally 2 lakes, Texas and Missiouri, and I am perfectly fine about this since the lakes are so vast! There are several spots you can expierment with and explore to find what you want to catch. It makes the game so deep and rich and I am extremely excited to move on past these 2 lakes because I just know the content will be vast! I find that the game also does a great job at rewarding you for your work. Instead of forcing you to purchase items, it sets up a system that encourages you to pay premium to unlock more of your earnings, which is a far better system in my opinion. Infact, it has actually encouraged me to pay for paid content simply out of the respect I have for the developers for doing this instead. Lastly, I think it is important to mention how good the community is, people on it are super friendly and will give any advice that you ask. Infact, I have actually introduced several people to my private community off this game and we use it as a utility to learn more from eachothers exiperences.This game is truly the goto for fishing enthusiasts and also does a great job for introducing newbies to fishing. I really reccomend this game for anyone who has the patience to take it on!",1

6202,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewLevels 1-4 as a character in this game are great. It's totally a skill based matchup where you can go out and have a lot of fun. Once you (or any single one of your friends) hits level 5, the party is officially over. You immediately get thrown into much larger conflict against people who have a ton of weapons upgrades/vehicles that you don't have access to, and grinding levels becomes terrifying.The gold purchasing in this game enables wallet warriors to reign supreme, and completely disenfranchizes those who don't have/want hundreds of dollars to go into a single game.

Expect many one-sided games, gameplay that consists of running and wondering where you are, and a lack of any weaponry that can actually kill someone accurately (the higher-level guns will instantly kill you btw). Don't get me wrong, this game was kindof fun at first, but as you progress you....lose the ability to progress unless you buy up.

There are more things to do and you will most likely unlock a lot by just playing. The Gameplay Mechanics are nothing new but it has some enhancements like taking you to mission areas that look different to gather loot. I think the fallout universe fits very well for this type of game.

We are the primary market for the gold sellers... what that means is that the game gets FLOODED with gold sellers and bots which damn near ruins the experience.

I think if we are about to blow up, we should be allowed to evacuate our ship and decrease our respawn time.-Sniper class is the least useful unless all you want to do is get assists and deaths. Maybe I'm a bad Sniper in this game? But one play through left the worst taste in my mouth. Long range combat isn't very engaging or rewarding, so I'm sticking to close/medium range.Conclusion: -Despite the longer list of neutral or bad, you must understand. A lot of that will probably be addressed sooner or later.Personal Story:I decided to pick this game up today and was surprised how much I enjoyed playing it.The most epic, yet traumatic moment I've had so far was when I finished capturing an enemy base. I spotted a weakened enemy vessel and I went ahead to pursue it in my Enforcer when I heard more enemies are arriving! I glanced to my left and saw four.. yes.. FOUR enemy ships warp in. I said, ""Oh F$%^ me!"" and I was dead in seconds, haha!Despite my most epic moment was me being destroyed, I only went -2.. With 5 deaths and 3 kills. Our team even one, even when the other team was far more coordinated with their assault and maneuvering.",1

2323,Elsword,2014.0,where to begin... well the game is pretty fun and pretty goddamn addicting but multiplayer is a big bucket of smashed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. i think elsword is the only game where i was ever brutally spamed by a level 10 player. this is where i said bull♥♥♥♥♥♥because if a level 10 can defeat me as for me being level 41 then there is somthing horrifically broken with the game. so i did a little research and relised these people that were utterly destroying me had  6000+ wins and 0 losses. now this is an impossible feat. and yet this type off bs goes unchecked. now if you play it by yourself its an ok game but pvp is broken. i never ever cheat in mmorpgs but appearently everyone else does in elsword. if you like pvp then DONT TRY ELSWORD.,0
12335,School of Dragons,2015.0,"School of Dragons, at first, seemed like a promising game. And being a fan of  MMORPG games and the how to train your dragon franchise made this particular game stand out to me personally. However, it could be so much better. On a whole it is NOT a BAD GAME. It really needs a good few changes.Once a character is created, it cant be deleated without having a certain amount of gems. And gems, from what i can see, cost ACTUAL money. This also goes back to the character creation. Its lazy, sloppily put together and it lacks the actual CREATE YOUR OWN CHARACTER element. Your character is either Hiccup or Astrid, with different sleeves, shoes, and hair. The loading times are decent, but theres too many loading screens. You can pass into one area after seing a loading screen, then within seconds be taken to another. almost everything costs gems, meaning if you want more of a personalised character, you need to feed the developers money. Dragons cost money, as do masks, shoes, food. All the basic things require money. Fair enough, the developers need money so they can continue to keep up the servers, update the game (this game needs some serious updates honestly) but that doesnt mean they should make EVERYTHING cost actual money.Character animations could be a little bit better, as could the dragons. Their flying animations are decent, but on the ground it gets a little hectic. Their flying speeds could be faster, or slower depending on the type of dragon. i.e having a night fury faster than a gronckle.""MMORPG based on DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise. Players raise and train their own dragon, interact with characters from the HTTYD franchise, join clans and embark upon journeys and quests alongside their Viking pals in-game."" is a promising description, and these things are done within the game. Just not well. updates are needed, patches too. But on a whole this is not the worst game ive played. And with a few changes, it could easily become much better. Im torn between recommending it and not. I recommend it if you are not a big a fan of the franchise than most, as you could possibly be disappointed if you have your heart set on an ""epic httyd experience""",1
2830,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is great in general: graphics and gameplay are well done. But i can't recommend this game to anyone because of his xp system. It's a grind fest, where you must play a whole day getting the same fish if you want to level up and get access other areas. It's not fun, it's boring as hell.EDIT: after some comments:I did not mean that i will get the same fish when i cast with specific bait/lure and on the specific spot. I mean you have to ""grind"" on the place that give a better, let's say xp/hour, in order to level up your account to get acess to new places/fishes. Trout are a example, i have some friends that spend the whole day getting trouts to gain a single level. And there are fishes that just dont ""worth"" the time because this exp system. I like to get all the fishes, but some species just dont worth the time you spend there.Another thing is that when i get a fish, i don't feel ""rewarded"". Fishes don't really fight, it's easy to get a trophy fish without even care taht your line may break. And since you learned, by yourself or saw any tutorial, how to get a specific fish, the AI of the game will always work on the same way. So if you cast on the same spot with the same lure in the same time (i heard that some uniques are caught exactly at the same minute of the day), you will get the fish. There is no ""random"" things that always happens on fishing irl. Some times you will get a fish on the ""wrong"" place and time and this don't happens here.Anyways, i read the last news and looks like they will improve exactly what makes me dislike the gamWhen this happens for sure i will change my review to positive, because the game overall is good.",0
1697,Crush Crush,2017.0,"The game has okay story to it I guess, but I'm sure everyone is wondering about the graphics... The art is done well, very time consuming (it's a clicker so of course it is, don't be stupid). It's very upfront about what it is, so I don't get why people are giving negative reviews, I read one that said all clickers are the same that they all just require clicking allocating time and managing what you level then get a prestiege... So if you're going to say exactly what a clicker is then put almost 100 hours in just to cry about it being a clicker, don't get the game XD little kids / immature morons reviewing games are amusing because how brain dead the review is... Any who, if a dev is reading this, there's a glitch for people who go into offline mode. Seeing the game requires internet the timers don't function correctly seeing it can't update to the real time of steam (im guessing is whats going on), but the pictures start freaking out at times, like they will freeze or fast forward occassionally I was seeing.

Well they are loot that are in a specific bag color. The colors ranges fromPurple , Cyan and white. White Bags Are the hardest to get but has good stuff inside and you have pets too who has alot ofabilities which can aid you in battle. the places you should avoid unless you have better equips and at least lvl 20 which are Godlands(glands).You can die Pretty much instantly by some gods like Medusa(Snake Head Lady),Leviatan(Blue Creature) and Djinns(blue creature that shoots snowballs) and more.Whenever you feel your screen shaking, its time to meet Oryx.Oh and expect death whenever that happens because he is the hardest boss in the game and alot of players die by him.so i recommend you to nexus or die a brave person.Whenever you die, dont be sad just think about what your next character is gonna be and start over again.Remember Guys, EXPECT DEATH!!-StxofDark(RotMG Username0",1

It is very fast and the cards are displayed very well in large format so you can read their skills/abilities without having to click a lot of crap, deal with pop-ups and load times and bugs.The only thing I'd really like to see implemented into the game is an option to turn off screen shake.

4271,H1Z1,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewJust as one thought that this game couldnt become any worse, they made it even more about the money and micro-transactions. Developers has completely abandoned the gameplay experience and apparently given up on trying to fix the many flaws in the game, and made it all about opening expensive cases and getting rediculous cosmetics.A shame really, the game had potential in the beginning.",0
1402,Path of Exile,2014.0,"Let me start of with the most important point: Path of Exile is the absolute best implementation of F2P I've experienced. I am not hesitant to try free-to-play games out, but I am very wary of pay-to-win or♥♥♥♥♥♥game design caused by a game being F2P. Not once have I felt like any pay-cash-for-me items were being pushed in my face. I'm currently playing through the third and final difficulty, and the game being F2P hasn't gotten in the way of it a single time. While the game is not without its flaws, it is silly to avoid it trying since the financial barrier to entry is $0.With dungeon crawlers there are a few core components that come to mind, that seem to make or break a given game. 1) Replayability 2) Mechanics 3) Skill trees 4) Item dropping/randomization. I will try to briefly talk about each of these issues.In terms of replayability, Path of Exile is fantastic. I got bored of Titan Quest, Torchlight, and Diablo 3 much faster than I have in PoE. I actually hated Titan Quest by the time I finished it, I was just determined to beat it. Diablo 3 I quit during the final difficulty because they were still figuring out how to make the game suck less. Torchlight I just got disinterested in very quickly, although I plan to revisit it in the future.The mechanics are probably the biggest selling point of the game in my opinion. Rarely does casting skills in a game make you feel like as much of a badass as it does in Path of Exile. The punch you get from using some of the skills is quite rewarding. While the gameplay is hampered a bit by lag now and then, by and large the game is very fast paced, and quite challenging at times.The skill trees, gems, and leveling system really are a fantastic piece of game design. I won't try to explain how it works because it is worth exploring and learning yourself. While it isn't without its flaws, I really do love the adaptability the skill trees give you. My second character might not turn out as absolutely awesome as my first did, I feel like I kind of nailed it with my first build. Also, it's worth mentioning the currency system is downright clever.The item dropping and randomization is probably the weak point of the entire game imo. While it isn't completely terrible, I can almost completely ignore loot that drops at this point in the game (~Lvl 55). Most things have such a low chance of comparing to what I already have, that it isn't worth looking. I still do, but it is usually futile. The need to get items with both good stats, AND appropriate gem sockets, is really the core problem. It is hard to hold this weakness against it, as this is something almost every dungeon crawler that exists fails at, especially Diablo 3.The fact that this game is online-only hampers it in the same way it did for Diablo 3. There are definitely lag/sync issues that come up now and then. The ability to play in LAN mode, especially for something like hardcore mode (which I will never ever attempt), is almost essential. This is only a slight gripe, as I haven't even paid a cent for the game yet. I do plan on dumping some money into it at some point, primarily just to support the game/devs.Overall, if you like dungeon crawlers, or even just trying solid free-to-play games, this is one is definitely worth checking out.",1
5575,Trove,2016.0,"Everyone saying the game sucks because its P2W. Everything is pretty expensive, such as getting to radiant for one equip is 30 USD. The game is really good, but the building system is lacking or could use improvement. The community never really talks in game, unless you're using world chat.  This game is best with some friends, as farming alone can get boring, plus with friends, you can stock all items together in one club chest.

No one is watching this game (or playing it) Gold farmers are spamming the few that do play and nothing can be done about it. The devs have definitely moved on to their next cash grab.

You can do it solo, but if you're a tank built..It'll take a while. Moral Lesson: Use your cards wisely.-Marketplace is pretty broken; there are a bunch of over-inflated items that isn't even worth the price.-Bots and spammers all over Klaipeda as well as dungeons, which can be really annoying since they tend to steal your kills.-Collision bugs, a nuisance when riding the elevator because you fall off.-Lag; which bring us to:-Frequent rubberbanding; really annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥specially when fighting a boss because sometime the camera flies away, making it impossible to see what's going on.The game is fun, but  I would not recommend it-- Specially on its current state.

15878,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Ok i think everything has been said both good or bad about this game, on a technical view.  Personaly i LOVE this game and i think it has an amazing potential, tho we paid money to play it one month before it goes F2P. Andddd it's laggy bugged and full of problems that should had been fixed in the last closed Beta really. It's pretty hard to forgive  it feels like they are punishing us for supporting them more than anything else.That being said the game itself is really really FUNNNN it feels like a super nintendo secret of mana game who had a kid with RO.  It's amazing with friends and the skills between the classes mix togheter  like i never seen before, It's a great time.......when it works......but damn me i'm having a blast when it works as it SHOULD be when you paid you know..MONEY.So what i think is if they fix the problems soon and keep on working hard on it  this game will have an amazing future of fun for all of us , and i hope it goes that way. If they don't well.........i guess it's going to die.Now pay 10$ or not?  it depends...its amazingly fun but AS it is now it's really buggy as hell and laggish.

2337,Bless Online,2018.0,Early Access ReviewWaste of time and money. Failed launch and failed first patch within the first week that made content impossible and the pay to win is beyond insane when you look at the pet system and see how strong it is you will likly quit this game. I have played for over a week and got to end game. The devs are litterally trash and made the endgame content go from free to impossible in 1 patch causing everyone to strugle with even lower end leveling. If you like taming pets and pokemon go style games this game is probabbly the only one on the market for that with a system like it. BUT! It is easily bypassed with money. You can get to max lvl fairly easy around 50-100 hours for an MMO thats low but the real endgame is pet taming and crafting wich could offer thousands of hours if you go into it F2P or as little as a few days if your throwing money at it.TLDR: TRASH GAME DONT BUY NOT WORTH EVEN IF FREE!

16041,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewHeroes & GeneralsFor those that played Battlefield 1942, this game will bring back memories and seem very familiar.  First thing is that this game is in Beta and has a lot of work left to it.  However, it is playable.  This game is a set on a large scale warfront between Germans and the US in WWII.  The battles are part of campaigns in which wins, losses, deaths, and kills are added up over a period of time to determine the campaign winner.  Recently, a new non-campaign mode has been added to provide a more balanced game, but the battles do not count towards the current war. The game is multi-platform and has three different gametype options; Action, Strategic, and Causual (hand held devices).  You play as a soldier that you can either specialize into a career path such as para trooper, recon, tank crew, or pilot.  Once you promote to an officer rank, you can command assault teams into battle.  As a general you strategically command the battlefield. Providing different gamemode elements on multiple platforms allows H&G to break away from the standard military FPS game mode.  Business ModelThe game is a free-to-play (ftp) and has a market place/store that is used in the business model (BM).  The game gives a strong sense of a pay-to-win (PTW) in early gameplay because people can pay to unlock better weapons. As players advance and unlock items through gameplay, this argument becomes more of a pay-to-advance (PTA) scenario, however the PTW feature still exists hidden in the form of subscription plans.  Subscription plans ($12 US) cost nearly as much as you will find for a Giant MMO like WoW but offer no where near the content, support, or updates you will find in an MMO.  Why then would you buy a subscription plan?  Simple, to get an extra passive perk and a weapon slot. The extra passive perk and extra eqipment slot is a minimal bonus as you are still locked at 10 slots for carrying equipment.  However, if you plan correctly, it will let you equip things like binoculars.  This my friends is PTW feature however little it benefits you.  This is the sinlge game killing factor for me.  As much as I love to play this game, I find the subscription plan ruins competitive gameplay giving people the extra edge in combat. That is not to say the game isn't fun. The PTW/PTA BM is not nearly as bad as other games like Infestation.  In H&G, the PTW/PTA feature can easily be countered by skill. The game is unbalanced by design which makes it very difficult to point at a PTW/PTA feature as the cause of a lose, but rather the number of planes and tanks on a team vs the other.   GraphicsGraphically this game needs a lot of work.  The textures and animations need improvement, especially the character models.  The environment can use some touch ups and improvement as well but overall not too bad given the size of the maps.  The game design resembles BF1942 while graphically it looks very similar to Battlefield Play4Free (2011) which is designed on the BF2 engine (2005) with some HD improvements.  GameplayThe gameplay is smooth for the most part with some glitches, one of the most irritating is typing in chat.  The chat glitches could be related to key remapping but none the less, they are present.  Bullet trajectory is decent implementing elevation and speed.  Hitting a target requires compensation for target movement and hit point dmg so hitting someone in the head will increase the damage done compared to a leg hit. Vehicle handling is good but sensitive so changes in terrain or hitting objects can cause a loss of control. The biggest issue with gameplay is the very design of the game to be unbalanced. A team may have multiple advanced classes against an infantry based team whereby the infantry based team will more than likely lose without teamwork and advanced unlocks like anit-tank mines and granades. Simply put, it is had to fight a tank or a plan with a rifle.  The battles can be major disappointments and one sided. RecommendationI have mixed feelings about recommending this game.  Yes this game is fun and worth a try but the aggressive PTW/PTA business model is disappointing. And what is worse is that since I intially wrote this review in September of 2014, the developers have continued to alter the game patch after patch expanding the grind to unlock items as well as raising the cost of items which makes it harder to play and not pay any money to unlock items. The game is still fun and the PTA/PTW BM can be overcome by skill, but expect a heavy and lenghty grind that lessens the value of playing this game.Video ReviewThis is a video of my intial first impressions in Sept 2014.

5325,Brawlhalla,2016.0,This Game is the closest to SMB4 its just....just so good my god i love this game wew boii.All Righ so after 1k hours jesus i have no life lmao. This game is a lot of fun you can do sick combos and the play style is different from SMB4 it feels lighter not so slow. the game had a lot of changes over the past year some good some bad and i feel like in every game there will be some things that people have differnet opinions on for exaple dodge was switched with dash.Dodge : You where able to dodge right into the other players attack and get 0 damage.Dash: Dont try to dodge becouse you will get hit no matter what you do now dash lets you move faster which some players love.The community is some times very toxic not Over watch toxic but toxic if you can keep your cool and play on with out loosing you head then you can play this game.Since I do youtube videos i love the combos you can do they are just out of this world if you want to put Smash bros with Brawlhalla well i feel like brawl has more combos especially in 2v2 oh my lord the things you can do its nuts.In the end yeah you can play this game grab a friend and check it out remeber tho its toxic some times.Last thing smh the ranking system i am not a fan of it just makes me un happy i am a competative player but some times i just like to cool it and go play Free for all and beat some randome people.Well this was my review after 1k hours enjoy the game and see you in ranked. ^^,1

7809,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2017.0,A year ago Tree of Savior was a game that I liked but refused to recommend to people because of it's buggy and broken state. However a recent update has fixed quite a few issues and while the game is by no means perfect it is definitely playable and a game I can now recommend.Many features in the game are divisive however and it is the type of game where certain things that are working as intended will frustrate certain players while other players will love them so definitely try it out to see which camp you fall in.,1

15976,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewUsed to play this game a lot because it was fun. It was fun grinding games to get myself a set of the best armor and watch as all of my bots slowly turn black, the color of the highest tier armor back then. They removed the tiers and all my grinding went to waste; I am okay with that because the armor was cheap and I could buy literally millions of them after every match because I was using a megabot; they then removed megabots, I was sad but the game was still fun to play. There were things to build and things to look forward to. My efforts in game was reflected in my rewards after every match. Now the rewards are no longer really based on skill, its all RNG now, you could do the best in the entire match and get worse rewards than the player on the bottom of the scoreboard. You don't get money anymore so you have to rely on RNG to get the item you want instead of just saving up. TL;DR:Rewards in game are based on RNG instead of an earn-money-buy-item, The rates are worse than a japanese waifu phone game. Your efforts in game no longer match your reward.",0

16944,Crush Crush,2017.0,"Game design actively encourages users to spend money for basic gameplay as opposed to other idle games where monitization is much more subtle. Learning skills and earning money (used to buy gifts and dates) is done by allocating ""time."" Time is earned with in-game achievements by advancing your progress with each girl. Time slots can also be purchased with cash, or the special currency awarded with in-game achievements. There's NO CLOUD save though, so think twice before making any purchases. Accumulating 60 gems (i recomend to use buying 10 time slots) can be done easily within 2-3 days. Anything beyond 60 takes considerably longer as they are only rewarded for gaining new achivements which become progessively time demanding. Resetting the game increases productivity speed in skill upgrades and work but does nothing to increase the power of your clicks on the girls. Fortunately, as cooldowns get shorter, you rely less on clicking the girl and more on clicking the ""chat"" button. The chat button becomes stronger the higher level your hobies are. Each girl has a preffered hobby that powers up the ""chat"" button. Starting out every game is the same boring click fest each time, and my tendonitus is unforgiving. Progression is much easier when you download mouse recording software (like the free Mouse Recorder Premium) and make a macro for the first 10 minutes of the game. This is by far the easest way to accumulate the reset bonus which makes getting later achievements much more manageable, if not FAR less engaging. Why am i still playing this game you ask? Arin from game grumps played it for Holloween and now i need to know the ending...",0

If your pc can run it, just try it out and stop wasting your time reading reviews.",1
18911,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016.0,"UPDATE 18/02/2017: New insight on the game. You can read my old review below.Since my last review, which was posted in July last year, not much really changed. Just some 'small touches' by the devs, you know - they added sprays to the game, so now instead of having a small chance to drop a half-decent weapon skin you could sell on market for some profit you now have an even smaller one, with sprays dominating the drop table. And, yeah, they're cheap as hell. So if you wanted to profit out of this game, I wish you luck.Other than that, they introduced skinnable gloves. So yeah, with knives being the past 'most expensive' skins in the game, now you have gloves, which are even rarer. As you can probably tell, Valve's moneygrab tactics are blooming.They recently announced that they're working on a remake to de_dust2. Great to see they're focusing on the most important things that should be fixed, instead of wasting their time with a map revamp </sarcasm>.What about the matchmaking? Glad you asked. Prime system doesn't do much, as people can register with throwaway phone numbers and still be queued for Prime. Which means that it doesn't help jack. If you queue without Prime, however, your chance of encountering a cheater rises up to approx. 95%. Not sure who still uses Overwatch, but that doesn't seem to help. Reporting people wields results after long periods of time, or not at all. I wouldn't be surprised if at this rate Valve partnered up with cheat providers for more profit, since hacking in this game is easier than stealing a kid's candy... and seems it still goes about unpunished.And, almost forgot, they introduced public lobbies. For the first few weeks it was what you'd expect, random people jumping on your lobby and starting to screech autistically. Now? Hey, now you have like 7-9 bots instajoining your lobbies that you can't kick.So, yeah. Still broken, and Valve still doesn't listen. Cause, you know. MONEY <3If you like shooters or Counter-Strike in general, do yourself a favor and play the good old 1.6 or Source. Global Offensive promised to deliver an upgraded experience of those good shooters, but, as it is universally known, they stopped at promises only. While the improved mechanics of the game and the indulging competitive mode are welcome additions, if you came for those reasons, well... you will be disappointed.This game had a rough start, and I'm fairly sure you know the story. It wasn't too well introduced, hit near-rock bottom and then scored a 'miraculous' revival thanks to the skins update. That's when the devs really cared for the game, and tried to provide as much as they could so that the players liked it.Sadly however, they stopped as soon as the downfall of the game was no longer imminent, as at this point it seems almost absurd to consider the game as successful as CS:GO dying out in the foreseeable future. And that's exactly why it's no longer as good - the game is plagued by hackers and smurfs, essentially destroying the pure pleasure of defeating an enemy in close quarters, scoring a faraway headshot with a pistol or winning a clutch. Surely, those feelings are quite alright - but they are buried really fast upon encountering somebody who's not abiding by the rules.VAC is no use, devs haven't devised a way to avoid matchmaking you against a smurf, the greatly promoted Overwatch system stopped bringing relief after a while and Prime Matchmaking doesn't look promising either. Competitive games we all enjoy playing are now a lottery - you either get a complete one-sided slaughterfest thanks to unfair play, or finally get a room to breathe and play a single well-fought game, with a chance of somebody joking around and killing the pleasure yet again.The icing on the cake is, as I already mentioned, the skin system. Instead of focusing more on the security so that the game is actually playable, we're getting balance patches so that the pros can feel a little different during tournaments, new cases to milk the money out of twelve year olds' parents and more useless stuff. In short... not recommended.tl;dr: the game is STILL full of hackers, smurfs, trolls and raging kids who 'f*ck your mother'. It kills every little bit of enjoyment and at this stage, I wouldn't recommend buying it... maybe when valve drops another sale and starts caring for our enjoyment and not our money for once.",0

15375,Fractured Space,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI know i know... less than 3 hours played... clearly not enough time spent to fully appreciate this game.Oh, you just realized its EARLY ACCESS? moving right along...As of 3/4/15 this is what i think of the game:AwesomeOne map so far.A handful of ships to use, all different strengths, weaknesses, and skills. (Assassin class is my personal fav)Bots fill in empty spots on teams that are missing players, though they are NOT smart at all. You start shooting one and it will stop in place and only try to line up direct shots; making thier death that much easier. And the point difference between killing a player and a bot is marginal. You get around 40 more xp for killing a player.Graphics are wonderful. The deatail on the ships is well done. Turrets move with your cursor, thrusters fire off with movement (Small thrusters on different parts of the ship for turns), and damage to different hit locations are amazing. I.E. You take a bunch of damage to the engines, its starts to burn and spark. So far, no actual impedement of abililties/ movement from ship damage. Shading is well done. Its nice to be able to see an enemys' shadow on an asteroid before he cloaks, giving you at least an idea of where he is at.Sound is great. Voices are well done, for what they are in the current state of the game. Mostly little reminders of where enemies are attacking and such.Controls are ok. its nice to have different keys for up and down movement, but after playing any other space flight game it kind of seems a bit unneeded. just add mouse based movement (would be my best suggestion, with the add of cruise control that actually WORKS lmao). i dont know.. id be more used to it if i wasnt playing Star Conflict in the same day.Overall this game is a WIN. Do yourself a favor and buy this game and give out the free passes to your friends.heres to hoping they add parties/ groups :stein:",1
15838,Path of Exile,2015.0,Path of exile has to be one of my favorite games of all time. I've put a decent amount of time into the game and I've still got alot of things to learn. I'm a huge fan of hardcore and I think it really adds to the game. When you first get into the game it feels slow and you have a lot to learn. If you take the time to get past that hump and stick with the game I'm sure you'll learn just how good of a game it is.,1
1547,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewPros: - decent character customization- i really liked the fact you can tame pretty much anythingCons: where do i begin..- graphics are not up to par with what i expected. yes, it's an older engine but the world just looked so bland and boring- unoptimized. FPS was way below what it should be for the computer i had- as a ""founder"", my rewards were locked to the first character i created. also, you can only create 4 characters per server. on top of that, i was forced into a faction- content that was promised was not released (ie. end game). i was also getting drops for classes that they had said they would release at a later date- everything felt too easy. you could solo the first two dungeons. you could autopath to every quest NPC/area. while this might be fine for a game like BDO where there is no flight path to anything, this game has multiple fast travel methods- poor translation of skills, notifications ""You are now 11level"", ""Attack for 26 and make gain 1 rage""- i felt that given this game has been out 6 years, the level of polish in this game was not up to par. it just felt clunky and unrefined. and i did try multipe classes and found it the same.TLDR: i had low expecations and it still didn't meet those expecations. i paid for the deluxe edition  ($93 CDN) and thankfully i was able to get a refund. i will maybe give this a try later on when they, i dunno, actually finish creating the game.",0
5405,Paladins®,2016.0,"After playing both Paladins and Overwatch, I must say, they both are very different, gameplay-wise. The only thing similars are the skills and some character designs.

Overwatch is your standard FPS hero shooter while Paladins is Half FPS half MOBA.+ Free to play+ NOT pay to win+ Minor microtransaction+ Balanced characters+ Great even in low spec computers+ Easy to learn hard to master+ Cards customization for skills and abilities+ Good and responsive developer- Complicated login- Server sometimes has problems- Long waiting time for some- Lots of noob not playing as a team- Competitive match is still a problem- Just 2 game modes so far- Not many mapsIt's still in BETA so lots of improvement will be made.So far I'm enjoying this game very very much.",1

6612,Brawlhalla,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewPlayed a couple quick tournaments against bots.  So far, I really like what I've seen.  Took me less than a half hour to feel like I really had a command of the movement controls.  Will take a little longer to get used to the characters' signature weapons, but it's fun to learn each one.Some cool design decisions:* Lots of recovery options, so you can almost always get where you want to go on the stage, but if you get hit, you get hit pretty hard.* Each character has two weapons available, so you can switch your moveset mid-match (item spawns willing) to try to improve your match-up.Matches tend to be pretty fast and fun.It's free, give it a try!

18021,AdventureQuest 3D,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIt isn't fair to review most MMOs after just 10 hours, but this game is an exception. Though there is a major benefit to being able to play a game on your computer and pick up the same one on your phone, the negatives outweigh the positives. As a kid, I loved Artix Entertainment games which focused on style and simple gameplay mechanics over a hard-core experience, however this game just doesn't work with their formula. Why? Its an aboslute grind fest, with too much attempt at being a larger scale MMO than their previous game. I am more than half way through the game, and so far not a single minute has been fun. Nearly 90% of all quests (which are needed to level) are ""kill this, fetch that"", with uninteresting combat that the developers tried to cover up by making it more difficult to survive more than one mob at a time. My question is if this was the goal why not just make AQWorlds mobile, espcialy with all the upcoming popular Eastern MMOs coming to mobile platforms? Its a game not necessarily lacking in features, but in quality at its core. Would not suggest.",0
16657,Elsword,2015.0,"I played this game way back when Raven was new in the NA server, the game is very enjoyable but is sadly drowned in microtransactions that will effectively make you stronger than anyone that isn't spending money on the game (or p2w). I thought I'd try picking it up again because I used to play it a ton with some friends of mine but I just can't get back into it. The community is also pretty childish at times and can be rather rude too.tl;dr: Game is good but p2w elements and community really ruin the fun.",0
2420,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access Reviewso where do i start? First off the game looks great for whatever engine it is running, it is also understandable that the game is in beta/early access and a lot will still be implemented... I am giving this a thumbs down for now since it is far from being finished and the fact that the cons outweight the pros...try the game out. im pretty sure you will love it up until you pass level 3 and/or encounter these issues more and more...Pros :If you are looking for that WWII feel, one where you and your buddies can feel as if you are part of the inglorious bastards, or part of the team of FURY then this game will most likely put you on the right path, it has nice maps and i feel they are made nicely and seem pretty balance where no other team will dominate simply because its better for them starting on whatever side of the map they are...  Sadly that is the only Pro for this game so far...Cons:PAY PAY PAY... although it is possible to get pretty much anything with the ingame currency you will have to force yourself to grind grind and grind some more just to get that upgrade. (note the higher you rank up the more credits you get). like every P2W game anyone with the cash to blow will always out power you. The slow climb to power (weapons and vehicules) will always leave you on a disadvantage...Balance is so far an EHH factor since 7 out of 10 matches i played one team out number the other with tanks and planes, which results to a quick end game, fastest round i played so far from start to finish was 3 mins.Dont expect to be able to upgrade your weapon like you would in todays FPS games, there is no scope attachments or suppressors, but you can upgrade the triggers, barrels and so on (the little things) YOU ARE STUCK WITH IRON SIGHTS!!!! until you unlock the sniper rifle, which you can get once you reached the RECON class, which is some way away and would take anyone some time to get unless you pay with real money. same goes with the upgrades... You will forced to bus the Veteran pack membership if you want to level up faster which costs 2400 gold that you have to pay for with real money and there is no option to buy that much gold so you are forced to buy more gold than you need, which is about 4700 gold for 19.95 Euros below that it is 2200 gold for 9.95 euros...The hit boxes and damage effects is another thing thats messed up at the moment... for example i snuck up behind a tank to place these Anti Tank grenades on it, for some reason the gunner saw me, how? i dont know since the pilot and gunner have a very minimal point of view (dont think Battlefield when i say limited i mean you can look a few degrees to the left and right, and see next to nothing since the scopes you look through is way to dark, makes you wish for night vision) anyway then the gunner jumps out and starts shooting at me, at this point i already places the ATG on him so i ran for cover, as i reach my cover i turn around to see the gunner standing right next to the tank and i watch the tank explode in a massive explosion and i watched the gunner just stand there in the brunt of the explosion with not a care in the world and just kills me with one shot (note i had full health)...Damage, like ive mention above this seems to be off by i dont know how many factors, forget the invinsible tank gunner for a second and lets go to the weapon damage, you start with the standard rilfes of each faction, The US using the M1Grand, Germany  Gewher 43 and the Russians the SVT40... then you get a sniper riles one unscoped and one with a scope (scoped can only be purcashed once you reach RECON CLASS or with REAL MONEY). now damage can be upgraded by upgrading your weapon like the Trigger, Barrel, Sights, Ammo and Internals which is the bolt or spring... I have the russian sniper rifle which is the Mosin-Nagant 1891 upgraded for maximum damage and for some reason it still take more than 2 shots most of the time to kill someone, which others seem to be getting one hit kills by shooting you on the leg while you have full HP... Could be hacks or could be there is something that i am missing? who knows..Objects have rough edges there are countless times where i find my weapon aimed perfectly at someone and clearly nothing in the way of my weapon and ones i shoot POOF invisible wall saves his life... Example i saw a guy proning about 50 meters from me. which is an easy kill, he was looking my way but was busy shooting at someone else, i had a perfcet shot on his head since he was proned and it was the only thing i could see of his body, so i lined up my shot places my sights right on his head and took the shot, and of course invisible wall saves his life. so i line up again to take another shot since he didnt see me yet. i fired, and yup you guessed it invisible wall again, so i move a little to the left *note he is on higher ground so all i can see is his head and it is the only thing i can hit, so standing a little to the left now i took another shot at his head, but instead of killing him (with my maxed out damage upgraded scopeless sniper rifle) all it did was damage him even though i had a pefect shot at his head). He saw me as a result of this shot so i take cover behind a boulder and started to reload my weapon the all of a sudden bang i get hit with a headshot, so im like F**k someone was behind me. buuuut noooo it was the same guy according to the killcam... and this has happened a bunch of time on different matches and maps... latency issues? hacks? unsmooth edges? who knows... There have been an extreme amout of BS deaths that just makes you stop and wonder like WTF HOW? but then you just stop and think the game is still in BETA and there will be issues, but once it happens often you just stop and think ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!!! the game is still good though if you have friends to play it with, i wont recommend it if you want to play it alone at the state it is now, you will just spend most of your time wondering how the F**K did he manage to kill me like that or how the F**k did i manage to do that...Jumping in the game is also broken, most of the time the command does not even respond and when it does you will feel as if you are playing Counter Strike with gravity off, you jump high and it takes you a while to get back down, ive gotten a bunch of kills like this, it makes for easy targets...Match Making is also another headache, which results in unbalance like mention above. if you make a squad you are stuck on the squad page, so everytime you want to make a change or an upgrade you will have to leave the squad and make your changes and get reinvited back in... a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥if you are the squad leader...If you leave a game you have a lock out of a few mins from the looks of it, kind of like in NOSGOTH...All in all the game is good aside for these things which kills the fun to be honest but the game is still Beta and i will stick around to see the finished product, but for now it gets a thumbs down until these issues are resolved.Including the unbalance, this game is reall really really bad when it comes to balance, there are no words for how unbalanced this game it... i fly Russia, and ive never been in a single round where there were more than 3 pilots on my side, worst balance i ever had was 3 pilots vs 11... 11!!! like is i said, there is no balance in this game, one side will always out number you with tanks and planes!!!!To sum it all this is like playing Day Of Defeat/Battlefield... only it is unbalanced because of the P2W factor and because of the issues ive mentioned.",0

17679,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,"Product received for freeAlthough I do enjoy playing Blitz doesn't necessarily mean that I support each decision that WG has decided to take with this. In its earlier iterations, it was more akin to WOT-lite, whereas now although still retaining the main components of WOT has changed it's feeling. 1.NOT EVERYTHING IS BADThough I am still just quite the casual gamer, I do find enjoyment when I can find those random matches with others and have a bang up time because teamwork is awesome. Being able from time to time unlock premium tanks is a plus. IE Tankenstein and now the GuP ""Kuro Mori Mine, Panzer Anko SP., and the Hetzer"" is quite nice.2.GAMEPLAYDoesn't last all too long and is often quite enjoyable, it's called BLITZ for a reason. Adding new lines slowly and fleshing out old ones is always appreciated. Though there is a disparity in ability for PC vs Mobile since its expansion as PC users can more easily maneuver and aim than when compared to mobile touch controls. The implemented non crossplatform option works as advertised though it does limit the pool of players thus I find that I use my PC as opposed to my iPad.FINAL THOUGHTS ( June 10, 2017)-Thouroughly enjoyable for all players looking for tank on tank action though some mechanics are far from perfect-MOST content unlockable without having to pay, though it is a struggle especially with some glaring ""money grabs"" though it is a company providing entertainment has to make its revenue somewhere-Sweet visuals and asthetics as both the vehicles and environment are pleasing to the eye-Events that keep one coming back for more as well as implemented clan/training rooms",1

14630,Robocraft,,"really want Free Jam to read this and new players to understand that I am speaking from a veteran's POV. This isn't meant to be a harsh. I want to make this review as detailed as possible (except the 3rd paragraph) for people who read this and for free jam. I can't ""recommend"" this game YET but I do encourage people to try it. Robocraft has to overcome some hurdles before I can safely recommend it (I REALLY ENJOY THE GAME, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT... I also want to emphasize that with each update, I have adapted to changes and ended up enjoying them later on). I want to give an overview of how I feel about robocraft and I will try to give an effective outline of what I want to say. This isn't me defending or bashing the game. This review is meant to be fair.I want to talk about the current movement system of robocraft and how I feel about it. I want to talk about the current weapons in-game and how the current balancing is. I want to briefly mention the Factory. I want to briefly mention my feelings about the current maps (in general, not specifically). I want to talk about some issues I have with the current matchmaking (this won't be your typical ""It Sucks or ""I love crushing noobs"" or ""I get crushed by every meta/ pro user"") and offer a solution. I want to talk about the use of bots in matchmaking. I want to talk about my problems with current custom game options and offer solutions. I want to talk about Robocraft's community (There is might be some SALT in here. Be Warned). Finally, I will finalize with the largest problem I see that is really hard to deal with and propose solutions (If this is resolved, then I think it will help the game as a whole).The Current Movement system is VERY player friendly. You can even have more than one type of movement on your bot. Anyone can make a plane with enough wings and propellers. I am not even joking. I made a Ugandan Knuckles Fly.  You can make tanks as well via tank treads. Mechs are also a good choice for players who are used to first/ 3rd person point of view games. Camera controls are set as default to help people out. Keyboard controls are good for some planes and all tanks. Wheels are good for making meme vehicles and good for starter bots (not the ones free jam has for the new player). I don't advise them in tier 5. Heli-Copter blades are cool since you can strafe and have a ton of mobility options with them. Hover blades are very easy to use and if used in a broken fashion, very Overpowered. Currently, if you place a hover blade under your hover craft, you float higher. My solution is that Hovercrafts floating height should be based on center of mass instead of the lowest hover blade. Also, give the different tiered hover blades different max floating heights based off of tier. Insect legs are very bad. They don't do as their were originally intended to do. When I use them, even when I don't violate their carry limit, they slowly fall down the wall. They don't cling to ceilings. As a solution, I made 2 insect bots that do these things but I had to use thrusters (alot of them) in order to get them to do this (If interested, look up ""Block Widdow"" or ""The Hanger"" in the factory, use keyboard controls). The hanger demonstrates perfectly what I want in wall clinging but can't turn on ceilings very well. The Block Widdow demonstrates what I want in terms of clinging to a ceiling and can turn just fine, but it doesn't have enough thrusters to keep it pinned to a wall perfectly like The Hanger is able to do. If insect legs get reworked, the camera will need to be reworked to allow people to see better when they are on ceilings. The current weapon balance in tier 5 is... Terrifying. The Mega Plasma (with the help of the trusty Power Module) CAN completely destroy robots with a well place, accurate attack on a ground vehicle. The Rail Impaler has turned away from being a heavy sniper into a ""rapid"" fire precision based weapon. The Mega SMG gun, well, its fine. The Flak Cannon is seriously weak. The LOML deals an absurd amount of damage and is now replacing the flak cannon as anti air. The Mortar got nerfed hard, which I don't know how I feel about that since I started maining it until it got nerfed. The Shotgun (Ion Distorter) feels useless. Until weapons are balanced in way that is SATISFYING to FREE JAM (and the perhaps the community), robocraft should not receive anymore weapons. I feel like everytime a weapon was introduced, everything was nerfed to accommodate it instead of the other way around. I am unsure on any solutions on how to balance these different weapons other than testing them on different types of bots that are block spam (I consider block spam as the control group in this position). P. S. T0 smgs need an increased fire rate.The factory was a huge risk that paid off until meta started to take over. The factory made a war between fighters and builders. The Fighters obviously win. I see far less builders than I do fighters in tier 5. The same goes to T1. I don't think there should be T1/T2 bots on the factory so that new players can get the experience of using and fighting against genuine, creative, original robots. I have no solution for this because this to me has irreversible damage.In regards to all the maps for normal gameplay, I feel like they are too small. The old maps from the beginning, were really cool but I think Free Jam made them smaller to accommodate the smaller player base. I think there needs ro be more maps. More Maps with some new gimmicks, like parts of the map move as time progresses or if lever/ buttons are pressed. Or places for smaller bots where bigger bots can't travel. Or a an enclosed, cave like maps that include darkness, to make use of neon cubes and headlights and a reworked version of insect legs.In Regards to matchmaking, casual players and competitive players shouldn't mix but I think they were meshed together to adapt to the low amount of players this game currently has. When this game gets its player base up again, Have a League mode where all teirs are meshed together. Keep the current tier system the same. In regards to custom games, I think there should be a public/ private settings on it. I mean like allow people to random join. People will host games and people can search for your custom game in a some sort of menu. The Matchmaking system in forged alliance is a good example. For when the movement system is adjusted to f=ma, add an option in custom games to enable speed boost.The Community needs to stop preaching that this game is dieing. This will turn off new players to this game. I don't care if its a fact, everyone knows that this game has had a declining player base since loot crates were introduced. When Free jam introduces good content, the player base spikes (looking at steam charts) Robocraft already has damaged reputation and that in itself is hard to overcome. Free Jam needs the player base needs to offer solutions instead of ""The game is dead"". Other than that, the community is cool. Lots of people are willing to help out. Also, New players shouldn't be able to get access to T5 parts so easily.Now to get to the root problem that plagues Free Jam. The main center of conflict that Free Jam is wrestling with is the current lack of players. Solutions? Well I think if Free Jam can introduce new content (other than weapons), great fixes and focus on fixing problems first, at a high enough quality, at a high enough rate, then this game will flourish. For content ideas, I would like to see a grapple hook of some sort that you could swing with. I would like to see with this grapple hook that it could be used to carry team mates (like a heli carrying a tank) or pull you towards enemies. Thank you for your time. I encourage Free Jam to do well and the current community to help them in their journey. Again I can't recommend this game yet but I encourage people to try this game and share their views on it AND to share ideas.",1
8962,Creativerse,2016.0,Early Access ReviewIn itself this is a good/solid and fun game... The comparison to Minecraft(to me personaly) is weak... One does not(simply) compare/call copy or clone Oddworld Abe's Oddysee to Dangerous Dave for being a platformer or Halo to Hexen for using first person view... It is just your age and recent memory... Does it lack in some aspects??? Sure it does... Does it have more in others??? Yes... But my point is to drop the Minecraft (that I did play for a period of time)... And just play Creativerse...   But only if ti rocks your boat...,1

15854,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI DO NOT RECOMMEND PALADINS TO ANYONE IN IT'S CURRENT STATE OF P2W!Well, I had so much faith in Hi-Rez. At first untill now, I generally thought they were a fair, kind, and charming company. Friendly developers, frequent interactions with their community and most importantly; their ambition to make Paladins -their main and most popular game- better.Recently, however, Hi-Rez released OB64 (the 64th update in Open Beta). OB64 applied the most changes to the game in one update, and I was pretty hyped for it when I saw the trailer. But when I watched the trailer and looked at the patch notes, I noticed a significant change: The new 'Cards Unbound' system.In the previous cards system, you could use an easy to get, mass produced currency called 'essence'. You could unlock essence by winning games and completing quests, along with using it to level up cards that change a certain champion's statistics and playstyle up to a maximum of 12. This gave players the ability to freely customize their cards, while selecting what cards, builds, and playstyles they were comfortable with. That was what made playing the game balanced, fair and enjoyable.But in the new cards system, the only way you can level up a certain card is to repeatedly open loot chests and hope for the best untill you get a duplicate of that card. Getting a dublicate of a card will level it up, but only to a maximum of 5...Since you have to use the already existing currency of crystals and coins to buy the chests, for example, it will take an estimate of Â£600 to Â£700 just to get a set of cards for frontline champions to level 3!",0
719,School of Dragons,2014.0,"Перед нами уникальный для Российского рынка продукт - игра, рассчитанная в первую очередь на детей. Её нельзя оценивать как f2p или MMO. Перед нами ""песочница"", рассчитанная на детей от 8 до 12 лет. Здесь их ждёт:  Раскрученная вселенная мультфильма ""Как приручить дракона"" и его персонажи;  Большое количество развивающих заданий, поданых в игровой форме;  Игровой мир без насилия в принципе;  Большое количество познавательных материалов на сайте игры.И  список далеко не полный. Кому интересно - в Руководствах после 20.12.2014г. должна появится моя статья об этой игре под названием ""Почему эта игра может подойти Вашему ребёнку"".При этом да, имеются определённые проблемы. Они описаны в другой статье тоже подробно. Но суть не в проблемах - у любой игры они есть. И постепенно они решаются. А эта игра - кроссплатформенная, т.е. разработчики вынуждены следить постоянно за вариациями для всех платформ. ПК на данным момент у них не самая приоритетная и их можно понять - у их целевой аудитории (детей) большая часть времени проходит со смартфоном в руках и севшая батарейка воспринимается почти трагедией.Эта игра выделяется среди большинства доступных в Steam игр именно тем, что она не пытается взять максимально обширную аудиторию, а нацелена исключительно на детей. Если Вы присматриваете игру своему ребёнку - мой Вам совет, попробуйте обратить внимания на эту.-----------------------------------------------Before us is a unique product for the Russian market - a game designed primarily for children. It can not be assessed as f2p or MMO. Before us ""sandbox"", designed for children aged 8 to 12 years. Here they were waiting for:  Hyped Universe animated film ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and its characters;  A large number of developmental tasks, filed in the form of a game;  The game world without violence, in principle;  A large number of informative material on the website of the game.And the list is far from complete. Who cares - a guide after 20.12.2014g. should appear my article about this game called "" Why this game can go to your child [steamcommunity.com]"".In this case, yes, there are some problems. They are described in detail also another article. But is not the problem - any game they are. And gradually they are solved. And this game - a cross-platform, that is, developers are forced to constantly monitor variations for all platforms. PC at this moment they have not the priority and they can understand - in their target audience (children) most of the time is spent with a smartphone in the hands and stranded battery perceived almost a tragedy.This game stands out among the most affordable in the Steam games is the fact that it does not try to take the maximum wide audience, and focus exclusively on children. If you look after your child play - my advice to you, try to pay attention to this.",1
10311,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2014.0,"Too blocky and slow, doesn't play fluently and character design is limited. lags at high graphics and everything is in a gross haze. Not enough movie reference, characters are robotic, and looks poop. I would rather play Runescape than this.",0
1169,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst of all, I just want to say that everyone you see below me is right and totally and absolutely correct.This game has gone so far south, that it has managed to encompasses the globe enough times to reverse the earth rotation from its normal gravitational orbit of east to west, and changed the course to north and south, thereby effectively causing global warming.Okay but seriously though, this game is so terrible, that I cannot literally even begin to describe how bad this game has turned out to be, without literally repeating what has already been said. If you have not yet taken everyone else’s word for it, then PLEASE at least take mine.I started playing this game last year and to be honest, it was a HECK of a lot of fun. And all the things that people are talking about with play to win was… Well… Frankly not there. And it was great. Skins for your soldiers and extra gun slots or commander perks; all that was just as micro transactions were meant to be…  Well… Simple pay if you wanted, because you had the cash. And as far as leveling up went, it was just like any other regular fps such as Call of Duty or Battlefield online; easy, simple, and yes there was some grinding involved, but it was never too far out of reach and unobtainable to the point that it was game breaking.  It was just play for fun leveling upBut now?Oh yes; all the rumors are true.They totally and completely and absolutely botched the system where now, 100 points per kill is DEFINITELY NOT going to cut it anymore to where; just like in the old days; you were leveling up at 100 xp per kill and slashing though ranks like a boss. You would watch your character go from private to major within a matter of no time. And best part about it was, it didn’t feel like a chore. There was no major grinding that was needed. All you had to do was play a few casual games and BOOM… There ya go. Wham, bam, thank you ma’am and your ribbons were all caught up, your guys was as previously stated, a major just within a few hours or so of game play, and it was fantazmastic.Now it’s more like you have to put in 100 hours (not xp) per WEEK JUST to be able to level up. And I get it game developers, I totally get and understand that you don’t want your game to be SO super easy, that everyone gets all the ribbons and rewards and achievements within a matter of days. Because if your game WAS that easy, it would be where people could finish in a matter of weeks and leave your game, then nobody would play anymore. So I totally get and understand where you are coming from on that. But to make the game so mind numbingly hard and grinding that JUST for me to even get to the next rank, I would either have to shell out my soul for the cost of a “premium account” (and again, I get it, you are a small developer so you need money) or have to put in so many hours of work that I would never have to see the light of day again, is pretty ridiculous.So hopefully, if the game developers read this, then PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE I am BEGGING YOU (as well as many of us others) just go back to the way it was. There is NOTHING wrong with changing little things about a game (like maybe adding extra guns or doing the paid subscription/gold to make money) but it should never have come to this. So hopefully, you guys will listen to us, and actually hear us out on what we have to say as players.Thank you for your time of reading, and sorry that it was so long if you felt like I wasted your time.

4043,Star Trek Online,2016.0,"One of the best character creation systems out there for an MMO. Your ship can also be visually customized, albeit to a more limited degree than your character.You can customize your bridge officers in the same manner as your main character.The PvP aspect of the game has died down a lot over the years, so if you love PvP you'll might want to check elsewhere.Ground combat can be clunky most of the time, the missions get repetitive and follow; Space Combat, Space Combat, Ground Combat and SPace Combat. Very rarely does it migrate from this grind type.The game is a grind for end game, for all of you fanatics that love specialized loadouts to kill a certain type of enemy.Plenty of weapons to choose from for both ground and space.There are some ships that are carriers with a small amount of hangar bays.It has a lot of things that Star Wars:The Old Republic seriously lacks.It's a great game for Star Trek fans, this game follows the normal timeline with some excursions to other parts of time, or other universes.The community has some elitists but for the most part let you be.

The crafts system, the biomes, the gameplay and game ambiance, and even the magic chemical reactions (alakazam, which coal becomes diamond!

17068,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal Card Game Review - Raymond KTSummary: Six-guns and sorcery collide in Eternal, the new strategy card game of unlimited choices and unbelievable fun. Eternal brings AAA pace and polish to the the infinite possibilities of a deep strategy card game. The only limits are your own creativityWith spells and swords, six-guns and subterfuge, heroes collide in the struggle for the Eternal Throne. Where will you stand? Join the battle in Eternal, the new strategy card game of unlimited choices and unbelievable fun.Variance. A lot of people will say ""variance is in all card games, it's part of the game"", and I will agree with them. However, when playing Eternal in any of its formats, there are far too many ""non-games"" - games where you have drawn too many sigils (lands), or too few, or are missing a colour entirely; games where you have drawn poorly and/or the opponent has drawn perfectly; games that are not really games, because either you, or your opponent, did not really participate.Eternal is very much a 'value' game rather than a 'combo' game, 2-for-1'ing your opponent is always what you play to, and often what you lose to. While out-valuing your opponent can be fun, often a single 'out-value' moment can snowball into victory. Why? Deck size requirements are too high (45 for sealed, 75 for draft), you can only mulligan once, and games are a 'best of 1', which means that consistency is regularly quite low. With this, even the best decks can easily lose repeatedly to lower tier decks, even if the match-up is favourable.Also, this issue of variance practically doubles in draft. The limited format is decent, and the card design makes it clear that MtG professionals have assisted with creating the set. However, the drafting stage takes place with AI bots (draft with bots, play against live players), and the AI often make strange choices that lead into odd drafting signals. Packs also have extremely poor variance, often only containing one card of a particular colour. Due to this, it's quite often that you will be passed a pack where there are literally no good picks for your colour(s) (even at pick 2), and even pack-1-pick-1 can be extremely poor. These issues exacerbate the previously mentioned variance issues, often leading to a bad draft experience. ",0

200,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is basically magic: the gathering given the Hearthstone UI treatment and legendaries that break the game.Downside is that probably 80% of my games have those 1-in-a-million power draw rates. Like getting 10 sigils in the top 15 cards, or getting 2 sigils in the top 20 cards. Things that should happen occasionally, but should not be happening with anywhere near the regularity that they do. It's probably the number one thing that kills my enjoyment of the game.The game's free to play model is pretty generous, but you will be absolutely destroyed by certain legendary cards that are so rare the only effective means of obtaining them is buying the large boxes that guarantee their drop rates.Is it worth it? I don't know. It's definitely got deeper strategy than hearthstone, but keeps hearthstone's problem of 1 card making or breaking a game if you lack immediate removal. It's also much harder to narrow down a strategy like you can in Magic thanks to the high power and high card limit requirements.",0
10042,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,"The game is very fun and a good time waster, although, it's becoming more like it's bigger brother, in other words it's evolving into a pay to win game, or should I say devolving. It's quite obvious that wargaming wants your money, nearly all game developers wants money, but it shouldn't be this extreme (I know it's not that extreme but as of the looks of it it will become VERY extreem indeed). The game also needs alot, and I mean alot of work on the matchmaking. The tiers are very good indeed but when it comes to tank types it needs heavy work. It's not fun coming in a game with only lights on your team and the enemy is only heavys and tds for example. As of right now the game is recommendable at a debateable level, but if it keeps becoming more pay to win, I'll unfortunatley not recommend it. Don't go the british heavy line lol  ",1
20374,War Thunder,2018.0,After my play time on this game i cant recommend it unless you are ready for big grind i stoped playing because a few thing first was the not so working APDS (Armored piercing discarting sabot) this is basically nedle shot at hight velocity created to penetrate sloped armor after penetration the pressure killed everything inside in war thunder you need to be precise as surgeon and hope in RNG that the enemy ammo that you hit directly explodes (90% of time that does not happen) and if that happens you die in one hit to ammo for explosive ammo. Second Gajins buffing / nerfing ammo where some tanks (mainly russian) get its penetration boosted other tank (mainly alied) get their nerfed (Challengers 2 ammo L23 in war thunder has 10m/415mm and 2000m/385 in real life it shoud have been 10m/480mm and 2000m/435mm). Thirth: the prices for repair of some vehicles are crazy i pay 20k for propeller plane and for jet only 7k. Forth is the crazy grind where you need to play crazy amout of battles to unlock later tier vehicles for some even about 4000 battles unlock single vehicle (counting that you win most of the battles) after the year i have played this game it coud be seen the progress becoming slower and slower.Edit: Remember the most people play tanks battle on ultra low find on google: war thunder low graphics exploit.,0

2419,DCS World Steam Edition,2016.0,"This is a game that needs time to learn.Time to learn how to keybind, time to learn how to start up an aircraft, time to learn how to target enemies, time to learn how to destroy them, time to learn how to use countermeasures, time to learn how to land. Then once you know those, you need time to learn how to fly at night with night vision goggles (on some aircraft).You can be happy with the game without the need of a flightstick, IR, or pedals. They do add more to the enjoyment, but if you can only use a controller, this game still works with you.If you dont like learning how planes/ helicopters work, I dont recommend this for you. If you take the time to learn it, you will be rewarded with explosions and burning carcasses that were once your enemies.Take the time to learn the free SU-25T and you will see how fun it is to kill ground targets. That is just a taste of how fun DCS can be.",1
15018,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"This is a fun low-maintenance game that does a good job of using the Fallout world, giving you missions to collect loot and makes good use of the SPECIAL stats system.Main criticism is the UI which is ported from touch screen and it can cause some annoyance when trying to select a particular character as you can easily miss. Also, it's too easy to inadvertently pick someone hidden behind a wall when you move the screen around. I haven't spent a penny of real money on this and I'm up to something like 140 dwellers. Each time I log in I usually have a new dweller waiting to join my vault. In fact, I have so many of the little guys in there it's getting hard to juggle them around properly.Some tips: Training dwellers by assigning them to training rooms where a particular stat is improved is essential to getting the vault working efficiently. After they have improved a stat assign them to the corresponding work room so they can level up. Having high level characters and arming them all is the best way to give your characters a good chance of surviving vault attacks and having success on missions. The only reason to spend money is if you're REALLY impatient, but it would be poor value so I don't recommend doing that.",1

622,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewPros:- The game runs smoothly.- The cards are generally easy to read when playing.- I never felt pressured to spend real money on the game.- There are some fun card mechanics that could only work on a digital game.- Competent, if unexciting, flavor and story.Cons:- The game is not very complex. Most games I played were both sides just building up creatures until someone topdecked a good card. I didn't really encounter any win conditions or playstyles other than ""turtle until you can play a big creature"" or ""swing with one or two smaller flying creatures over and over again.""- The individual colors don't have much of a set identity. As a result, most games feel pretty samey regardless of the colors used.- There isn't a very big card pool, so there's a lot of mirror-matching (games between two very similar decks) and repetative gameplay.- The ""Nighttime"" mechanic isn't well explained or developed.- Finding things can be difficult, as the menu system isn't immediately obvious.- While the basics of the game are explained well, certain mechanics and gamemodes are pretty much left for the players to figure out by themselves.- When drafting, the cards are very small. The cards with a full paragraph of text are difficult to read.- The western theme comes across much less than the intro would imply, and is generally extremely underdeveloped.- Each creature has a quote that plays everytime the card is cast. They get repetative and annoying almost immediately.- Energy screw and energy flood are a big issue. Games where one or both players can't play anything are never fun. Only being able to mulligan once is a glaring mistake.",0

16937,Fishing Planet,2017.0,"Ok3rd day playing.Yes, it is free. Like MANY GAMES the cash incentive is just a SHORTCUT. It's not "" You must do X to win"" like so many terribly orchestrated reviews seem to implyThe game NEEDS a tutorial that ACTUALLY teaches you. That 1st day is a MOTHER. Why is my rod red? Why does it say I do not have a rod? Why can;t I fish? what order? SO MANY QUESTIONS on day 1.....that you have to go online to ask or watch. YOU CAN FISH OR CHAT...You cannot do both :) So asking in the rooms, while fishing, tends to be not terribly productive.That said, there are nuances to this game that require taking time to  learn or ACTUALLY knowing how to sport fish...which kind of blew my mind. Once i realized it was parallel to sport fishing IRL, I was off like a shot. Lvl 16 today and pressing on.RESEARCH before you buy a SINGLE pole or reel. Want to jig/spoon/crank fish? Research...Levels are for opening gear. No point in buying a 10lb drag reel for a rod that has a line weight allowance of 6lb, with 10lb test and a 1/8oz spoon...won't work. The same standardized math used to calculate acceptable gear IRL is used in this game.EVEN if you buy a DLC pack, you STILL will be lost until you learn the basics of gear combination, use and incompatibility.If you care to take an hour to learn the basics, then another to learn the differences, uses and application of reel type A over B...and rods...Then the games for youit is not like the old Nintendo games. It is far more complex, which is why it is so popular with those who support it.Look at all of the thumbs downs. EVERY SINGLE ONE was posted by someone who thinks you should be able to be the best on day 1. Take time and play. If you want to pass up some of the hurdles, make the progression faster, spend cash. But to complain about DLC costs, when it is not critical to play the game...is childish",1
3189,Paladins®,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewBroken. They keep adding new things and changing up the game drastically but they can't fix the bugs from the last 10 updates. You get disconnected in the middle of a match, keep getting disconnected while trying to reconnect, then start spectating the bot playing in your place. But you can't take control. The menu loads but the champions, events etc. don't. The interface is getting better if you're able to reach it before the game crashes. My launcher crashes without any error and that is why I bothered to write this. The developers are just trying to grab all the money from the updates that don't fix anything. I don't recommend wasting your time with this bugfest until it's fixed.",0
10434,Fishing Planet,2018.0,go fishing in reallife its way more fun thatn this game sure it costs more but your getting something off it like catching dinner or getting better with knowledge about lures overall its a fun learning experience but this game is just a cash grab. way back in the day you could change the hometown in the game now you cant anymore cause the get you to pay more that way. i mean you gotta have like the best net and fish for the most expensive fish to make any profit at all so overall its just gets old after a while and you pretty much fall asleep playing it. made it to the end ? you deserve better go fishing in reallife or at least watch a yt video about it. have fun :P!,0
14662,Black Squad,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewSuch a fun game. I like to just come on here to relax and kill, it gives a nice break from super competitive games such as csgo and overwatch. Although saying that i wish there was competitive gamemode that u didnt have to have a clan or join a clan match to play. Something like the csgo competitive matchmaking would be great. Overall 8/10 because usually games like these are pay to play/win whereas i was suprised that spending no money can still make you one of the best in the game.",1

11743,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access Review>Edit 3 BeginJust logged in and noticed you are STILL only allowed ONE character per account, meaning you need multiple accounts if you want multiple characters without deleting any. They also still only have TWO servers available out of the TEN that they show in the server select menu.Just as i expected, they STILL didn't finish off Ashfall.They also force you to go through their NEW tutorial, which explains why you can just respawn after dying.Can now Preview Travel Forms so that's nice.After getting through Greenguard and being sent off to the next area by Artix's self inserted character (named Artix) the tutorial treats you like a baby that can't walk in a strait line. ""Go five feet forward to this marker! Good, now go five MORE feet forward to THIS marker!"" Eventually it's like ""OK! Now walk 15 feet to this marker you can not see at all!"" and i can't help but imagine the amount of people playing this game that got lost at that point due to it not being five feet in front of them and clearly visible so they had to resort to spamming ""WHERE DO I GO?!?!"".New classes that weren't there when i left, sucks how you have to do daily quests to get the tokens for them, but at least they give you a couple when you finish their Class Quests. I would honestly prefer them just giving you the class when you finish the Class Quests, but they needed a reason to convince us to waste our money on their self-insert fanfiction so we are stuck with how things are.And apparently you can't even get the NECROMANCER and PALADIN classes without BUYING THEM at this moment! Yet another way AE is trying to scam us out of our money!>Edit 3 EndEdit 2: Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?“We are planning the live release of AdventureQuest 3D on Steam, Android, and Apple iOS in Summer of 2018.”♥♥♥♥♥ it's almost Halloween, AND YOU ARE STILL IN EARLY ACCESS! Anyways im about to download the game and check if they finally decided to stop being lazy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and actually finish Ashfall for real.Edit 1: Recently discovered a boss called ""The Wall of Pain"" which has an eye that can heal it, an eye that can attack multiple people at once, and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of traps (which some can be killed, but they respawn too fast to be worth it). The worst part is, if you kill the healing eye it just comes back and heals the wall to full faster than you can kill it. So if you don't have a full team of OP tryhards don't even try.Cons:-Took way too long for them to fix a game breaking bug,-Too many Spelling/Gramatical errors (Both in-game and on the official site)-Game is just the devs self-insert fanfiction-They still haven't given Guardians enough of what was promised (basically just giving them more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cosmetics)-The title under your characters name goes right over your head if not zoomed in enough which looks terrible-When joining any server there are no specific servers for different regions, meaning you have people speaking several different languages in the same server and you have to ignore those people-Still capped at lvl20-They decided to make it Cross Platform with phones of all things, which highly limits what they are able to add to the gamePros:+Game is freeSo would i recommend this game? Nope! But if you do decide to play this game anyways, don't spend money on it. The devs don't deserve it.Seriously though, are they just too lazy to proof-read?",0

15923,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,"a non-professional game, with lots of unfair competitions, and a game easily misused, Hacked, Cheated, and the devs of the game are ignorant to that fact (they are aware of the issue but do not apply permanent solution that would assure terminating all hack users), but hey what more to expect from an andriod game.want an example of how hacks work? sure:just finished a game when i should have totally won, 3 M.O.A.B. (one of the most developed bloons you can send to your enemy to make sure they lose) totally passed into the face of my opponent and did not touch nor reduce his HP (when normally only ONE of those should eat out your enemy's entire HP), and ofc i gave it all to make this happen, n when it failed, when it shouldnt, i lost, he didnt even have anything in their hitting range, so its impossible that they were destroyed right before they arrived.this was NOT the only time this happened, and everyother time it happened, i thought maybe i missed something, but now im definitly sure that this game is bugged n hacked easily, and that is never good for competitive play.after knowing how breakable this game is, you still want to know how competitive it can be?well, i believe you know the andriod/facebook game called 8 Ball Pool, it is exactly like that, and for those who do not know it, you put 50, they put 50, and the winner gets 100 (all what was put in) but infact the winner only secured their 50, and took away the 50 of the other player.now imagine when you go on a high bet, and you find out that your enemy is a hack user at the end of the game right after they ran away with all your money, when they should have totally lost the game, and ALL YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT, is to report them? but you are not getting anything back.

2517,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWhere do I even start with this game? The scenery is beautiful, the combat feels great, and it has been super easy to get into. I didn't mind back in wow when you had to walk to a dungeon entrance with your newly formed party just to beat down a few bosses for some extra fun, nor do i in this game. the guild system is even fully fleshed out for an early access mmo. the voices aren't the most amazing thing ever in the cutscenes, nor for the quest text, but lets be honest... who here isn't cranking their favorite playlist up to 11 and just getting lost in the game itself. It seems like an API update would be a logical step after fixing some of the issues people are having with the game, however, I haven't had any sort of issue running the game at all. At this point, I think people are hating just to hate. It's like someone went on twitch or youtube and blasted the game then every other content creator followed suit just to make a quick buck. And don't get me started on people complaining about the eng game! People were willing to wait for 2+ months after other MMO releases to get end game content... what makes this game any different? I understand this is what, the 4th launch, and there were failures in the past, but this is a very cookie cutter mmo and presents itself in that way. people must have been expecting some sort of revolutionary hybrid between man/magic/and a contract with the devil behind the developement to make it out to be less than everything they thought it would be. The truth is, I enjoy the game a lot and haven't had any problems  so far. In fact, I had to pry myself away from the game so that I could get some sleep before work because I was actually having fun!

11607,War Thunder,2017.0,"This game has serious balance issues. If you're playing mid battle ranked german ground forces, get ready to be horribly disappointed. Late WW2 german armor is forced to face cold war era vehicles, in all ground forces game modes. Map position of cap zones don't factor at all the fact that almost all allied vehicles are far faster than axis vehicles, and will almost always capture points first. There's also a heavy pay to win with premium camoflague options that almost guarantee you the drop in every encounter. For both air and ground, since i've begun playing i've noticed a bias for russian vehicles. it's even been noted in previous patches that unfair and unrealistic buffs have been given to team russia. this game fills a niche for me that no other game can, but unless all nations can get a fighting chance at the win, it becomes less and less enjoyable.Presently, recommending this game to a friend is like telling them to get cancer so you're not the only one who has it.",0

3525,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI have mixed feelings about this game. The gameplay feels a bit off due to weapons inbalance and overtuned movement abilities. Melee weapons feel just as bad as other battle royale games. While a class system in a royale game is nice touch, I feel classes don't provide enough difference between themselves at the current state of the game, would be nice if they would add/change unique abilities that are exclusive to just 1 class.Something I really like about this is game the forging system which require kills to upgrade gear, which promotes more active gameplay. I feel like the knock out system in this game is unique however needs a bit of work (chicken hunt around town). Another thing that feels odd about this game are chest drop, the loot feel underpowered and cheap. A feature which makes this game stand out for me is the mount feature, which allows the player to easily go from town to town into the next battle.",0

So, I decided to search around and I found this game.It's fun as hell.I've gotten to lvl 21 in the timespan of five hours. Very fun times.The quests are the usual 'Search for X and give it to Y' or 'Kill X amount of Y', but I honestly don't mind that. To me, those kinds of things don't bug me much. The storyline is the major portion of the game for me. And, from what I've seen so far, this storyline isn't half bad. The Eidolons are pretty kickass too.The classes are unique and cool in their different ways - you have no idea how much I struggled to find the proper one that I really wanted to use. They all have different strengths and weaknesses and they provide the players with different playing styles a chance to succeed as well.TL;DR - A pretty good MMORPG that I would recommend to my friends.

1573,Infestation: The New Z,2016.0,"Okay so first off I owned the game back in the day before its name change and eventual shutdown. I can honestly say that this free to play version is just as good if not better than the original game. Yes there are bugs, yes there are hackers (they are getting banned more frequently than people think), but you have to remember that it also is under new management and has just recently been released. There are tons of items all across the map (some places seem too have way too many). If you are looking for a game similar to H1Z1 (I own that too); this is it. I mean you cant really get any better than free to play. Everything can be found/bought in game without spending real money. Now if you want special skins and that sort of thing you can either find them or buy them with real money but thats about it. The only real complaints I have is that you are bright green when you spawn in and extremely visible to other players around you, and the game crashes every now and then.

3058,SMITE®,2018.0,"Smite is probably the best MOBA out there. Whilst LoL and DOTA focus on a birds-eye perspective, Smite gets right into the action in third person, skill shot based gameplay. Using mythical deities from global pantheons such as the ancient Greeks, the ravenous Mayans or even the newest pantheons being Voodoo, Slavic and Polynesian, there is a character that represents apart of almost every single corner in the world. With almost 100 mostly different characters to choose from, there is something for everyone. Whilst, not every release can be as unique as Ganesha or The Morrigan (especially with the latest Chernebog being unpopular in the community) the game has endless combinations of team comps and thus provides a lot of fun. Especially with a two-week update rotation, there is constantly something being added, whether a new god or game mode or much needed balance. Balance is not the best in smite, its arguably one of its weak points. The meta is constantly changing and for new players, it may be difficult to get into the competetive scene. Yet with constant updates, this isn't always a problem. Monetization is strictly cosmetics. Loot boxes are a thing, however, the recent and fairly priced daily bundles, give you random exclusive skins for around $10. You can also earn premium currency in game for logging in daily or gem storm events. One issue, however, is there are constantly events back to back, giving no rest to a collector. Limited skins pop up left and right and it does get tiring seeing your favorite character get a new limited skin but not being able to purchase it due to spending your money on the last limited skin a week ago. There is a lot of free items given out however, you can get free items for winning games and leveling up will earn you previously exclusive items.The esports side is professionally handled and enjoyable to watch. With all its faults, Smite is a really good MOBA that I'd suggest everyone try. While it can be frustrating at times, Hi-Rez usually always comes through and responds to its community. Toxicity is a problem in any game and smite is no different, but ignoring negative players through the mute button is as easy as a click, and the newly added commendation system encourages positivity. Overall, smite is enjoyable and provides something for everyone. Despite its few issues in balancing and player toxicity, pass that is a game worthwhile.",1

Its concept was good, its execution wellllll.... a decent amount are doing what theyre suppose to, creating stop points along roads and objectives where enemies will have to destroy the hive before moving on to the actual objective, providing a decent enough obsticle to prevent enemy movement, a good portion abuse the maps ""out of bound"" system on the map and basicly build a wall along one side of the base, and the out of bounds on the other, creating a small makeshift outpost that can provide a respawn way far back in enemy lines where no one will even spot it because of its out of the way location... These problems are I can easily get past with a good team, but a more recent problem has started up.... cheatersPlanetside 2 uses the wonderfull ""Battleye anti cheat system"" that is used by battlefield, unturned, and a multiple of other games, providing a pretty decent defense against hackers and cheaters, that is unless you allow a loophole to form, which planetside 2 did.Long story short.

Where I'm at at the moment you make about 1/5,000,000th of what you need to buy the next character (with a number of bonuses, not exagerating, been at this point for more than a week). Furthermore, the math in this game makes no sense, if you have a character get say a 500% increace in their attack, it will increase more than 5X their original attack damage, but nowhere near 5X the attack danage they currently have...I'm not sure what sort of numbers they're basing the attack bonuses off of, but none of it seems to make any sense.

10765,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"Game had a very rough 2017 up to this point with really poorly designed sets released that powercreeped everything and completely ruined the game with sheer power of going first. But things are looking better now after the previous set, WD, was almost completely nerfed and the developer set a new direction for the future. This latest set is alright but there are still few remaining outragous mechanics in the game that are not nerfed yet and make the game less fun than it can be and favor going first by a lot. Notably storm mechanic in sword class, they printed even more storm followers this set so that if the player playing this aggro sword deck and go first, they are highly favored to beat anything in 5 turns without much the opponent can do but while going second the deck is not that good. This variance makes the game feel coin flippy and frustrating knowing that you probably lost as soon as the match starts.The other long running problem is Dshift rune decks that used to be slow so it was acceptable but they are far too fast now and beat anything except the most aggressive decks no mattter what in 8 turns so much that not only control but midrange decks now lose to it. I feel it's time to finally nerf that card  too or add some counterplay to it such as discarding hand or increasing the cost of cards in your opponent's hand. SImilarly dshift deck going first means that they can answer any follower with their numbers of removals that reduce the cost of dshift and result in your loss. While going second they will often take damage before they can remove the threats.If they address these two concerns in the upcoming monthly balance changes I feel the game is in a good spot and right now it's mostly balanced with many decks viable.",1
6896,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"This game is extremly close to Hearthstone but somewhat worse, ""synergies"" are more important than stats according to them but they give aggro an Edge over other control decks to the point, that in ladder, every aggro deck is the exact same deck with red as a base, and every control deck is exactly the same with green/purple. You will face the same two overpowered decks over and over and you will get sick of them because the game match you with people of the same level/rank as you... and when you hit level 20 they will have the complete netdeck and you will face almost no variance. The good thing is that ""starter packs"" you buy with real money offer a lot of value but right now there are better more generous games like Gwent that offer a different experience than hearthstone and might I say it, where you won't need to spend money if you don't want to.The developers tend to listen to the community to an overextent where if the comunity asks for nerfs, they will nerf the cards even if they consider them to be balanced. This is really good/bad because yeah, they will change the cards, but they won't test any changes making changes either a nerf to oblivion or stupidly unimportant.If you like Hearthstone and want to try another extremly similar game, you will love this game. If you also like aggro vs aggro matches, this is probably the game for you. If you like getting ahead fast and hitting top players fast, this game is for you as not that many people are playing and it's somewhat easy to rank up using only a couple of decks and  If you like small variance in decks, and a meta with little variance this is the game for you.If you like deckbuilding, I would not recommend this game. If you like control games, I would not recommend this game, and if you like generous card games I would go to either Gwent or Shadowverse, both of them excel where this game is left behind.",0

3268,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,"Heroes & Generals had potential, but had to mess it up with greed and apathy. This game had so much potential to be a good game, in fact it was a good game before these updates messed up EVERYTHING. The updates ruined the German faction to the point that any game with the Germans is a near certain loss, they don't listen to community requests and go on their own to buff things making them OP or nerfing the hell out of items whcih devalues the time put in that endless grind to get any item in this game. It took around the 60 hour mark to actually get a bare sniper rifle for my infantry which needs an extra 30 hours to get the essential attachments to be any use in matches. Moving to gameplay, it used to be pretty fun with games having an even match that last a considerable amount of time compared to the current match stomps, where you only see paratroopers and people sneaking past the lines to steal the obj while the other team goes for their base. I have seen countless times where our or the enemy team, after a long battle capturing the objective, getting their point capture by those paratroopers that drop in every minute right before the point was secured. Moving past that, infantry destroys tanks which makes them obsolete, there's barely any reason to play recon since everything is speeden up from the constant stream of crappy updates, and they ban many people who hadn't even done anything, there's too much to list and it makes this game incredibly boring as well as tilting. I can't find any reason why you would play this game in it's current state unless you want to waste time or money (which I might add is completely pay-to-win since the most OP weapons are sitting on top of a hefty grind or a pretty penny).

814,Star Trek Online,2015.0,"I love Star Trek. I always have, and I'm pretty sure I always will. I loved this game for a long time, too.What I'm not a fan of, is the way things on this have turned recently within STO. The atmosphere of the game is wrong. When I first started playing, it was a happy, very lore-friendly place filed with lots of people trying to get their way into the TV screen we all watched our first episodes on. Recently, the lay of the land has become confusing. To say you have to grind a lot is the understatement of the milenium. EVERYTHING is a grind now, unless you want to pay for it. It has also become increasingly apparent that PWE is searching for money: In-game purchases are fine, but when you give us 3 new ships and 10 new costumes every other week, it gets ridiculous. I think one of the things I have been experiencing serves as a perfect explination. The game only launches on safe mode. In the time that this bug began to now, I count at least 19 new ships that have been added to the game (not including fleet model ships). The new way of grinding is... well, bad. Horrendous. An abomination. A lot of the new grinds require vast sums of dilithium, which is hard to farm for, and is quantity capped at 8000 units a day, which is a penny in the well of what you'll actually need. Now, dilitium is hard to farm for, but guess what PWE sells. Zen. Guess what you can by dilithium for, kiddies. Zen. All in all, this game is very good. I wouldn't have spent so much time on it otherwise, but I'm terrified that this will turn into Guitar Hero. A good game, a great idea, but driven into the ground harder than a Mack truck hitting a freight train because they produced too much new content too fast, and people got sick of it. Also: when you advertise an upgrade to your existing tier 5 ships to make them ""tier 5u"" ships, make them equal to the tier 6 ships. The imbalance is ridiculous. I have top-tier gear on my odyssey (including your $5 upgrade). It can't keep pace with anything on tier 6, and thats not okay.

No.Just went into 10 random plays and all 10 opponents were either Founder or P2W players.While there is an occasional new player such as myself, these games promote too much P2W atmosphere.No offense to Bathesda, but this has already been done a dozen times before you came into the genre.Aside from maybe Hearthstone, because Blizzard fans are all pleebs and sheep, these games die from boredom due to P2W mechanics.

Stuff is incomplete but the bugs are mostly minor and haven't affected gameplay as much.That being said, main issue early on is leveling. Tutorial does a decent job bringing you up to speed at getting you to level 2. However, the first person you meet out of the tutorial gives you a quest involving level 6+ enemies so it's kind of frustrating to an extent and leveling isn't super easy in this game.Plays very well otherwise and I'm looking forward to more.",1
8466,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"I'm updating this review:While I still don't recommend playing this game due to negligence on the developer's part, I believe it's still a good game in one way or another. The matchmaking is still putrid garbage and the idea that people who play in less active regions get 'auto sorted' into Virginia with a latency of 100+ ping is an absolute joke. There is no reason for this other than to shorten queue times, and I'd honestly prefer waiting a few minutes more for a good server because 5 minutes of waiting time don't kill my mood as much as lag.Outside of that, the same problems still persist that got me to downvote TF2 to begin with: Balance patches take far too long to hit and exclusively get shipped with major updates that take around 4 months to hit. (4 months if you're lucky. Pyro's rework almost took TWO years.)If the team gets their act together and Valve hires extra TF2 devs, the game can be a huge moneymaker and fun again at the same time, a win-win for everyone. With Overwatch on the decline and no other class-based shooter competing strongly, TF2 has an open field once again - and it's not being used because the following problems persist to turn players away:1. Premade players can pubstomp a 24 player server just by pocketing and spawncamping the enemy team. Massive demotivator for new players.2. Competitive matchmaking up to this day is still broken and for the most part a catastrophy. It's horrendous to charge people money for this.3. We still don't have official no-crit servers despite the massive division between crit-fans and nocrit-fans, which is not good. Random crits are toxic towards new players in almost every sense.Those are just a few examples of what's not going correctly, but they are massively impacting new players for the most part. ...And for the love of it, please rework the bottom tier weapons nobody has used in ages. Candy Cane, Sun on a Stick, Third Degree, Eviction Notice, Pain Train, Vitasaw, etc.Those are all potentially interesting weapons that weren't properly buffed or reworked in ages. Even worse, the Candy Cane got NERFED by making it so you can only get healthpacks from melee kills instead of general kills.",0

This is someone's job to create this game. Surely they deserve compensation for their work. Do they not? They game can easily be played without spending any cash but the whole buisness model as for any other ""Free to play"" game is for the player to buy exclusive items in the in-game store. I cannot think of any ""Free to play"" games with so many options and gametypes that doesn't have an in-game store. So ignore all of these negitive reviews about the game not being ""free enough"".

Valve has shown time and time again for the past 6 years that they could not give one single one about the community matters. Time and time again over this particular game's history, we see them not listen to the community. Honestly, this is the final straw. Nobody asked for Battle Royale, and you can be assured that nobody asked for a free-to-play game. or prime status to all.I paid for this game, and I grinded for the prime status. I cannot play any competitive games with worthy people anymore. I thought getting out of gold was hard before, how about when you can't be sure if that new account really is cheating or not? I paid 15 dollars for this game, but now anybody can get it? Sure, free-to-plays cannot get prime unless they buy the game, but since when has that stopped cheaters? Who is gonna stop the 15 year old with his Christmas money and aimwar⁤e who just aquired a new prime copy of the game? You might aswell give prime to them already because they weren't being stopped.The game plays pretty alright for 64-tick servers, I guess. It's hard to say ""the game is good, community & company are garbage"" because the game isn't even that good. Battle Royale does not fit in this game because CS:GO's combat system isn't really designed for it.

16752,Brawlhalla,2018.0,"It's fun to play if you wanna have fun with your friends, you can try and get better and there's lots of combos and reads to learn and a variety of weapons, if you happen to find a spammer then deal with it, thats probably what this game wants you to do, get better and override those blocks and you can always learn from a better player than you so there's nothing to worry about that much. The gameplay is fine, the graphics is fine, the audio is fine, there's a few bugs and sometimes there's lag that sometimes cause you to lose and this is partly what cause the one problem. Salt.One thing every competitive game have in common, but this game has more salt than you anticipate on a 2D Super Smash Bros-like game. Almost everytime you join a game whether you lose or win, you will get trash talked almost every one of them and it gets annoying at times especially when you're in a bad mood and thus possibly break something due to rage. If you just want to play it to troll the hell out of people to break some nerves into them then sure yeah, but if you don't want any salt thrown at you then don't play this game. It pisses me off sometimes due to the people trash talking at me and I wouldn't recommend this game if you're sensitive.

2222,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"I was originally going to write this game off as just another mobile microtransactions cash grab, but Bethesda has surprised me with this one. There is absolutely no reason to use their in game store, the game does a pretty good job of standing on its own two legs. The game starts with a decent enough tutorial, and there is no penalty if you want to reset your vault because the drops weren't terrific. Base building is fun and addictive, and the downtime that plagues mobile games (which is how they rope you into buying things from their store) is actually pretty acceptable, given that they throw in the Mysterious Stranger (who gives you caps if you click on him) and the Disasters, which often require your attention as you send your Dwellers to fix whatever the situation is.Quests and Objectives are nice, as they grant tangible rewards, unlike venturing into the Wasteland, which is dependent on the Explorer's Luck Stat (which is likely to be low, unless you got a good Dweller from the Lunchboxes). Even though the Wasteland's rewards are RNG dependent, they do exist, and a good haul (especially the outfits) can really bump up Vault production.I think the only real gripe I have is that the bedrooms have a nasty case of catching fire (and not in the good way) which is odd to me, considering I've stopped placing people there since I built the Radio Room. Maybe it's just my bad luck, but I'd like to find the idiot who keeps leaving lit cigarettes by the bedsheets.All in all, I fully recommend this game if you're looking for a free time sink. And like any mobile game, I also recommend staying the hell away from the in game stores. If you can do that, there is literally no reason I can think of to pass up this game.",1

The trade restriction is probably the actual worst problem with the game, but its not game breaking, for me at least.I'd say give the game a chance for at least a week, and see how you feel then.

10650,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"I love this game.Mandatory disclaimer, I've been playing this game prior to its Steam launch in open beta and on the Bethesda launcher, so I'm not new to the game.However, I have decided to stick with this game for various reasons, the main one being that it does a lot of things better gameplay wise than it's older and much bigger cousin Hearthstone. The gameplay is fantastic and demands a lot more strategy and planning, whilst reducing the RNG to much lower levels. I always felt after a game that I could pinpoint exactly where my deck choice, deckbuilding or play ultimately led to defeat or victory and hence enjoy this game a lot more competitively as there are just far fewer occasions where one big RNG swing led me to lose and often tilt for a while.The prophecy mechanic and reduction in RNG means the meta is a lot more balanced, with aggro actually not being very strong currently (again, unlike for TESLs cousin Hearthstone).Overall the meta is very balanced, with various deck archetypes being viable, which makes the game alwasy very interesting!As drawbacks I would definitely quote the aesthetics of the game. The premiums are often not very impressive compared to what we know from other games (notably Gwent is doing this very well), but the biggest thing is the gameboard, which really ought to be at the top of Bethesda's/Direwolf's priority list as it's just the same grey scroll background whether you're in the main menu or in every single game.Overall I really love this game and am looking forward to the competitive scene that will emerge and make use of the fantastic and skill-testing gameplay.",1

17790,Crush Crush,2017.0,"I love clicker games, and a clicker game based on a dating sim seemed like a good idea.  There is definitely a lot of waiting, but that's what the resets are for.Originally, I was going to recommend this game but there were a few problems that stopped me in my tracks.The first problem, is the diamonds; there is not enough to earn them.  You earn one for each stage you progress with each girl until you reach the final stage in which you get three hearts.  That seems fair at first, but there's one catch: you can only get those diamonds once.  The only other way to earn diamonds is to buy them.  Since there are a lot of ways to spend the diamonds and not enough ways to earn them, it feels a tad unfair.  Even one of the women in game, Pamu, mentions how silly spending money on this game is, and she takes away your diamonds the further you progress with her.The second and third problems are Karma & Sutra.  These characters require you to reset your game in order to advance their stages.  The reason being is because their requirements for progression involves specific number of reset boosts, which only waste your time.  Everytime you reset the game, depending on how much progress you made with the women in each ""gameplay"", assuming you get to all of them, you get a certain boost that adds up everytime you reset.  This can take forever unless you chose to cheat the game, but then it's not fun anymore.  That isn't to say that constantly resetting is fun either.The biggest problem with this game is how it runs.  This game, simple as it is, takes up most, if not all, of my computer's processing power.  I can set the settings to fastest, take away the particles, and keep it windowed in order to make it run at its most efficient.  But as soon as I wanna open any other program, it causes my computer to overheat and crash.  My computer has never crashed up until this point.  I wasn't even playing the game, and my computer crashed from overheating.  That was the final nail in the coffin.TL:DRUntil the devs find a way to optimize the game and offer more ways to earn diamonds, stay away from this game.  Play Cookie Clicker or one of the Honey games instead.",0
14990,Magic Duels,2017.0,"People are writing bad 'recent' reviews because this game will not receive any updates with new sets of cards, but don't let that throw you off. The game already has EIGHT card sets, if you count Origins, and it's FREE! It has a fun story mode, where you get to know the colors and cards from each expansion set, and 1x1 or 2x2 multiplayer. Daily quests where you earn gold, so you don't really have to spend any real money unless you can spare it, and that excitement that you get from opening a 6-card booster pack after you earn 150 coins (or 5 multiplayer wins). Of course it would be nice to continue to get updates with the new cards and all, specially since a new set of cards just came out on July 14th, but that does not make this a 'mixed' game, as recent reviews try to.

Remember even when you grind up to get the next upgrade. you get less credits because to pay for repairs to the upgrade, so the grind just gets longer and longer.It's full of questionable headshots and pre shooting, (if its hacking the devs won't do anything without proof, so do you record every match, cos I don't) the machmaking is a joke, enless you like being spawn camped by tanks so tough even your teams tanks cannot damage them.Now you can't select different types of soldier so you are stuck being spawn camped (for example you are being spawn camped you could change to being a para and drop from a plane on to the point away from the tanks, or spawn a tank and come and help, not anymore) Last game I played most of my team quit because it's just not fun anymore.

19347,Fishing Planet,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewFirstly, let me clear something up, I am not a fan of fishing in real life or in a game. However, that does not mean I have not enjoyed the good things this game has had to offer, and it was surprising that I have enjoyed the game as much as I have.Pros:-The game has a very relaxing atmosphere, beautiful environment and great gear and fish to experience in different weather, along with a satisfactory amount of locations (would like to see more though, much more)-The battles you have when you finally get a fish on the line can be pretty epic, and the disappointment when you lose one equally as epic and heartbreaking, but enjoyable none the less and a large reason of why the game can be so enjoyable.-Managing your gear setups, and having the right gear for the right fish and situation, really defines this game from a point of view of what makes this a strong game and as close to a simulation as one might imagine of a real life fishing experience in that regard.-Now (last update) you can see your friends fish as they have added the ability to see other people fishing in the same room. Yet to decide how this feature sits with me, but for now it’s been fine.-New Dynamic Fishing system, so you have to go and search out the fish, unlike before where they were static and predictably always in the same locations.-The feeling of when you catch something rare or big, such as a new personal record this can be very exciting. Sadly, these moments become less and less frequent the more you play the game, nevertheless this is something that makes you go back for more.-Helping each other out, friends and even strangers happy to help out with tips and tricks to catch certain types of fish, it is nice that people share information to help each other catch more fish more frequently.Cons:-The Grind, initially you have a reasonably decent progression, and you get new things, get new types of fish, unlock new locations and all seems to be going ok. Then as you level up to higher levels, though not the highest, more like between early and mid-levels. You realize how much of a grind you have ahead of you, just to unlock a new thing like a new area, new gear and new fish types. The grind is brutally painful.-Premium unlike some games where you can earn a premium status, this game requires real money transaction as the only way to get yourself into a premium status. Very Money driven new implementations in last update. And premium people get more game currency and xp rewards, so It makes it less grindy experience if you pay for it. And after every ingame day, the game reminds you of your status as premium or not. Just to let you know how important it is to have premium. This new feature really pisses me off.-Last update has increased the costs of things across the board, while the ratio to earnings was reduced. So the gap was increased. The game was already out of balance in this regard, now it is more so. Coupled with the fact that catching fish is more challenging now, it simply means more grind, for both pay and free players.-""Fast forward time"" while fishing now isn’t just a simple necessary feature, no they decided to try and monetise it by adding a cooldown. So when you fill your bag after a day’s fishing and need/must forward time, you can find yourself waiting around doing nothing for the cooldown to run out because they forgot that if your bag is full you shouldn’t have to wait for a stupid cooldown to go home for the night to come back the next day. And if you do pay to have premium, you don’t even skip the cooldown, you simply reduce the cool down. This feature was incredibly badly thought out and implemented and should be reverted back to how it was.-The new system of lure fishing doesn’t seem to show properly, it was supposed to be fixed, but it still only works randomly. And furthermore to this, some of the other techniques like twitching seem to be broken now, so hopefully they can fix these things. Also the Fishing Rod Physics are now bugged in latest release which also needs fixing. Don't know why they update the game with bugs as clear as this, worked fine prior to update, makes no sense why they would break it and release it broken.-Licenses last a real life day. Instead of a game day. This is so ridiculous. If you only have 30 mins to fish one night, well too bad you pay for a full license. The costs really add up and hurt, the game is not friendly to casual players. It is heavily trying to stimulate long play sessions so that you might actually get some value from your playtime. Otherwise you can find yourself losing money, because of the stacking costs of Licenses. You could basically end up in scenario where you spend 5 or more in real life days fishing just one day in the game, however you have to pay for 5 Days’ worth of Fishing license. Simply makes no sense.-If you make enough money in a day, but don't have enough before going to your trip to cover the costs of the 2nd day, yes you pay to fish in game daily in addition to licenses. The game simply boots you back home, essentially losing the benefit of being out fishing. So even if you made say 10k and have plenty of fish, the game doesn't know to use what you caught to pay for the next day, watch out for this, it is really annoying when it first happens to you. It will simply force you home, even though you made more than enough to cover the costs. The message says ""Stay ended"" your stay on the pond has ended, you don't have enough money to stay longer. But you do, the game is just so badly made, that it won't recognize it. Really infuriating.-Lack of an audio cue for when you need to strike, (as an optional feature, would be great) because it really can be rather sad at times, that I have to sit there staring at a float all day hoping for a bite. Would be nice to be able to look at something else and have an audio queue when I need to strike and reel in the fish. Visual only cue is a bit limiting of times I’m willing to play the game. As it does take a certain amount of focus, an audio cue would really allow people to do other things while not missing out on catching the fish, because they are forced to stare at the float intently.Summary:Barely Recommending this, the game has its moments and it is free (time is money so the term free is used loosely in this case), so it is worth at least giving it a chance. You can have some relaxing moments and some excitement too all in one, but I do find I have to be in a specific mood to play this and I have to allow enough time to make it worthwhile. If you are into fishing, then It would make sense that you like this game. And if you are not, give it a try, who knows you might learn something, I know I did.",0

14470,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,"I don't know if Clicker Heroes is the first game of that kind, but it certainly is my first, so I consider it as it and compare all the other games to it.If there's one thing done right there, beside the many things, is that it feels honest to you: you never feel cheated on because everything's mathematically correct.Sakura Clicker feels like a rushed game because of many reasons but the progress is certainly one of the worst. You feel like the developers just tried something to see how it goes, without putting much thinking into it.Most of the game is a copy/paste of Clicker Heroes (ascensions included) but with all of the functional changes done wrong.This ends up in upgrade cost being too high for the damage dealt, so the only good thing to do is to upgrade each ally 3 to 5 times then wait to buy the next one, and that wait means close the game and come back later. I know that happens to Clicker Heroes too, but here I mean literally play 2 minutes then idle for 5 hours or more. All the time.Since the aug 3rd update this situation got better, because the devs raised the damage a great lot, but that also proves the fact that this whole thing was just badly planned at the beginning, and it still doesn't feel right.This game suffer from many problems, and even though the devs seem to listen to the players and actually implement stuff that most people are asking, that could have be done before releasing it, and anyway we're far from something working right.It all feels like a cardboard game, with little to no animations (the only one being the enemies closing their eyes when beaten), just a few 8-bit like sound effects, and a short looping music that will get annoying very soon. The character design is nice but  it is just an excuse to attract people, because that's really the only good thing of this game.That said, those girls are just random, and there doesn't seem to be any pattern in their dressing. Bosses are just the same girls, but stronger.Your character is shown on the playfield, and you can change its appearance in a specific tab of the game. Most stuff has to be purchased with real-world money before being able to wear it (like the most sexy dresses), and that's the only thing you can purchase. The problem is that it just stand there doing nothing, so it doesn't really make sense to even be there.This game really feels like a quick cash-grab as there's nothing interesting to do while it runs beside purchasing upgrades, which, as I said, isn't really anything strategical since you just purchase the best ally and forget about the rest, so for most of the time you'll just have the game closed collecting money for you.The progress is non-existant as you can't really see any beside the small number indicating the level, because the game is always the same: random girls with a new random background every 10 levels.The worst thing about this game, though, is that you don't know where you are going.On Clicker Heroes you always have a clear objective, which isn't only to get further than your last ascension but it also gives you some clear short/mid/long range objectives to achieve and a little bonus if you manage to complete them, which are the in-game achievements. You have a reason to go further and a clear objective, and you also see an ending point to reach.In this game you don't have any. You just beat these always-the-same enemies for no reason at all, forever.Reaching further bosses has no meaning either, as they are simply another randomly-dressed girl which gives you nothing more than some coin, as all the other enemies.I see it as if this game tried to be another clicker with its own identity, but this new identity failed to be attractive and don't even work right.",0

18367,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewAn interesting and quirky experience for me. Almost the entire game involves going through one room to the next, of which there are 1000, some short and straighforward, some longer and more complex, but all being a few seconds long at most. Occasionally, you'll be chased by monsters which, despite coming in many variations, almost universally require you to simply go through rooms as fast as possible until they cease their pursuit. Very few moments require solving puzzles or obtaining keys to proceed, giving the player little reason to explore unless forced to. Because of these characteristics, the game feels like a very long chase sequence and, with 1000 rooms to be overcome before the game is over, it can get very repetitive despite being a very short game, clocking at around 3 hours for completion. Fortunately, there are save spots every 50 (later 100) rooms, which allows the player to take a break if necessary. Difficulty-wise, it's not hard; almost all the monsters can be avoided with little hassle, and it's entirely possible you'll miss several of them depending on how efficient you are at going through the rooms. However, the game leaves little room for error, as the enemies tend to deal high damage and some can even one-hit kill you if they manage to get in close enough. It all depends on how well you can manage to keep to your goal of sprinting and reaching the next door. In regards to atmosphere, it's a blend of humor/cuteness with horror, which can be verified by looking at a few screenshots. The humor consists mainly of cutesy characters and dialogue, which are peppered throughout the gameplay (but become increasingly rarer). The horror portion involves surprisingly disturbing imagery and sounds, most of them from the monsters that chase you, and I didn't find myself detracted from it by the occasional humor, so I believe the game was successful in its atmosphere. In my opinion, that is the highest point of this game - seeing what monsters, environments and dialogue will come next.All in all, if you're a fan of horror games, I'd say give this at least a try. It's different and has a charm to it that I believe adds to the overall experience and makes it quite unique.",1

Just trying to rank up is literally impossible seeing the people that actually play this game either greif, hack, or flame. And it's pretty common to start a game with a useless bot because people don't know how to manage their time. It's about 1/5 chances you will be put in a good PUG and not only that, the game is infested with hackers. Every holiday the game goes on sale for basically pocket change and hackers just ruin the game. Good luck getting in a game with people who actually have common sense. ",0
7353,Realm Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThe game is really good for an alpha. I noticed most last negative reviews are from people that don t understand what an alpha is. I'll give a more in depth review when they ll stop deploying big changes every weeks and the game enter beta.,1
19009,Black Squad,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWhile this game has a promising core, the devs are not making use of the potential it has.Let's get some pros out of the way:-Rewards are generous and get you set up quickly.-Game looks and runs well.-Pretty good visual/audio feedback on kills.-Huge arsenal of weapons.-The shop is free of pay2win gear, everything premium is cosmetic.-The core gameplay is solid and fast to pick up.Now for the cons:-Map design is horrible, Demolition is the only gamemode with servicable maps and I'm being generous here.-Weapon balance is bad, 3-4 assault rifles dominate the game with snipers following in their footsteps because of how easy they are to use. The rest are just awkward gimmicky weapons to use if you really don't care.-It has a CSGO-style crate system that is somehow worse. You need to open random boxes to get another box that you can then open with a paid key and get a random item.-Gamemodes, except for TDM and Demolition, are bland and rely on low effort gimmicks to make them unique. They're dead for a reason. TDM is a spawnkilling simulator.-Anti-cheat is a little lacking, Battleye doesn't do much on it's own.-There are absolute zero ways to communicate with your team because of no built-in VOIP and the dead cannot communicate with the alive players. Radio commands are extremely limited and often misleading, they don't mark anything either so ""Enemy Spotted"" is useless.The final nail in the coffin for me personally has to be that the devs show zero intentions to accept community feedback which means the game won't really have a chance to grow. There are a lot of issues I've mentioned that just require some updates and it'll be perfectly fine but they don't seem to be interested in this approach at all. That's Neowiz for you.The game is still playable, but I wouldn't recommend it because of this problem alone.",0

Butt it's a 2D game, how can there be any exploration ? Well , some zones ,maps, shops ,npcs , chain quests ,etc that  can only be accessed  by doing certain things , whether it is typing command, doing a quest , solving puzzles ,etc. These coupled with the main story quest line really make an otherwise 2D world really feel alive. And i just don't feel the same way about AQ3D . I really want to like this game , i've been waiting for years ....but i just can't recommend it, not at this state at least.",0

2261,Paladins®,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewHey everyone!Paladins, a game which most things you hear about are bad things. However, most of the bad things come from people that have never played paladins before. They’ve only seen someone play it. Let me just give you a brief explanation of the way paladins works: paladins is a first-person arena based hero shooter. That’s a mouth full right. Although there are a couple games that, by just looking at the genre, are exactly the same. You know which games I’m taking about. Overwatch and Team Fortress 2 (and maybe battleborn but I’m just excluding that one because that’s the least played of all of them), and to be honest, they have a lot in common.They are both shooters in which the goal is to capture an objective or escort a payload. 2 teams batteling against each other from 3-6 players (amounts differ between games). Those players each select a hero/champion/class which has different abilities. Although they share the same base, they are far from the same. I am most going to be talking about paladins compared to overwatch since nobody seems to call paladins a tf2 ripoff (which it’s not by the way). The exact goal of paladins is to capture an objective in the middle of a symmetrical map. You do that by standing on it. You’ll gain 3 percent per second for standing on the point. Once a team reaches 100% capture they get a point and spawn a friendly payload. The goal of the team that spawned the payload is to escort it all the way to the enemy base. The goal of the opposite team is to do, you guessed it, the exact opposite. They have to prevent the enemy from escorting the payload successfully. If the escorting team escorts the payload successfully they get a point. If they do not, the defending team will earn themselves a point. This process is repeated until a team reaches 4 points. Matches last from about a short 7 minutes to a long 30 minutes, depending on the skill variation between the players. I find myself match up against opponents around my skill level most of the time although the matchmaking system can still be improved. In overwatch, and I’m taking about competitive, the goal is for the attacking team to capture an objective and then escort a payload. The goal of the defending team is to prevent the attackers from completing their goal. After time is up or the attacking team has successfully escorted their payload to the very end. The teams switch sides and the process is repeated. Only the attacking team can earn points. They do that by capturing an objective and escorting a payload. The team that had the most points after the time of both teams is up, wins. Now of course these game modes seem alike, however, they play much differently. This is mostly because paladins also has a lot of aspects that a MOBA usually has.In paladins, unlike overwatch, you cannot switch character during the match. Also, if you play a hero in overwatch, and someone in the opposing team plays the same one, you play against the exact same hero with the exact same stats, damage, cooldowns etc. In paladins however, you do not. This is thanks to 3 systems. Loadouts, legendary cards and items. Loadouts are sets of cards made by the player for each champion. A loadout consist of 5 cards, each card giving a buff to one of its abilities, his weapon or his armor. Loadout cards have 4 levels, each level making the buff a little better. A loadout card at level one uses one point, cards at level 2 use 2 etc. You can have a maximum of 12 points in your loadout. At the start of a match you can choose one of the loadouts you’ve created. You can also select a legendary card, which, just like a loadout card, gives a buff to one of your abilities or your weapon. However, this is a massive buff that will change your playstyle of this champion completely. There are 3 different legendary cards for each champion. Some cards may be better in different circumstances which you’ll understand by playing the game. During the match you earn credits. Credits is a currency you can buy so called “items” with. Items are, just like loadouts and legendary cards, things that buff your champion. What makes them different from them though is the fact that items are the same for every champion. They don’t buff your ability or weapon, but they buff another stat. You can buy 4 items in every match, 1 of every category. There are 4 categories: defense, healing, utility and offense. Defense cards containing buffs like damage reduction, healing containing buffs like life steal or extra heal from teammates, utility containing buffs like reduced cooldowns or faster ultimate charge (yes just like overwatch paladins also has ultimates), and offense cards containing buffs like faster reload speed or more damage to shields or deployables. These items are level one when purchased, but can be leveled up to a maximum of level 3. Level 3 having 3 times the buff of level 1, but costing 3 times the credits as well. Credits are gained passively, which gives you about 2 credits per second (different from each game mode), but they are also gained by dealing damage, contesting or capturing a capture point, contesting and escorting the payload, dealing damage, kills, eliminations and healing your teammates. These 3 systems are what makes paladins a completely different game than overwatch. And of course they are alike. Some champions have the same abilities and stuff but that is because those are just common types of abilities in a game like this. I have played both games and I have enjoyed both a lot. I still play both overwatch and paladins regularly and love both of them. Paladins is a little buggy though since it’s early access, but you’ll get used to it. Also paladins is much friendlier to slower PCs. I have a very bad pc with intergrated graphics and no graphics card and i can run paladins at maximum settings at 60 FPS or higher. With Overwatch however, I can only reach a maximum of 20 FPS with minimum settings. This might be because paladins is a little less detailed than overwatch but blizzard can still definetely work on some optimizations.Sorry for making my review so long and maybe boring but I hope you have a good look on the difference between paladins and overwatch now, and why neither of them should be called a ripoff of one another.Thank you for reading,And yes I recommend paladins if that’s what you came here for.",1

10353,School of Dragons,2014.0,"I love this game.As someone who hates how most PC games spead the UI all over my big 1200p monitor, it's nice to have a game which makes everything big and close enough that I don't have to worry about looking at the game. I also have tons of money and hate how most games only allow me to spend it on the base game. This game has no such issue, and it's loading screens tell me about all the best things to spend my money on.RANT TIME:I HATE HOW SO MANY PC GAMES THESE DAYS HAVE ALL THESE FANCY AND CONFUSING OPTIONS MENUS!!! ALL THE MASSIVE TEXTURES FILLING UP MY HARD DRIVES!!! ALL THE AUDIO SLIDERS AND ""COLOR BLIND MODES"" WHO CARES ABOUT COLOR BLIND MODE?! I HATE IT! I HATE IT ALL, IT'S CONFUSING AND TAKES UP TOO MUCH HARD DRIVE SPACE!!!Rant overBut seriously guys, the only thing I don't like about this game is that they got the stupid voice actor from the movie and he's everywhere in the tutorial. The options menus aren't confusing (only 5 options! Yay!), the textures are small and compressed to minimize HDD space, and I can spend my money as much as I want and I'll never run out of things to buy!11/10 Would play sheep football again",0

2564,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI may not have played a large amount of the game but I feel I've played enough to give an educated opinion. I tried the game in hope of finding a sort of WW2 themed Battlefield game as it promised large scale vehicular combat. I was then saddened when I realized that the only combat I would be seeing is tiny 'skirmish' battles with civilian trucks in place of the large panzer tanks I'd hoped for. But before even reaching combat I had to tackle the loadout menus, which are utterly confusing and drastically over complicated and lets not forget the propaganda for buying premium currency. Eventually, I gave in and began to enter the skirmish battles with my  new US character. This I regret. I took up position behind a rock and began firing away at the grey-green enemies against the grey-green backdrop. I stared down the useless iron sights, which obstructed my view more than aided it and fired a round at an enemy that was closing in. Hit. However I was utterly flabbergasted when the enemy retorted with a barrage  of bullets from their machine gun. I was chopped down in a matter of seconds, questioning how I could fight these bullet spewing monsters. I continued the cycle: spawning, firing a measly few bullets before being destroyed by those blasted machine guns. The battle then boiled down to a relentless spawn killing and, needless to say, I was on the receiving end.Frustrated by my beating I navigated myself to the shop in search of my own machine gun. I then had to pick my jaw up from the floor once I saw its price tag. But rest assured, you could easily purchase it with some 'premium' currency. Against my instincts I grinded enough money to buy another american rifle - this one a bolt action as i wished to begin sniping. If the starting rifle was bad then this one must have been the worst, it traded the semi-automatic fire rate of the starting rifle for a measly damage increase and even worse iron sights. Meanwhile, I'd also  unlocked the ability to finally engage in the actual battles the game advertises. It was nothing like what I'd hoped. Instead of being able to partake in ordered offensive and defensive battles I was greeted with the barrel of some high-rank tank controlled by a guy ten times my level. And to make matters worse, if I dodged the tanks then I would surely have my brain splattered by some grey blur of a sniper on a hill at the other end of the base.And this is where I uninstall this game. To summarise; the games concept is brilliant however it is delivered so poorly I wish I'd never been tempted into downloading. I appreciate that the game is free however it is heavily unbalanced and easy to skip to the top of the leaderboard if you've got the  dough for it. Oh, and also the vehicle controls are so clunky and unresponsive you could brew a cup of tea by the time your bicycle makes a right turn, that is unless you aren't  blasted apart by any of the methods listed above. I would recommend this game to  nobody other than those who prefer  to 'buy' prestige rather than  earn it. Maybe you will  squeeze some fun out of this game but I for one will enjoy all the saved storage base this game once occupied.",0
11933,Minion Masters,2017.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is Pay To Win unfortunately. If you got real money to spend you can get the best masters and best cards and all you got to do is get a C2a deck and you are a master at this game. No other strategy to it. A patch to nerf C2a decks went live today and its still OP. This game requires a lot of balancing. I know its Early Access but all I am playing are players that use C2a decks and its really annoying. The whole game is flooded with players playing C2a decks. Very sad.,0
16174,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"*edit 06-08-2018*I've changed my Review to positive after revisiting the game again!(but for the sake of transparency I've kept the original review text.it would seem that through patching the developers have managed to make the game significantly more stable(only had a single freeze so far - where before it was constantly making the game unplayable)also with the adition of the new card releases some more interesting mechanics have been introduced.still find the presentation a bit on the dull side though.*edit 06-08-2018*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Elder Scrolls: Legendsis a fairly vanilla CCG with only a few ""new"" features that in the end doesn't  make up for the Games technical problems e.g. GAME CONSTANTLY CRASH.pros:1)Voice acting for the singleplayer campaign is solid.2) easy to learn mechanics3) ""Prophecy"" cards, one of the new things I haven't seen in other card games. basically for every 5 health you lose(starts is 30) you get to draw a card, if you draw a prophecy card you can play it for free....it's a nice littel catch up mechanic that can sometimes prevent your opponent from steam-rolling you.4) lane mechanics(singleplayer...due to technical difficulties I never got around to play vs. so don't know how it works there) the game board is split into two lanes creatures can only attack each other in those lane....in some cases lanes have special rules....fx. hidden for the first round they're in play.5) upgradeable basic cards. when you you level up your account, some of your basic cards gets upgraded and at times you can even chose an upgrade path...it's a nice touch it does mean though that match making can be a problem if you get matched with a higher level opponent, since he can have upgraded versions of your base cards. but at least for the singleplayer portion it gives a nice sense of progression.cons:1) boring presentation.2) boring card mechnics...basically not much that haven't been done before.(outside of the pophecy mechanic)3) Technical problems. the game constantly crashes for no apparent reason...considering it's a basic card game having the game constantly crash is simply unforgiveable and it's the primary reason I won't recommend this game and the reason I'm uninstalling it.",1
1771,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014.0,"It is kind of hard to say I do not like the game after > 1100 hours of gameplay. It is very addictive! What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that  makes the difference.  But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers.  I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition.  Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc.  The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time.  Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player!  Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters.  And their patience level with newcomers is about 0.  So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:)  If you can't practice in a  competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play?  Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training.  And training does pay off! Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good!Still playing daily, and still loving it!   So... recommended?  Hell yeh! NB I just have to mention that that laguage used ingame is really bad... Maybe thats just my feminine view., but I think it extremely childish and limited to the same scolding words over and over. Quite pathetic to be honest.  I  learned to ignore it.  Loving the mute button!  I just hope that it is not a reflection of those people irl. That would be really sad.

9989,Star Trek Online,2015.0,"This game plays and feels like Star Trek, the quests give a very episode feel. The space combat is amazing, you have control over your ship, its fire power and most importantly and Star Trekly (I know that isn't a word...tough) you have control over your power distribution. "" More power to aft shields""  yes you can.Really the only downside is it rarely really prompts you to group with others and the groudn combat feels alittle clunky...just a little.  Then again, lets face it, the hand to hand and ground combat in Star Trek shows looks a little clunky.  All in all this is a good MMO and a GREAT Star Trek gaming experience. I would recommend this game to any gamer who is also a Star Trek fan, to purely MMO fans...maybe not as a lot of its appeal is the Star Trek side of it, not its raw game mechanics.",1
6750,Neverwinter,2014.0,"Neverwinter is a game that has me halting between to opinions. There are some really good parts about this game, but also some not so good or just plain bad. Let's start of on a positive note.The good!:It is a really fun MMORPG with a cool and dynamic combat system that makes you dodge, run around and use your abilities without them having very long cooldowns. This, in combination with the relatively easy and straigthforward quests, makes you feel like a god amongst men. Hacking and slashing your way through clearly inferior enemies with awesome attacks and skills that are animated beatifully gives a cool kick. I don't mind the easy quests either. They'll take you to a wide variety of area's and dungeons, really making you feel like a badass adventurer. The gear in the game is absolutely beautiful, which for me is very important. It does matter a bit if you are wearing a ""set"" of armor that makes all the pieces look good together. But even when leveling up and wearing rags the gear looks very cool.The not so good:As a casual gamer myself and trying to do some endgame a few flaws in the game come to the surface. The endgame dungeons are buggy as hell. If you do not have a guild or a full party that you can run dungeons with you are bound to use the game's queuing system (which works quite well actually). More often than not you will find yourself on a long dragging dungeon attempt that is usually about trying to exploit the dungeon's bugs in order to skip as many enemies as possible with people that don't seem to care if you die or not. None of the enemies really have any cool game mechanics, they just hit harder or faster than the last guy. I havent really had any boss fights that I found intriguing. Some of them were hard, yes. But that was just due to the enemy having a ridiculous amount of hitpoint and/or hitting very hard. I have not really had any fun in endgame dungeons yet.The bad:The game is published by Perfect world which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all. The game of course is Free To Play, which means that Perfect World will have you try to spend money on it at every turn you take (or atleast that is how I feel) because they have to make money somehow. The game has two main currencies : Astral diamonds and Zen. Both of these currencies can be traded for one another. Almost all the epic gear in the game is Bind on Equip, which means that you can buy all of this gear for enormous amounts of diamonds. For people playing this game full time it is not a problem getting this gear and selling it, but for the casual gamer it can be frustrating to get to these incredible amounts of diamonds without spending any money on it. I guess this all makes perfect sense for someone who is at peace with this system and will probably go ""yeah, so what?"". For me it is really an uncool feeling. I feel that the best gear in the game should only be available for the ones who have completed certain content and have really earned it. For me this feels like Pay to Win. Combine this with the buggy endgame dungeons and the games endgame feels like a letdown.Besides that, the game makes you pay ridiculous amounts for what I call ""comfort items"". Items you do not need to complete the game but make your life ingame so much more easy. Things like a big bag (8 euro's in Zen!!) and fasts mounths (40 euro's in Zen!!) are just incredibly overpriced. These are not microtransactions but you end up paying as much for a fast mount as you would for a legal copy of Guild wars 2 during it's release. Just plain robbery. Of course you can always farm the required diamonds ingame but for a casual gamer that isn't really an option.All in all it looks like Perfect World is trying to benefit from the casual gamer with a job that has no time to play the game full time but has plenty of money to spend on it. Since I am in that categoty I feel a bit exploited by the game.My advice!:Go play Neverwinter! The combat system and the cool area's will give you much fun leveling up. The game really feels complete with cool loot drops and giving you new gear almost every level you gain.Think twice about really endgaming Neverwinter. The endgame dungeon's are buggy and hard for casuals. The game feels really repetative after spending some time at the max level.Rating:+Cool Combat system+Feel like a god amongt men+Nice area, plenty to explore+Very cool skills/attacks and animations for all characters-Everything for sale-Hard for casuals to farm enough diamonds-Feels like pay to win sometimes-Comfort items really expensive-Buggy and repetative endgameAll in all I would score this MMORPG 7 out of 10.Give it a try!",1

The one plane that I instantly fell inlove with was the A-10 Worthog. I really like this plane because you have to turn on the engines like if you would on the actual plane and thats not all. You also need to learn how to use the weapons system and radar systems just that are exactly how the plane is used in realy life!Anyways this game is a really fun game if you are into combat simulators.,1

8101,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe developer keeps breaking the game - last patch introduced a major new concept, random loot instead of earning credits to buy whatever part you want, but messed up the economy by making parts literally 10 times hard to get, in time.

4672,Dota 2,2015.0," ""Be careful not to make more enemies than the five you are already facing"" Dota 2 is an amazing free-to-play MOBA game with fascinating lore, fun hero abilities and various item mechanics to learn. Although the frequently toxic community and the painfully steep learning curve initially frustrated me, the experience of discovering new tactics and mastering new heroes in my first 1000 hours of playing the game, was immensely enjoyable and outweighs the aformentioned toxicities.Consistent updates adding/reworking new heroes, abilities or in-game mechanics as well as the beautiful cosmetics, new terrains, music packs and announcer packs makes this 5 year old game shine, even to this day. These updates encourage players to adapt to the current meta and master even more heroes, as well as to get to know currently effective strategies or skills and coordinate with the team for GG victory. (tl;dr) Dota 2 is definitely worth picking up and learning if you have the time commitment to do so, especially now more than ever as the devs have made it easier for newcomers to learn the basics of the game; accompanied by the new-and-improved matchmaking system. However, be wary that the community, regardless of which server you are in (im looking at you SEA servers) contains plenty of salty and toxic players.9/10",1
1708,PlanetSide 2,2018.0,"One of the best FPS games ever to be created.Planetside 2 is an FPS game like none other. In this game Combined Arms, Teamwork, and Individual skill come into play all at once. This game is extremely fun when you know how to play and have a good battle.But it is also very frustrating, on the Darksouls level of frustrating.""Pulling an ESF for the Exact 350 resources you have, that you waited for, just to be crashed into by an Enemy ESF"" That is probably the best example i can give you about the frustration PS2 can cause you.The game is very hard to get into. The massive battles can be quite disorienting and complex. New players think PS2 is CoD, run into a control point with 5 MAX's and 20 other players, and die instantly, then repeat that 20 times. Ragequit and uninstall. If you're a new player looking into starting to play PS2, the biggest advice i can give you is:A: Youre going to die, A LOT. I know everyone says that in every other fps, but this is the case in PS2. You might die 20 times per battle, maybe less, maybe more (probably more), while only getting the mere 10 kills. But dont be frustrated. That is planetside. Even the best of players die, ALOT. Just respawn. Or change battle.B: Open your preferred internet browser, go to youtube.com and search for a guy called ""Wrel"". He has many videos on how the game works and how to start out. Just watch some videos.C: Its okay to ragequit.  Its gonna happen alot. Just come back in an hour, or two, or the next day. Every day might not be your day. Just come back, and you will enjoy atleast some part of some battle. Even getting that 3 man killstreak as a noob is good.The best way to play PS2 is trough perciverence. It takes a lot of nerves and time and tears to get even mediocre and to understand the game, but it will all be worth it.In conclusion, Planetside 2 has a small, but friendly and resilient community. The game is a great one, but it is hard to get into.I absolutely recommend this game to anyone, anywhere. ",1
2799,theHunter Classic,2016.0,"As of the time of this writing I have about 4 hrs. in the game as a guest/free player and I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it enough to get a year subscription. Contrary to popular belief, considering a lot of the reviews I read before trying the game, it's not that difficult. I didn't have to walk for hours to find prey, heck, I found prey within 5 min. of playing and continued to find prey with practical hunting techiniques. This isn't an instantly gratifying game like other First Person Shooters. This game, like real life hunting requires a little patience and an understanding that most wild animals have better senses than people do. Therefore, you can't just run down whatever it is you are looking for and engage in combat. You have to track, stalk, lure and wait for the correct moment to take your shot. I do agree though that the membership rates and in game currency are a bit expensive. I do recommend this game but only if you kind of know what you're getting into i.e. realistic-ish hunting and slightly expensive fees. If you are looking to take down a deer in hand-to-hand combat with an RPG across your back... stay away and go with what you know.",1
20334,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2018.0,"Well, What can i say? I mean look at how many hours i have spent in this game (spoiler alert: a lot) not only that but that isnt even my total playtime since i had the game on android before i had it here so my hours here can easily double at the time of this review hell its even beaten my favorite games in playtime.Now with the actual review: IF YOU ARENT FAMILIAR WITH YUGIOH AT ALL START HERE: this game is a great starting point because its simplistic because of its format and lack of complicated mechanics, the game itself has tutorials that work more like quizes that are entirely optional and you actualy get gems(the important in game currency that will allow you to get cards faster) and i know what you are thinking.....¨gems? is this a facebook game or what?¨ and well gems can be purchased with real money so it kind of has a real conection but unlike other games they arent scarse, you basically get over 1000 when you start (at least thats what how i remember it) plus 200+ each month thanks to events wich at the same time give you more cards and more characters so i think you should give it a try because in my opinion its the easiest and cheapest way posible to start playing the game IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE ANDROID VERSION OF THE GAME START HERE: the rumors where true at least just at first the port had some bugs like the battles not starting right but that got fixed with an update, also the screen was directly ported making the window an akward rectangle almost like it was an android emulator but another recent update(at the time of the review) made the sides even better i admit they already where usefull since they displayed cards info in a bigger font and the duel history was constantly displayed  but now they also show the events and stuff  and thanks to those upgrades i can say without a doubt that the pc version is the definitive version since the andorid version takes too much space on the phone and has smaller font and in general runs wors than in pc XD. IF YOU JUST ARE FAMILIAR TO THE TCG START HERE: the game is definitely not like the current tcg at all it kind of lives in a bubble where you arent losing your game if you dont fill your board on the second turn, if i had to simplify it i would say it lives in the gx era but with better and recent cards, the basics and the essence is still the same it just that in a smaller portion and without complex summoning mechanics like synchros, xyz, pendulums and links (at least not at the time of this review) if all those special fusions where to be added i am sure they would try their best to keep the game simple, how simple you ask well simple enough that worms and ojamas are viable options (well maybe worms not so much but they do work) now one of the major diferences is character abilities each character has several abilities that can be equiped to a deck and they can go as simple as at the start of the duel using a specific field spell like Yami, or more developed like Maximillions mind reader ability which lets him see the oponents face down cards as long as he has 2000 lifepoints or more (he as in pegasus) now this may sound like it breakes the game but no, its the oposite it adds depth to it you have to consider abilities when deck building and you get rewarded by being diverse aka using a lot of diferent decks at least two for each duelist abilities also let you compensate for the  lack of cards and add fluidity to a deck kind of like master of fusion which allows you to take a polymerization card from outside of the deck when your life drops 1500 instead of doing a normal draw this type of ability allows you to turn things when you have the fusion materials at hands but you cant draw poly or hell have a fusion deck without any poly or with less then 3, posibilities are endless.",1
3846,Crush Crush,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewOkay, so I think I have enough time put into this game to write a good review about it. Crush Crush is a casual game developed by Sad Panda Studios. The game takes the format of a clicker.... but with WAIFUS! You have ""crushed"" these girls one way or another, and now to make it up to them you must grow friendships and spend a lot of money to get them to forgive and love you.Pros:-Better mechanics behind idling than many other idlers I have played. Actually obtainable and not too difficult-Characters are something to love in this game. They are cute (yes, Bearverley, I'm talking about you) and their dialogue has made me laugh quite a few times already-There is a broad spectrum to this clicker, as you need to focus on leveling up your ""hobbies"", ""jobs"" and still be able to click ""hearts"" to progress-The game is free, and it has multiple achievements, most of them with the anime-style characters. Yes.-Developers are very active with regards to support and updates. Good to know considering this game is still early-accessCons:-Progression at the moment is a bit difficult, and requires some form of microtransaction (buy diamonds) in order for you to progress faster. It is still completely possible to progress without this, it just becomes incredibly slowIf you are someone who loves themselves a good clicker, combined with beautiful waifus and a touch of humour, this is the perfect game for you.8/10",1
1157,Brawlhalla,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is great. I've been wanting a fun fighting game on PC like smash bros for awhile, and this game is pretty similar-you can even use an Xbox (or other) gamepad and it works amazingly, and you can play a friend right next to you just by handing them a controller or the mouse+keyboard. This game completely supports ""couch play"", aka playing with your friends on the same screen. I've had a sweet time during this beta and the game is fantastic, which is funny because...it's free to play...and more fun than Mortal Kombat X was on its PC launch date. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely. Get it. Play it. If you like fighting games, you'll love this one.",1

11897,Magic Duels,2016.0,"Magic Duels has traditionally been a series for the Magic dilettante. Let's face it: a lot of us enjoy playing Magic on the side once in a while, but do not really want to invest the time and money required to play competitively, either face to face with cards or on Magic Online. This brings me to the negative review. The newest iteration of Magic Duels deviates from this model and tries to imitate Blizzard's Hearthstone. This is quite the odd move from my perspective as Magic Online, the aforementioned digital incarnation of Magic, is better suited to this hardcore approach to the game. But for those of us who are interested in a casual format that offers decks with limited customization within their archetypes, there is nowhere to go. Many of us do not have the time, money, nor inclination to invest so much in this game. We just want the occassional online game with a down payment for the base game and a few expansions that cost a few dollars each.There are, of course, other negatives you can read about, many of which others have described and I don't want to spend too much time detailing. These problems largely involve a loss of features that were integral to the Duels experience, such as a functional way of playing two headed giant complete with chat and notifications about teammates who have bailed on you.",0
1833,AdventureQuest 3D,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.In a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time, rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.Beatles' ""Aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon & McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Four'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of entire operas such as ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia""; not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses.The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented ""Beatlemania"" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time reading these pages about such a trivial band.Extended note from 2010. The Beatles were not a terribly interesting band, but their fans were and still are an interesting phenomenon. I can only name religious fundamentalists as annoying (and as threatening) as Beatles fans, and as persevering in sabotaging anyone who dares express an alternate opinion of their faith. They have turned me into some kind of Internet celebrity not because of the 6,000 bios that i have written, not because of the 800-page book that i published, not because of the 30 years of cultural events that i organized, but simply because i downplayed the artistic merits of the Beatles, an action that they consider as disgraceful as the 2001 terrorist attacks.Jakub Krawczynski sent me this supportive comment in 2010:I find it quite amusing that almost all of the Beatles songs have their own entries on Wikipedia (nothing wrong with that in itself, actually), even if they are not singles, and each of them is meticulously dissected as if there were transcendental suites exceeding human comprehension, yet bands like Faust or Red Krayola, etc. have biographies even shorter than just one article about any random Beatles song. Needless to say, none of their songs have any articles on them, yet I'm sure there would be a lot more to talk about. Moreover, if you had put any bad review of their album on the site with the intention to show the broader scope of opinions, you'd risk your ""life"" there, since such fanatics don't accept any single sign of trying to be objective. You are seen as public enemy number 1 to them. It is like your article is one giant cognitive dissonance to them and vandalizing your bio was the only way to reduce this dissonance.(Italian text translated by Ornella C. Grannis and proof-edited by Daniel Vogel )The Beatles most certainly belong to the history of the 60s, but their musical merits are at best dubious.The Beatles came at the height of the reaction against rock and roll, when the innocuous ""teen idols"", rigorously white, were replacing the wild black rockers who had shocked the radio stations and the conscience of half of America. Their arrival represented a lifesaver for a white middle class terrorized by the idea that within rock and roll lay a true revolution of customs. The Beatles tranquilized that vast section of the population and conquered the hearts of all those (first and foremost the females) who wanted to rebel, without violating the social status quo. The contorted and lascivious faces of the black rock and rollers were substituted by the innocent smiles of the Beatles; the unleashed rhythms of the first were substituted by the catchy tunes of the latter. Rock and roll could finally be included in the pop charts. The Beatles represented the quintessential reaction to a musical revolution in the making, and for a few years they managed to run its enthusiasm into the ground.Furthermore, the Beatles represented the reaction against a social and political revolution. They arrived at the time of the student protests, of Bob Dylan, of the Hippies, and they replaced the image of angry kids, fists in the air, with their cordial faces and amiable declarations. They came to replace the accusatory words of militant musicians with overindulgent nursery rhymes. Thus the Beatles served as middle-class tranquilizers, as if to prove the new generation was not made up exclusively of rebels, misfits and sex maniacs.For most of their career, the Beatles were four mediocre musicians who sang melodic three-minute tunes at a time when rock music was trying to push itself beyond that format, one originally confined by the technical limitations of the 78 rpm record. They were the quintessence of ""mainstream"" (assimilating the innovations proposed by rock music) within the format of the melodic song.The Beatles belonged, like the Beach Boys (whom they emulated throughout most of their career), to the era of the vocal band. In such a band the technique of the instrument was not as important as that of the chorus. Undoubtedly skilled at composing choruses, they availed themselves of producer George Martin (head of Parlophone since 1956), to embellish those choruses with arrang",1
16293,Fishing Planet,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAt first, my thoughts were ""why on earth am I playing a fishing game when I don't even like fishing?"". However, I quickly began to realise that the people who play this game are all really nice and they all seem to contribute to the fun, relaxing atmosphere of the game. In my opinion, Fishing Planet has a lot of potential, perhaps as a game perhaps aimed at an older audience, and could even attract people who are inexperienced in fishing, such as myself, by going into more detail in explanations and tutorials, etc. Overall, I'd say give it a try if you want a relaxing and peaceful experience, and if it's not your thing then just uninstall it.",1

3699,Fractured Space,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewEARLY ACCESS and PROBABLY ALPHA!... NOTE THAT ABOUT THIS REVIEW!!This game need ALOT of fixing and adding if its going to be worth anything.However.. I will give an easy setup of good and bad parts of this so far.Positive:- Good space mechanics: It feels like you are flying a massive ship in space. Which is good cause its a space combat sim.- Ships and critical points: There are ship classes that are somewhat ballanced. Some unfair (looking at the cloak and short range 1 hit kill switch one) , but it all makes it better when you can damage parts of ships and take even MOAR damage!- Combat: Combat is slow, yet fast. Its like I have said.. It feeeeels like a space game that you see in Homeworld and typical space games/sci fi games. Cannons takes time to turn and same does the ships. Its like Star Conflict done more realistic.NEGATIVE PARTS!!!- Cloak and short range weapons: Probably the most broken ship in the game. Dont remember the name of the ship (assault I think), BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE!! It is stupid. Compare to the Sniper class, this ship is broken and either needs a huge nerf or be terminated.- The game outside graphics and game mechanics: Apparently from what I see, its going to be a MMO PVP MOBA ish game. It also has a cheap version of Star Conflict with the lobby. From what I see, there will be only online gaming with this game and no PVE.- Gamemodes: Capture the enemy headquarters... oooooooooh thats boring... that is the only gamemode at this point. OOOOOOH THAT IS BORING!There is really not much to say about this game, cause there is almost nothing in this.Its not a bad game, just feel the DEVS are holding it back. ALOT. They could have added Deathmatch, team deathmatch or anything else to make it more fun, or even have more variants that are not so ""straight out of the class system book of any mmo / RPG game"". Owell. I suggest not buying the game yet. Maybe later? Only time will tell.Gonna give it a thumbs up cause... the devs to see that they can do it.",1
19310,Elsword,2015.0,"tl;dr: it's your typical korean mmoLong version:So I think I've wasted enough precious hours to this game to state some glaring problems with it. It's more hours than what Steam says, I started before the Steam greenlight if memory serves.0. Weeaboo simulator1. Free 2 play, pay 2 win system. The entire cash shop is a joke.2. PvP is broken, especially with new classes and it's full of cheap hoes spamming autotracking skills and the sort3. My experience with the community was terribad with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s leaving in the middle of a game, not being very supportive, and generally being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s4. Absolutely atrocious drop rates of items. I don't know if I was just that unlucky, but I had to constantly redo dungeons for the job advance quests, which consist of annoying, repetitive chores like defeat this boss X times and get Y items. The worst is the combination of those two - get Z of boss drops. So if the random number generator didn't agree with me (which happened a lot), I had do the dungeon all over again. It's all horrible luck based bull that wastes hours of time and stamina, which brings me to the next issue.5. The asinine stamina system. Run out of stamina, can't play any more dungons for the day, unless you pay more. Just, why? I decide when to stop playing, not the game. (I think it has to do with a law in South Korea that limits how long kids can play)6. The game's definition of ""balance"" may greatly differ from yours. Or they may not care at all. Which seems to be the case since these new characters recently are all about ""Let's make this class more epic than the last"" and end up utterly breaking the gameplay as a result of these obnoxious wanks showing off.7. Grinding for levels, job advancement, farming for items, pretty much the entire PvE gameplay in general gets stale, boring and repetitive after a while, especially with the stamina system and hyper OP guys running around flexing their PAY2WIN benefits killing any potential enjoyment. Dungeons are as linear as linear can be.Honestly, I can't say that I didn't have some fun with this game. This is a Korean MMO, and Korean MMOs love hyper, epic and flashy combos that with fast paced action can give your eyes quite the colorful seizure. The skills look cool when you're running around beating up stuff and it's mildly exciting with a full party, especially when you're ganging up on bosses whacking the ever living daylights out of them. The game has its moments. It just gets old and routine pretty quickly, especially at higher levels where leveling and quests becomes a little more than a drawn out chore that gets increasingly stretched out by the dumb stamina system. Check it out if you don't mind these issues and the microtransaction advantages, but I personally would just invest my time in a good game.If you like the game, you may want to consider Void Elsword. It's a private server without the BS of NA from what I've heard.",0

I enjoyed this game before this latest couple of patches. I can't stand it anymore though. I played medic when I first got the game and you were a welcome addition to any team. A while back they gave stupid fast regen if out of combat for 10 seconds and that eliminated the need for a medic because people just run away heal and come back. I moved to plasma launchers which were a mass shot of exploding projectiles. Absolutely crap against nimble enemies, high speed cars or jet-flyers, but anyone caught in the artillery-like blast was doom sauced. It got turned into a rapid fire mini explosive that does next to nothing for damage. I can't play this game anymore.

This restriction severely handicaps someone's ability to obtain currency in the game, unless they can pay at least $32 a month.$32 a month.

1014,Star Trek Online,2014.0,"Star Trek Online, or STO, is a game set in the space age with giant ships, a whole selection of races (Not Racing) and a vast galaxy to explore! I will recomend this to people who like Star Trek and to people who don't really know anything about it as through the story telling you will get to grips with basics of Star Trek knowledge. This game is still being updated regulary and has seasonal and daily events that add hours of gameplay added onto the 100+ hours of storyline, side quests and PvP. As this is a Cryptic game the customization is superb from the ships you fly to the crew who fly it. Now this game plays in two ways, one way is with your ship and the other is on the ground. As this is a mmorpg you can get together and play with your friends and play through the missions together or you can play on your own. This game is completely different to other popular mmorpg's as this brings another aspect to the gameplay as it's not just a grind fest on the ground but in space with a whole galaxy to explore meeting different races and player along the way. Now when you start the game you can pick from 3 main races, Starfleet, Klingon and Romulan all having different quests, ships, planets, weapons, armors and gameplay styles so they all offer a different way to play. Now as this game is made by Cryptic it does have some Pay to Win ascpects or in this case pay to unlock before unlocking as about 60% of the items and ships you can get from the 2 non payed currency, zen being the payed one. I am going to give this game a 8/10 as it has 100's of hours of gameplay, regular updates and a vast community; but let down by its small glitches.",1

The fact is that they are totally revamping the game to give us the players what we want, so the game is essentially new. I dont think its fair to hate and talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about a game that is being reworked in order to give us more fun. So far they have been listening and trying to give us what we want in a mmorpg, ofcourse there will be hiccups along the way but people just need to chill out. There are plans of endgame content updates, new classes, Class balancing in the upcoming months so lets let the devs do their work while we play their game and provide our insight on what needs fixing. Either you want to be a supporter of the mmorpg community, Help new games grow or just silently wait for something else, trash talking anything is stupid, childish and petty af.

9250,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2014.0,"Raceroom is a great racing simulator. It has good physics and graphics, and AMAZING sounds. Simbin has done a great job capturing the feel. Now, the downside I'm goign to point out is that this is not entirely free to play. It is essentially a base game with a couple cars and tracks. Extra tracks and cars must be bought. Raceroom is constantly being updated with new content, if you want to buy stuff wait until it goes on sale. Everything eventually will go on sale for at least %50 off. If you ever need any input the raceroom discussion board is a great place as well. ==In Short==: Awesome Racing Sim, but Not Truly FTP. ",1
10495,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat gameplay and teamwork.  The different types of ships you can earn make it dynamic.  Right now, the only multiplayer mode is 5x5 and the games take about 15-25 minutes.  It'll be interesting to see different arenas and map types later on.  Note to Players:  You can't be a hero in this game.  You need to pay attention to what your team is doing and figure out your place.  Being a support ship and either healing a large attack or defense ship or sacrificing yourself to steal an enemy's ground can make all the difference, so don't knock what seems like a lesser role off the table without giving it a try.  Sometimes glory is achieved in unexpected ways during this game, which gives it great potential.I paid the $20 for the Vanguard Founders' pack because I enjoyed the game and want the devs to earn what they deserve.  Let's hope they continue to do the job right.",1
1944,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2018.0,"I am sad to give this one a negative review, since I had quite a bit of fun with it. The thing is, it seems at some point the algorithms started stacking games either for or against me; and I do not just mean combo stuff. I mean games where you get all the high-cost cards (think maybe 5-6 out of a deck of 50-60 cards) you cannot play, one after the other, at the beginning, while the opponent gets a regular mix (or vice-versa); I mean getting only actions or only items for the first few hands, even in balanced decks. For months on end, I thought to myself ""it's just coincidence"" or ""players got better as time wore on""; but no. After many experiments with all manner of combinations, I for one am convinced that, at the very LEAST, there is a problerm with the shuffling algorithm, although I am inclined to believe what I have read in several places: the game now seems to stack odds for or against one of the players.I love the art, I like the mechanics in general and I have had interesting, challenging games with many people, but for the past three monthsd or so, I have become endlessly frustrated and hence, decided to uninstall the game, as it is no longer fun.",0
6692,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIn the current state of this game i would not recommend it to anyone. The warrior is still way to overpowered, there is a complete lack of weapon balance, and the developers are highly incompetent. Since launch this game has had some major flaws(that most people would agree on) that are very easly fixable, but instead of fixing them the devs over look this problems and completly throw it under the bus. The developers will be the sole demise of this game due to theire complete lack of brains and common sense. As of July 6th they released 2 weapons that were completly overpowered, im pretty sure a monkey could of told you there were overpowered without even playing the game. This is a picture perfect example of how incompetent the devs of this game are. If they want to have any chance of having a sucessful game they need to start  listening to the people who play this game, they need to start asking questions, they need to start testing weapons and there little expirements in the test server and not in the main servers, and for god sake they need to start fixing and balancing the game. Everything else can wait... As of today i will currently not be playing this game anymore! My diamond 2 rank and 76hr of gameplay will be put on hold untill either A- The devs get theire♥♥♥♥♥♥together, or B the game gets sold off to a company/dev team that actually knows what theire doing.",0
15492,Magic Duels,2015.0,"ok first up i played around 48 hrs of this game since launch and its august 2nd 2015 right now.TDLR at bottom.Pros:-its free to play. Takes like 76 boosters with 6 cards per booster to finish collecting all the cards atm. They said they will be adding more cards every 3 months. Boosters will not give repeats which is a plus. Even though playing against players with a more fleshed out deck could be a little more challenging there is no reason you can't win with this starting pool.Ppl say u can't manually select the lands, they are wrong u can select them. Also there is an option to turn off auto blocking. All this they would know if they have completed the story properly.There are 5 campaigns for story mode with 5 missions per campaign. You get 150 gold total from ea campaign.  During the campaign you'll be given the option to do skill quests which teach you the intricates of the game and also award you with ~15 gold. So total of 750 + 250~ = 1000~ gold which you can buy boosters with where ea booster is 150 gold. So around 6-8 boosters.-Good learning curve for beginners of magic. Yes ppl say the campaign ai  has pre built flavorful decks and even some veterans find it difficult to overcome. That is the whole point of story mode. It is there to teach new players how some tactics can be overcome, and it also sheds more light on how a lot of the mechanics can be used differently. If it was easy, beginners would come out of story mode fighting veterans of the magic community not even having a clue how they were defeated and blame the balance on a small starting pool. Expect to lose and retry a lot in the story mode. You don't need to finish it for veteran players, you just need to finish the first campaign to start building your own deck.-Deck building. Utter free reign on your deck building as opposed to previous planewalker installments. You can use a deck building wizard or do it manually.-UI. I just want to touch upon this since I read a lot of the negative reviews are from this category. Yes after like 3-4 iterations of this game the ui should be polished. I haven't experience any of the problems they have touched upon in the negative reviews( like black screens and unresponsiveness), but I'm also using a more up to date pc compared to what some ppl are using, The game when it came out had a lot of server issues disconnecting which could of infuriated a lot of the players, it most certainly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off when I finally defeated lilliana's campaign after 3 times beating her just to find that I have been disconnected and the results haven't been recorded. But I didn't let that affect my review which a lot of ppl were mostly complaining about. It is around launch so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.I'll list the cons of the ui in the cons section, but atm I have no problems with the visibility of the UI and it's responsiveless, with only a few gripes on the available options.-earning boosters. Vs hard ai for 15gold, probably the fastest way since ai's don't need to think and make you wait. With a good deck you can prob knock off an ai every 10 mins~. Vs human you get 20 gold.A lot of ppl complain about the coding of this game not being done properly, but I find it decently well programmed since I have been through programming courses, when fighting the ai and looking at how a lot of cards demand a lot of what if and what not commands I find that the programmers have done very well in all the special situations that all the cards demand. Not to mention the ai are actually hard, they will fall for some more complex human tactics but often then not if you let your guard down they will kill you. A lot of times I find myself beating the opponent human to find him rage and replaced by ai just to get beaten by the ai later on. I have only seen one or two coding errors within my 40~ hrs of play time, when using a destroy target artifact enchantment spell I removed the creature along with the enchantment aura it had, and when an opponenet killed my creature with an enchantment aura that gave me life, my opponent got the life boost too when it was already used.-Don't want to look like a nerd while playing the paper version in public? You can be a nerd at home.Cons-UI, they have removed chat from the ui. There's no voice communication either. This goes right up there in ways to ruin a great a game.The skip atk phase button is in the same position as the continue button so after spamming continue because you have nothing to do on main phase but you want to atk on atk phase you can screw urself over.The option to skip when human player quits in the middle. But most of the time I would welcome the free gold, but there should be a quality of life option to leave the game as well.Taking the time to think on main phase but running out of time automatically skips you through atk phase and 2nd main phase after atk phase. There should be some sort of flashy mechanic to draw ur attention when ur about to run out of time and also to not skip thru all ur phases.-earning gold. Max 400 gold earned per day so 20 games of winning against humans. Even though it's very hard to win more than 20 games considering the time it takes for a human match, the limit should be bumped a littler high for those of the community that want to enjoy the game f2p so they can unlock more cards and bring their dream deck to reality sooner. With that being said I do find the grind a little slow to unlock more cards to unlock more flavorable plays, but I do respect the gold earned per a play since the game is f2p.2 headed dragon doesn't reward gold. To me this is very weird. Considering this mode is a fan favorite and it takes a much longer time to finish compared to single vs, I don't see the reason to not add gold reward. Hopefully this will be changed later but atm this is probably the main reason to not recommend to a friend.No 4 player ffa. I know some argue that the current iteration of cards are probably not suited for a ffa brawl but this mode was a lot of fun in it's previous games and options would definitely not hurt the community but vice versa. TDLR. with the basics of a mtg game covered and free to play but without the quality of life options, communication with ppl, and most important of all U CANT EARN GOLD FROM PLAYING TWO HEADED DRAGON, I don't recommend this. With that being said you can enter this game and play for free, but the grind will not be friendly to new comers.",0

14620,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's alpha so there are some bugs and occasionally latency issues. That being said this game is already very fun and already has a ton of potential.Tried fornite, hated the building. Played a lot of PUBG, fun for a while but playing 30 minutes, not seeing anyone, and then getting headshot by a guy that happened to be looking in your direction was pretty lame. It is so refreshing to play a fast paced BR game the fights feel like FIGHTS, intense, fast paced, and dynamic.",1
19796,DCS World Steam Edition,2016.0,"Thought I'd go over this piece of software once again.Out of the box you get 2 airplanes:- The TF-51 is the training variant of the famous P-51 and gets no weapons. If you just want to learn more about flying and working the Mustang, this is great. If you're looking for anything combat related it's worthless.- The SU-25T was part of the Flaming Cliffs expansion for LOMAC almost 10 years ago. ED praised it for the enhanced realism but not much has happened since then. Like all FC3 planes it ONLY uses keyboard commands instead of an interactive cockpit. It flies like a brick and russian avionics are not the easiest to work with, so this isn't really a gift to new players, it's a reminder that you get what you paid for. ""You paid nothing, so you get this (in contrast) ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plane. Please buy our DLCs.""You won't be flying anything else until you pay for it but you get access to multiplayer and the mission editor. What you're gonna do with the latter, besides training missions when all you know is a crappy ground attack plane, I don't know but it's a nice bonus for those more advanced (who probably bought some DLC already anyways).Speaking of DLCs (excluding FC3): Full price for one highly detailed plane isn't anything new and learning the plane over weeks or months will make it well worth the pricetag, after all that's what you bought it for, right? If not, ED offers 'game mode' which turns DCS into an arcade game ""for new players"".Well, you're not really learning from 'game mode', nobody cares about it and yet it's a selling point. Are there seriously people who buy a full price module and turn on game mode, which makes the module worth maybe 5€?Flaming Cliffs 3 can be fun but is weak as a simulator. As mentioned on the SU-25T you don't get an interactive cockpit in any of these planes. You're lucky to find a switch that moves when you press the corresponding button. Some of it is due to classified information, which in the past led to the cancelation of other modules like the F/A-18E or SU-27SM, because without these information you can't accurately simulate the plane. Makes sense.This makes ED a bunch of hypocrates because they ""demand high quality from 3rd party developres"" while at the same time recycling some 10+ year old content. Yes, there have been some updates but I still feel like playing the same ancient simulation again.I also feel this way when I look at some of the non-flyable planes. The graphics aren't an issue since you rarely see these up close, but their flight models are. The MiG-25 for example can fly with only one wing and the weapons will just hover in place. It's a known problem for years, but it hasn't been fixed.Well, AI can be too dumb to fly anyways. I can't recall how often I engaged multiple bandits on the highest difficulty, just to find half of them circling around somewhere (at stall speed) instead of getting behind me, like they are waiting to be tagged in.Ground forces don't have noteworthy AI at all. They either sit in place or follow waypoints, even roads if desired. Once engaged however they will scatter a bit and then just sit there, waiting to die. All they do to defend themselfes is shoot back when you get into range. I think it's balanced by the fact that AI can see through trees anyways, making forests 100% worthless as cover. At least amphibious vehicles can cross rivers if the bridge is destroyed.Multiplayer in a flight sim should be the greatest thing but for 2017 it's really bad.For starters, there is a memory leak somewhere that ED seems to deny exists. A well populated server can reach 30+GB memory usage in a few hours, ultimately resulting in a crash. There is no dedicated server to at least get rid of all the unnecessary graphics data nor a command line parameter to automate the restart. This causes problems on the player side too. If somebody joins there is a chance the whole server will freeze for a second because the server is doing something I suppose. After all these years of online multiplayer this is pathetic, even for a sim.The majority of servers are bad anyways. The same old training mission used as a template, misplaced aircraft that get damaged on spawn, idiotic placement of ground units, worthless AI settings, team stacking even though most PvP missions offer the same planes on both sides (which also makes visually telling friend and foe appart almost impossible, even when zooming in to try making out the insignias) ... and let me ask: why would you include the unarmed TF-51 or any other WW2 plane in a PvP mission with modern anti air? Trying to simulate ""The Final Countdown""?Bottom line:Simulations have always been special, including DCS' precursors but I don't see the leap into the next generation. Quad cores aren't fully utilized, same with RAM, partially worthless AI, lack of polish across most areas, no official server/admin tools, long lasting issues getting denied and never fixed. Even if DCS is the best military flight sim out there, it's still bad.",0

1806,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016.0,"I had a lot of fun some years back in the 2012-2014 reaching the rank of Supreme mostly playing with friends but also as solo. I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene. WTF has happened? This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.DON'T GET ME WRONG HEREI have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.There is huge but in all this:Are you willing to pay a subscription?If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates. And this scenario this year doesn't happen for the first time.",0

2146,theHunter Classic,2016.0,"DO NOT READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. PLEASE READ THIS FIRST. This is a very good hunting game. As a real life hunter, I enjoy the level of realism this game provides. It's not realistic in many ways, but it's not a hunting sim (even though I wish it was). That being said, it's certainly the most realistic hunting game on the market. It has a wide variety of environments, weapons, species, and equipment. It has incredible graphics, good AI, awesome online multiplayer, real-time competitions, interesting missions, decent skill system with acheivements, a photo gallery of your kills, and decent statistics tracking. The gameplay is fun while remaining somewhat realistic, but it does have a learning curve. Once you understand how the game works, you'll have a blast. The negative reviews almost all come from people who did not read what they were downloading. They thought this was a completely free game without doing any research into it. theHunter DOES have a subscription based system and microtransactions, but it's not all bad. They just updated their F2P model and it is more than fair now. Keep reading.As I write this review, currently there are 10 maps, 29 huntable species, and one species of dog you can bring hunting with you. When you download the game for free as a guest you are able to access all maps. However, you can only hunt 5 species for free (whitetail deer, pheasant, and three rabbit species). The free species are on all but one map. All other species require a license that you can either earn by doing missions for in-game currency (gm$) or buy with real money (em$). You can even earn em$ by doing sponsor deals (which I have not done, so I can't tell you whether or not I recommend it). You cannot shoot animals you don't have a license for. You are given two weapons (12GA Single Shot Shotgun and .243 Bolt-Action Rifle with unlimited ammo) and a few other items for free to start your hunting. This shotgun is legal for every species in the game as long as you're using the correct shells (birdshot, buckshot, or slugs), the rifle is legal for mid-sized animals including the Whitetail. Check the wiki for more information.Between the missions for the 5 free species, you can earn plenty of gm$ to purchase a host of equipment to improve your chances of being successful, and even buy licenses for additional species. That's all without spending any real money. This route should be considered more of a demo to the full game, as it teaches you about the basics of what the game has to offer. Once you're convinced that the full version is worth the money, you can purchase a membership bundle or subscription. Subscribers unlock all animals, maps, and unlimited free ammunition for the duration of their subscription. Bundles are the best value if you're just getting into the game, however. Bundles include a subscription and a host of weapons and equipment. I would HIGHLY recommend the Trailrunner Bundle ($49.99), which includes a year's subscription and a HOST of weapons and equipment. When your year's subsription is ending, you can renew your subscription for another full year for only $34.99. There are tons of extra weapons and equipment you can buy a-la-carte with em$ (real money). I've spent an absolutely ridiculous amount of money on this game and I don't regret it. I love hunting and this is the best hunting game out there. You don't have to spend a ton of money to enjoy it though. You can have fun for free or take it up to a great time for $49.99. The subscription is fair and necessary because the devs are CONSTANTLY updating the game and adding new maps, species, and other features. Even if you don't want to spend money on the game, you can download what is a great free whitetail deer hunting game.Before you go trashing a great game, do some research on what you're actually getting into. It is not fair at all to the devs or long-time players who want this game to be supported for years to come. There is a wiki and forum for learning and getting involved in theHunter's great community.

3884,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"I've been playing for over a year and even though there are things that bother me I still really enjoy this game. I initially started playing because of how generous the game is (at least one free pack a day) but I kept playing because of how fun it was. There are numerous single player modes (that give prizes) to build up as your skills.  Besides the standard modes to play against players they also run limited time events you can buy into with gold. I love how they keep the community engaged by periodically releasing ""promo"" cards for a limited time that you get with only one win. I do have two big complaints about the game.  The first is that when you hit a non-game where you have too much or too little power it's incredibly frustrating not being able to do anything. I understand that is a part of card games but why can we have a first draw that is only one power? I always reject those. The second issue I have is that there are combos (mostly with infiltrate) that bring you down from high health to death in one turn.  It can be a SLOW process watching one card get played over and over and over again. You would think these would be nerfed but that's not always the case. Now that the game is released I'm looking forward to see what new things are added in the future.",1

Steam loves to mess up with other games that use theyr own launcher, do not trust Steam.Game is great, still feels unfinished, but certainly is more alive than H1D1 (2 years old) that daybreak is constantly trying to keep alive, meanwhile planetside 2 (much much older) is doing just great, but needs more attention from Daybreak to get better.Planetside 2 is not like CS:GO or other FPS where you have matchmaking, in here you fight in a war, and wars dont separate the newbies from veterans, play with the best and become the best.TIP TO GET BETTER -> either shot in the head, or shot in the body if you can't have a clear headshot, there's no science to the game. Veterans simply know when and where to hit you (map reading is very important too, you'll get the hang of it eventualy).I totaly recomend this game even if it feels unfinished, you can have some pretty epic moments once in a while.It is also better played with ""Recursion Stat Tracker"", search it up, its easy to install and use.",1
12794,Star Trek Online,2015.0,"The ground combat in this game is a tad broken to say the least, but the space combat is where this game truly shines. If you're new to MMOs this game can be a bit confusing at the start, but it's easy enough to learn. The storyline is kind of boring until you hit the level 50+ missions, at which point it gets quite good.

I scored the max a lot of times and I've even not seen a single super-rare/skill for the most of times.people play the game to have fun, for hobby and to pass a good timec.. in my opinion, 79 days to create a deck (and I am work n progress) are definitely too much. is not fun anymore.moreover 3 packs cost 2.29$ and every pack contains 3 cards (for the digital cards is insane) you cant even buy the exact card or skill. konami should increase the drop rate and the skill obtaining process to make this game consistent and funny. i kown their aim is make moneys but this make the game annoying. you spend money ok = create more deck and faster, you send no money = no competitive game (ages of tme to create a consistent and effective deck)just to let you know my stas up to date: 79 days of playing (most in android), 3824 duels, almost 20k of diamonds used for deck. > (no skill?!?! seriously?!?!)",0

16863,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game is configured by default to only run on one CPU core, only utilizes 150MB of VRAM, has mouse smoothing enabled, is framelocked to 60FPS, and the vertical camera moves slower than the horizontal camera. None of these settings can be changed without delving into several .ini files.Every single class moves and turns with ASDW, and straves with Q E, turning the camera with right clicks... except berserker, which inexplicably strafes with A D and has the camera locked to the mouse. This makes clicking several important UI elements which cannot be set to a hotkey a bit frustrating, and when a loot roll pops up your mouse completely stops controlling your camera until you bid on the item... even if you are in the middle of fighting a boss. This jarring transition got me killed several times.Every single skill description seems to have been run through google translate and babelfish several times to the point where I have no idea what most of my skills do. There is an ability which can be upgraded to ""Increases the cooldown cooldown, but further reduces cooldown cooldown."" What??? My main ability has dozens of little white boxes in the tooltip, signifying invalid characters. When you level up, the game says ""WELCOME TO 2LEVEL"".The chat censorship is so intense that the word ""mage"" is censored. Why? Because ""ag"" is apparently lewd. You cannot tell someone that you'll meet them in an hour, because ""hour"" is censored... because it contains the letters ""ho"". The GMs accidentally censored themselves in a server message ironically apologizing for the restrictive chat filter, because the ""se"" in cause is filtered.More than half of my ""playtime"" was spent staring at an offline server or a queue.... this was a horrible cash grab by neowiz and I should have seen it coming. The game is almost unplayable in its current state, and even if you could play it... you wouldn't want to.",0
4186,Star Trek Online,2014.0,"For those people who like MMO RPG games and Star Trek. Head out and start star treking.Depends though however how you like to trek. Lets make one thing clear you dont play this game to explore. If you want to do that play bridge crew. This game is heavily focused on a kill or be killed Star Trek adventure. With many different weapons, both ground and space, and ships, one can not simply have enough. Is this game pay to win?Honestly not in the way you think. First off dont play PVP, as someone who has bought ships even I hate PVP, some people have death dreadnaught able to slam you while you barely dent them. However, PVE allows any ship from free to premium. Premium currency exists as well as loot boxes, no surprise as it is free to play. However, you dont actually need to buy any. Every Summer and every Winter there is an event that everyone can play and by doing a short mission everyday for a couple days you are given a free ship which is on level with the new one released all the time (T6 ship). Those ships however, are not as iconic as the ones you would get with premium currency. Now you can grind the premium currency but it will take you a very very long time. In that case it is pay for convenience. The loot box system is unintrusive, unless you are a ship collector with some ships going for exuberant prices. All in all I like this game. I feel that if it keeps up with its numbers it could last a while and with the introduction of another faction right around the corner, who knows how long we will be able to cruise the galaxy together.",1
13177,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"pros: - unique art style - instanced quest boss fights so you don't have to fight with other players to progress - klaipeda has nice musiccons:- extremely repetitive gameplay that involves auto attacking most of the time because you run out of MP so fast due to there being no mp usage balance for skills; skills have very long cooldowns and very high MP costs- skills have a limited number of monsters it actually effects, so if you gather too many monsters your skills won't damage most of them even though they're within range- some skills require items to use, so you're limited by how long your supplies last and how much you can afford rather than leaving whenever your mp gets low- some classes use skills that effect the ground only, so there are times when their attacks are rendered useless because there are a number of flying monsters in various maps, forcing them to auto attack enemies instead or have to run around looking for monsters they can actually kill- the game itself provides no insight as to where you're supposed to allocate your points so it's easy to screw up your build as early as the beginning of the game because you tried to experiment - creature diversity is extremely poor in just about all the maps - you'll see dozens of the same monster in the same spot on many occasions, sometimes on top of each other- too many weapon/skill types vs monster weaknesses to deal with which makes questing a pain; there are many forced boss fights, so you'll more than likely be faced with a boss that is strong against the majority of your attacks or ones you can't hit with your skills because they fly- you have to repair your equipment frequently because you can't do much in the game besides auto attack monsters until they die (attacking multiple enemies at once degrades your equipment faster)- the value of monster drops has been reduced when selling to npc shops since beta, making it even harder to pay for repairs, potions, attributes, and other items- tanking in itself is completely flawed in the sense that you take almost no damage so you can gather large groups of monsters at once, but because of that, your equipment degrades at rates many times that of people who are able to kill monsters much more quickly - bosses are boring at best - most of the time you're autoattacking them for ~5 minutes depending on your class while running in circles to avoid their extremely predictable attacks. - their AI is poor and often they will pause in place for seconds at a time after using an attack.- many of their attacks don't fit their design and are recycled (a tree boss and others randomly shoot bullet hell-type of pellets at you). - many different bosses have the same attacks, even if they're an entirely different creature- hitboxes are very poor, so you'll wonder how you even got hit half of the time, especially during boss fights- quest boss progression is extremely unbalanced - in some cases you can fell a boss in a matter of seconds, but a boss one level higher may take minutes; some higher level bosses are actually weaker than lower level ones- almost no character customization in the game, unless of course you're comfortable spending up to $30 for a permanent hairstyle. temporary ones are around $15. you can unlock some hair colors through gameplay (kill thousands of the same monster to unlock), but they're very dull colors that otherwise should have been added to character creation- everyone has the same lifeless face - there are no facial options to choose from and there are no hair colors to choose from because the colors are locked to the styles- aside from hair style, every class looks the same, so you'll always run into clones of your character (especially in towns)- the only customization after character creation besides the very few unlockable hair colors are hats you can get from monsters that do a poor job of making your character feel unique- player to player trading has been REMOVED...unless you buy premium membership that costs $15 a month that gives the following benefits:* increased movement speed for your character - run around maps faster and hunt for world bosses much easier* reduce the tax from the market from 30% (normal) to 10% (premium)* increases the amount of items you can list on the marketplace simultaneously from 1 to 5* allow training of 2 attributes at once, which has the potential to save hundreds of hours of time as there are hundreds of attributes to buy for all the skills combined- founders get an entire month of head start got damn",0

Great game to watch for, and a no-brainer buy if it's on sale.A note on matchmaking. I mentioned it is haphazard because currently there is no way to know what kind of match you are jumping into if it is already in progress. i have jumped into a game just to catch the last few seconds of us losing. i know it would be a monumental task, but i really feel that leaving players should be replaced with an AI pilot in the same ship, and people looking for matches should not be able to join matches in progress. ALSO i feel that there should be some form of ""partying up"". if you want to play with friends, it's near impossible to get everyone on the same team. hopefully this is a hot topic, and it gets adressed soon.",1
5576,Aura Kingdom,2016.0,"Those looking for an anime MMORPG, Aura Kingdom would be the first game I would go to.Pros Colorful, vibrant, and overall looks like the most majestic game I have probably ever seen for a MMO. Rich storyline. I have personally spent at least 30 bucks on the game, and the rewards are very good for the money. I got 100$ worth of in-game items, and it is well worth it. The game does not restrict you and hound you to buy any type of currency, or a monthly subscription. In fact, the game does not have a montly subscription. Perdiod. What you would pay for is something extra, and even if you don't pay for anything, it does not take away from the game. Very compatable with computers, the settings can be really low and still look good at 60FPS for a computer that can run most, but not all games. The game can also look fantastic for higher-end computers. There is always something new to do. A lot of updates, and that always means new content. The game has a Sword Art Online aspect to it, for those who like the idea of SAO. PVP, duels, ect, and the combat is very entertaining to watch. The combat system is nothing like ANY other MMO. In higher levels of the game, the combat is very stategiec. Clans, guilds, you name it. There is a lot of this in the game, and the guild community is a very good community, aside from the ""discount currency"" scammer community. When you hit level 60, you unlock a function in the game where you can dungeon dive with a large group of people in a floored tower. The higher the level you achieve, the more rewards, and bigger bosses. This is another SAO aspect of the game. Many good classes to choose from, and you can have DUAL CLASSES at level 40. Combat includes a skill-point tree, which not many, if any other MMO's I know of have. Soundtrack is simply amazing, and fits really well with the game. Addicting. Really. Large playerbase.Cons The company does not have the best reputation, and making my first purchase has been a issue with them, as what I paid for was credited only two weeks after I actually bought it. I emailed them, and they said they were ""protecting against fraud"" and still did not fix it for two weeks, after emailing again and again, countless times. This should have not been a issue, and they do this with all first-time purchases, from what I know. Even if it not the games fault, the community is horrible. There is a lot of spam sites and links that will be sent to your inbox while passing through largely populated areas, and taking over the global chat. Leveling can be fast, as I reached level 63 within a month and a half. This might feel underpowering and not much of a challenge at all, however, it gives you a powerful feeling over most players. I am not sure if I count this as a negitive, it depends on how you view it. Players like me would like a bit more of a challenge. ",1

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the game is actually great, and has a skill curve to its mechanics like maneuvering in such slow ships but also in aiming precisely. On first launch, my machine ran the game quite choppily, but that was all resolved after altering the settings quite a bit. Nonetheless, I enjoy the variety of ships, and at the moment I'm using the British line. yet every nation's line is relatively balanced.

9558,Realm of the Mad God,2018.0,"Realm of the Mad God is a medieval-themed rogue-like with 2D pixel graphics. There is no story or campaign, only some background lore. The object in the game is to wreck havoc and kill creatures on a  huge  island (the realm). These creatures are Oryx's (the Mad God) minions. Killing them will earn exp and drop some occasional loot. Killing tougher monsters (gods) will♥♥♥♥♥♥Oryx off (hence the name:  Mad  god). When angry, Oryx will teleport the players on the island to his castle, where they will attempt to kill Oryx. When succeeded, players will teleport to another realm, starting the chain again.The game is proper fun for the first couple of hours. After that the flaws will start to point out, including annoyingly repeatitive soundtrack. It is less than two minutes long 8-bit chant.-There are too few levels (only 20), and the highest level will be achieved in just a couple of hours, tops. Each level-up will give you higher stats, determined by your class. Even after reaching lvl 20, you can still get your stats higher by consuming stat potions. The stats will eventually max out, making the corresponding number turn gold/yellow.-The equippable items are quite interesting. There are four types of equippable items: weapon, class skill, armor and ring.   There are five tiers of class skills and rings, and 10+ tiers of armors and weapons.-There are several different classes with different skills and stats for different playstyles, which makes the game much   more interesting. At first most of the classes are locked, but they can be unlocked by playing and performing well with   the earlier classes.The game is completely free, which means a strong pay-to-win aspect. There is a tremendous spike in difficulty after reaching certain areas. After traveling deep enough to the center of the island (or teleporting to hard dungeons), the game becomes somewhat unplayable. The monsters' health and damage are high enough to end your journey in a blink.Do I recommend the game? It depends on the player's expectations. If one is looking for having, fun for free, for an hour or two, then yes. If one is looking for a long, enjoyable experience, this game can not provide it. Please stay away.",0
6824,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is a card game with a playstyle that's modeled after Magic: the Gathering, and a card collection style modeled after Hearthstone (but better!). It is completely free to play, with the helpful but unnecessary option of spending money on drafts or packs to help buoy your early game card collection.  You get to keep all the cards you draft, and you also get a decent amount of shiftstone (the card-crafting currency) for each pack you open.  The game is so free to play that I was compelled to basically donate to them so I could have an uninhibited play experience.This game is for all the people who enjoy playing Magic, but have issues with the Magic Online program for any of the possible reasons.  All I wanted to do with Magic was just jam games for free and against quality opponents.  Third party software did not quite scratch that itch, so when I saw Eternal was released I jumped on board and have really taken to it.  This is perhaps Eternal's greatest strength - the bingeability of the game - yet it can also be its greatest weakness.  Because people can just queue up indiscriminately, they play a LOT more games than normal, and the dreaded ""variance sucks"" argument comes to a head more often, because you literally are more likely to be screwed by variance when you're increasing your number of games played.  If you like to complain about variance, honestly, stop playing all card games, because variance is literally what makes card games fun. That or learn to accept your lord and savior Variance McGee into your life and keep a lingering smile on your face as the game engine hands you an unwinnable hand.The game design has done a phenomenal job with the first set, with an unbelievable number of playable archetypes in constructed mode.  It won't all be tier one, but with as wildly as the meta shifts in this game, it can be fun to find that one random deck you played 2 months ago which you just realized has a strong matchup against the current meta.  Some decks will seemingly never die, but Dire Wolf Digital has shown a willingness to step in and nerf cards it sees as problems, while also buffing a few underutilized cards a bit more rarely.  Gone for me are the days of learning the combat tricks in each color, which was a very fun process to learn much like a new Magic draft format, but a new player will certainly delight in learning how to play around the opponent's tricks.  Until a new Eternal set comes out, the intellectual enjoyment on my end predominantly comes from attacking the meta in a favorable manner.I've really enjoyed the product that Dire Wolf Digital has put out, and I think it has a lot of portability over from any other popular card game a new player might be more familiar with.  If you're new to card games, there will obviously be a bit more of a learning curve, but hey, this is completely free - might as well try it out!",1

You will always be cannon fodder for the old players with upgraded weapons. Not that it is a new issue, we have that all around (Titanfall /2 for example) but here feels a bit more acute.If you want to ""git gud"", by all means, it can be a fun game to play, but be mindful that you will be killed a lot by an enemy who will one shot you after you already shot a whole clip at him and not appear to dent him.",0
12044,Fractured Space,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewDo you like MOBA gameplay such as  DOTA 2, LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, HON and other similar games?But you also like BIG♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ING SPACESHIPS WITH BIG♥♥♥♥♥GUNS SHOOTING FIERY BALLS OF DOOM AND LASORS AT OTHER SPACESHIP?THAN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU, WAIT NO LONGER AND INSTALL NOW!!Basicly you're going 5 vs 5 with a spaceship of your choice, capturing points  and eventually trying to capture the enemy base. The more points you capture the more resources you gain per second, and resources mean upgrades to your ships health and damage, giving you advantage over  the enemy ships. Currently you can choose between 15 or something ships (but this is still alpha, more ships to come for sure), you got  tanky ships, high damage ships, long range ships, close range attack ships, assasin ship (like you go in stealth mode, pop up next to enemy ship, do a lot of damage and then get the hell out of there), support ships (repair yourself and allies, or increase damage done on enemy ships for you and your allies.) and some mixed ships that have a little of everything.I can only say that i've liked this game so far, there are some downsides like laggy servers ( like 1 in 5 games for me are laggy, and 1 in 15 or so is like almost unplayable due to lagg), but that is what you get when you play alpha release. other downside is that currently it is impossible to change the controls for the game (unless you alter some files) which is really anoying if you are one of the few people (belgium,france, ...) that use AZERTY keyboards, because the controls are for QWERTY which means you control the ships movement with ZQSD instead of WSAD. You can fix this by pressing alt+Lshift to switch your keyboard to qwerty mode, but than you will not be able to type properly.  All in all, great game, I am sure they will fix these problems in the near future, and when the game goes full release there will most likely be more ships and maps  and modes to play.I rate it  7.5/10",1

Dota is now like a fu*king android and IOS game... YuckAlso the new hero...WTF is that? It is definitely like a LOL hero. Has six skills all very powerfull. It´s kinda like he has six ultimates of other heroes.

10041,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"This is a very solid CCG. The game is based around the lore of the Elder Scxrolls series of games, lots of races, spells and items in there form those games to base your decks around.It makes for a diverse game with many different kinds of decks and styles.The game has flashy graphics like many of the popular card games such as Hearthstone, nice sound effects and animations and spell effects to it all. There is a nice single player story mode in this game, that is narrated and full of choices. When you make a choice after beating an AI opponent in the story, you choose one card ore another to keep and the story changes based on that. They are expansing this often so that is a nice feature and not very costly in in game gold.You can of course buy decks with in game gold and also win them in story mode and also in versus mode too. There is an arena mode where you can play with cards you do  not own and that evens the odds against more veteran players than yourself. There is also a ranked play using your own decks too with prizes given out at the end of each ranked play season.This game has some nice original features such as split board where the left anf right side of the game board have different aspects to them such as one can be if you play a card on the right side it is hidden for one turn and cannot be attacked directly til the next turn. This adds lots of strategy to the game. There is not too much RNG(luck) in this game although there is a little. But it is not liek Hearthstone, you dont get some crazy effects every 2 cards that make it feel like you lost due to randomness.They have a feature now that if you link your twitch account and bethesda(publisher for this game) account, you can receive in game rewards for watching streamers play this game, that is a nice boost to your gold or packs and so on that drop for you that way.Overall this is a very solid game, I highly reccomend it to anybody that enjoys card games, this is one of the very best out there!",1
1919,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"This game is absolutely fantastic. Been playing since closed beta and the devs have actively been balancing the game with frequent patches, new cards every month, an absolutely /FANTASTIC/ story expansion with wonderful voice acting and difficult challenges, and all on top of very deep gameplay that in my opinion, yes, is superior to Hearthstone, having played HS for 2 years and ESL since closed beta many months ago. This is the game I can recommend more highly than any other in my steam library.",1
1584,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016.0,"I can't recommend this game after playing +650 hours, the community isn't supportive or fun to play with anymore, the skins and ""mission books"" are just a way to keep making money off the same product that a very large community bought. Source use to be fun when you hop into a server and you may or may not find the random a$$hole, but most people where very accepting and use to actually have great conversations and great games...but now its full of intense competitiveness that just makes people upset if you don't do exactly what they tell you when they tell you, even if you do what they tell you they will figure out a way that its still somehow your fault and not theirs at all.I do like competitive, but people (and trolls) need to lighten up. I know this part of the game and part of that ranking system...but that's why I'm there too. I don't just hop in for fun, I'm still looking for the ""W"". It's more rare these days to find a good set of people when you go into a casual map, but numurous people I know have had to mute everyone because again no one has anything productive or positive to say and it definitely takes away from the game. Go play dirty bomb, or...well any other FPS other then this, cause its either going to: A) waste all your time and money or B) waste your breath on this deteriorating community.UPDATE 05/10/2016:The community continues to not be supportive and never want to have fun, just win, even on casual. Casual is a place where people are suppost to practise and improve on their game, but when players begin to argue and complain (again) on ways, they do not agree with others and they immediately kick you from the game. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! You are better off finding a brand new game with people who care about the community and to further their own fun while inviting others to do the same. Oh, and if you have a stat-trak and want to switch to a new one without losing your kills it will cost you MORE MONEY ($1.30) TO SWITCH A SIMPLE NUMBER COUNTER. THEY ONLY WANT YOUR MOENY, ANYBODY AFFILIATED WITH THIS GAME/COMPANY ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY. I should mention the game is great (minus the hackers, trolls and things like the SSG jump shot kill [which I love] [They took this out in a later update]) if you're just looking to pass some time/hours and just want to blow peoples heads off, go for it.UPDATE 09/30/2016:I won't deny the AK ""sounds more real"" (barely), but all these new sounds make the guns sound like toys especially the M4A1-S. More children in the middle of the day play now when they should be in school or something and casual continues to be nothing but trash players and screamers that just want to make you deaf for some reason :/ . If you play this, competative might be your best bet for fun and good people.UPDATE 11/12/2016:Just came off a competative match and the group decided to kick me because I wanted to knife the other opponent, they were a bunch of kids all below the age of 14 and had nothing constructive or nice to say at all. I'm going to ask for my money back because this is one of the worst community's to play with along with poor updates and consistently making non-broken maps more broken/""balanced"". I have been playing on and off for years now and it looks like I may stay off this game for forever because of this toxic, unsupportive cretins and terrible company/dev updates that (again) don't help with stupid updates that don't improve the game, just their wallets.UPDATE 03/07/2017 (MM/DD/YYYY):Yet again just wanted to kill time, go on for a few casual matches and (as a terrorist) CT's have nothing but awps, autos and negevs for 4 matches in a row!!! Not rounds, games...different matches...same people, same sides, same guns. Literally not worth playing anymore...literally I don't know why I bother anymore. Again, don't buy. You're better off buying ANYTHING ELSE but this terrible time waster. I know this review is long, but it's been a small reminder over the last 9 months of on and off play to just stay away, the only reason I keep coming back is just a time filler. Also, with the case drops I just sell them right away for the pennies (it's actually gotten me some good coin for some better cheaper games), it might not seem like much, but once you get that extra dollar it helps for DLC's or those pennies that push you over that ""money limit"" when buying games. I still personally don't recommend this game, but if you choose to buy it, have fun I guess :PUPDATE 09/07/17:Literally trash. Would though away if I could. All awpers in casual, no fun in competative...its a terrible game. Don't buy it.UPDATE 06/01/18:Full of A.D.H.D., nothing but office, dust 2 and some other over played ♥♥♥♥♥♥ map.",0

20123,World of Warships,2017.0,"Been a WoWs player since 2013. Fantastic game. (Have over 2200 battles played, own 225 ships,, and well over 2,000 hours easy played since if not a lot more - cant keep track.) Unfortuneatly you cannot integrate your Wargaming account with the Steam version without creating a new account, which sucks. There is away around it, but rather use WG own launcher for this as have too much time and money gone into this game to mess with it on Steam until they allow full integration with current accounts. I also noticed the Steam client version for this game doesnt have the Ultra quality interface and sound as yet.In any case, thats not the issue. Game is absolutely fantastic for naval war. Addictive as anything. And the tme to upgrade ships, camo, upgrades, levels, and captain skills, make for a long game playing process that lets you appreciate what it has to offer. Nothing like taking the Bizmark out to battle, or HMS Hood, or the USS Enterprise with torpedo bombers, dive bombers, and fighters, and trying to coordinate all that while attackng the enemy and trying to keep your teams ships safe as well.Get This game.",1

1569,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"A hearthstone clone with a great ""manga style"" design : there are some good and new ideas on mechanics plays (like evolve), the different class are pleasant to discover and playing when you start.It's pleasant to start, because they give you many boosters.The interface on PC is not bad, but too similary to a android application.That's end the good part of my critics.It would be a great game, if only game developpers did'nt come crazy and create too many gamebreaker cards.The legendary cards, which you can have 3 exemplaries of the same in your deck, are too powerfull to be fun to play it or to play versus.The last extension ""Bahamut"" introduce some cards with totaly crazy power.  like seraphin statue (a havencraft card when destroyed return with a new incarnation, the fourth time it arrives, the havencraft player win the game) or like Daria, a runecraft creature who make draw 5 cards and reduce the cost of some drawed cards)At low lewel, in Versus game, you can play versus player who have already the tier 1 deck with : crazy runecraft who draw with extrem quickness their cards and play for 0 ""mana"" with a card who give them a new turn, the swordcraft or forestcraft who unleash hordes of creatures, too quickly to survives.In one year of existence, the game is at a so high madness level, which you can think that it will be very difficult to create some new cards which can't be like ""You win if you draw it"".In his developpment, this game seems to me very similar to a dead CCG from Ubisoft : Duel of champions : each new extention introduced more and more powerfull cards and if players wanted to play and won, they must bought many boosters from last extension to have the legendary.At this rate, in one year, i think and i fear that Shadowverse CCG will have the same issue than Duel of Champions.

1231,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2015.0,"Although often feeling like a micro-transaction dominated world, LOTR has done what it can to survive in the changing climate of MMOs. The game will eventually require money to be spent in order to progress meaningfully and also to reduce frustrations in basic gameplay aspects such as gold caps and inventory slots. Despite it's repetetive enemy models and requirement for endless travelling, LOTR really shines in bringing Tolkien's world to life. The game has very accurate depictions of characters and tales from the mythology, whilst providing an outstanding feeling of immersion through a beautiful soundtrack and carefully crafted environments. Some of its systems such as music composition and housing make it one of the best MMOs out there for atmospheric and paced gameplay.",1
2237,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,"I would say one positive thing about this game, and that would be that playing this game allowed me to learn that the only way to earn card drops in free to play games is by spending money on them, something I absolutely refuse to do for this, ""Game.""  It infuriates me to no end that there is enough of a demand and market for these kinds of non-games that this even exists.  I just don't get how people want to stare at a screen while they click rapidly in order to achieve so little, let alone in a variation like this where you quickly become so ineffectual at clicking that it turns into an idle game.  That it tries to turn a profit for doing so little by making this into an adult game is a travesty, but people are tossing some money their way that it was probably worthwhile for them to do.  Makes you wonder why you even bother working a normal job when you can get paid to make something like this, which I'm sure is a programmer's wet dream of simplicity.  That's about as close to being sexually interested in this game as I'll ever get.",0

1712,SMITE®,2016.0,"Smite changed every bit of how I feel about MOBAs. I first got this game on xbox after a few of my friends tirelessly convinced me to download it. I hated MOBAs because of LOL and its toxicity in the community. LOL personaly I could not play and feel good after a match and I made the mistake judging all MOBAs off these bad experinces. I got so involved on SMITE I ended up building a PC to join the PC side of SMITE, Xbox took way longer to get updates and I felt I would have a better competive experience on PC. Between both I believe I am sitting at +500 hours.My PROS:- Community is better than any other competive mutiplayer I have seen- Way less clicking than LOL- Perspective (3rd Person)- Lore of Gods- Hi-Rez is good with ways to get free Gems (In game currency that you can also buy)- God Pack to buy all gods and future gods (Saved me alot of grind time)- Hi-Rez is really interactive with the community (Via Twitter)My CONs:- Ranked system still needs some tweaking- Needs a better ""report player"" system and harsher penaltys for DC/AFK'sThat is just a few I can think off the top of my head.Hi-Rez really has something here and am happy to see it grow.",1
12800,Brawlhalla,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewWhat can I say about Brawlhalla? Fun and entertaining as long as you're playing with your friends and not going to play rankeds to get the highest rank on the leaderboard while using experience from any other fighting game. I'll be talking mainly about mechanics and the game in terms of competitive, ranked matches.Someone metioned it already, but I just have to write about this. Dodges and wall camping are mechanics that basically hinder the pleasure that can come from playing this game. Dodges are meant to allow you to be invincible for one attack and to have a big cooldown. However, it doesn't work like that in a practice. People found a lot of ways to give themselves low cooldowns on dodges, making them invulnerable to most of the attacks and all of what they'll be doing is staying passive for the whole match and punishing you for the approach. Wall-camping is another thing that can raise your frustration to the level where it's twice the size of Canis Majoris (google it up). I take a guess that most of the people will think I'm talking about people camping on the edge of the platform just to finish the enemy when they come nearby the wall of a platform. Well, if you're one of those people, you're wrong. Wall-campers are people that hold on to the wall like their life depends on it. They'll be annoying with you by standing on the platform for less than a second just to come back. Before it was even worse because they didn't have to stand on the platform because the wall was all they needed to recover the jumps, dodges and recovery attacks, but one update forced wall-campers to start standing on the platform, but it's still not enough to fight this plague.However, there's a glimpse of hope for ranked matches. Developers are working on new mechanic and changing the existing one. Dashes are going to be introduced and dodges strongly nerfed. Dodges will have bigger cooldown and the duration of it. Apart from that, there won't be anything like momentum dodge (dodge that can be done right after landing a hit or when running full speed) and because of that, chain dodges (series of momentum dodges that can be done by pressing dodge button shortly before the finish of the first or second dodge) are also going to disappear. In place of them, dashes are going to be introduced and, hopefully, it will punish the passive-floating people from doing so.Unless you want to play rankeds like me and spend some time (read: 463 hours) playing it just because none of your friends wants to play with you, I recommend it to you! It is perfect when you want to play with your friends, gaming part of the family or FFA because there's almost no possibility you're going to meet people that will be passive.",1

10182,theHunter Classic,2016.0,As of me typing out this review i have been playing for 3 weeks and i have to say the devs of this game have come a long way and yes the there might be a few bugs here and there the devs work their butts off to fix them as fast as they can.In this review i would like to pint out a few things(1) Yes you do need to pay money to actually be able to hunt the majority of the species but i would like to point out that in order to hunt in real life you need to buy a license as well.(2) Just like in real life hunting you need to take your time and be patient in order to drop that big buck or bull you might have been tracking. In no way shape or form will you just get that big buck or moose in the first few minutes of you joining a server. This game focuses on developing skills such as spotting and tracking and the more these skills are developed ingame the more proficient you become as a hunter just like you would IRL.(3) This game will appeal more to those who truely respect and/or love for the great outdoors. So therefore if you treat this game as a real life hunt you wont even notice you are actually playing a game.overall thoughts on this game:fantastic simulator that should be given a score of 10/10,1

From 2007 until now and forever :).It is the best MMORPG I have played and it has a special place in myself.It is basically an adventure game , free world exploration , but of course you need to pay so you can have a lot of adds in the game , with which you cant level to the level cap ( max level )I recommend this game to everyone who appreciates the hard work of Turbine. (Now Standing Stone Games)I`ve played it since 2007 and it gets much better as the years pass by...A lot of people say this game gets worse as the years go by , but it`s not true.I have over 1500 hours played by my characters and I dont regret even a minute played in this game.It`s a neverending adventure for any player who presses the ''Play'' Button and experiences the world of Middle Earth.I hope you`ve enjoyed my review , thank you . :)",1

114,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewHonestly This game Is a great concept and visually it works. There is alot to be said that is good about such a game, the voxel based construction and all its great its wonderful, but that is where it stops.The developers have repeatedly and continuously turn the game on its head since I started playing (before it was on steam) yes some changes arguably are and were merited but in general they have made many poor decisions and continue to keep making poor decisions. The game has been out well over a year and they claim they are still ""One step Closer to Beta"" as they launch their latest patch of poor decisions. These recent patches like most of the others have affected balance, destroyed the matchmaking system, and uterly decimated the economy. Expect to play 200-400 matches to build a fully functional robot with matching parts. Free-Jam does not admit to their mistakes, fix problems ,or even really listen to the community that despite disagreeing still want to see the game to succeed and come to fruitionIf you have been playing this game for awhile yeah you can still occasionally have fun as you already have the parts and the game-play and building still retains most of its appeal. But if you are new to the game I suggest looking elsewhere, you  are in for lots of seal clubbing by more experienced/better armed players, and rewards from battle that will keep you the unfortunate prey for many many many games to come.Maybe some day the Devs will mature and the game will stabilize, but until then I cannot recommend this game.",0

Hope it sticks around.  Either way I feel it is worth playing.  The sidekicking system makes it easy to play with others both higher and lower level than you are.  Tons of fun and I love all the funny lines in the world.  makes fun of hero comics while being a hero game at the same time.My favorite line from an NPC is :  I don't trust heroes that why I carry Heat!.

3528,Dota 2,2016.0,"If you're looking for a highly competitive game that won't feel the same every match even after thousands of hours of gameplay. This is the game for you. This takes a lot of time to master, the learning curve is quite steep, which would sometimes put off casual gamers but would be a very big plus for competitive ones. Though not as newbie friendly as the rest of the MOBA games out there, this game has always been the epicenter of the MOBA genre.The community is the little downside here. I guess the competitiveness leaves room for sympathy for those new to the game. Even the slightest bit of mistake can put off any player on your team. With that in mind, play this game with that in mind, so you'd have extra patience when playing online matches. I suggest you invest in hundreds of hours of bot matches first if you're new to the MOBA genre. This game won't grow old on you, I swear. I know it hasn't on me.",1
9100,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,"I made my Steam account specifically for TF2 back in the day, and there was a long time I'd just play this game for 8 hours every day of the week. I loved TF2 to death, I can still remember how happy I was when I first found a hat or when I uncrated something good. The best part, though, was the frequent and amazing updates this game brought out. It seemed every month we got new weapons or maps. Halloween used to be absolutely fantastic, every year you'd have some amazing new map and gamemode with a horde of halloween items to earn. Christmas usually added new weapons, summer added all sorts of stuff, plus just general huge updates and events. It was great.Those days are completely gone though. This year we didn't get a halloween update, we didn't get a christmas update and the team has been making some really weird choices for the game lately. Competetive was basically dead on arrival, it was broken for months after release too, and casual games have been changed to be a lot less casual. I feel like the team has no idea what they're doing, if they're even doing anything at all. The last fun thing they attemped was a class war between pyro and heavy, in which the winner would get new content, but even that was utterly lackluster. The war itself was just a meter filling up, until pyro won, and that's that. What about the new content for pyro? Pretty sure they forgot about it, and even when it comes it'll likely be completely broken. Team Fortress 2 just feels dead. In the haydays it was incredibly lively, something was happening every day, there was so much I hadn't even tried yet. Now nothing ever changes, if it does it's for the worse and every seasonal event is utter disappointment.I have no idea how this game can have almost the biggest playerbase on steam, bring in one of the highest revenues on steam and be so captivating that everyone I know has over a thousand hours clocked, yet still have such a tiny and unqualified dev team. I know it must be disheartening for the people who work on this to see die-hard fans like myself berating them like this, but they must know that they're failing the fanbase. I know of a modded server run by two people that push out ten times the content the official developers do, and it's better quality too. Step up your game.",0

7900,PlanetSide 2,2015.0,"I like this game for many reasons. First off the gameplay is awesome you can have diffrent customizations, such as diffrent camo's, amor, and weapons. There are multiple classes that you can play as, and when you are that class you feel like you are a part of a team because every single class is used alot through out gameplay alot and being that class requires you to do your job or your team can epicly fail and get killed. And the maps are huge and plenty of room to have multiple big battles going on at once (if not paying attetion to the map) without you realizing it. Also what i love about this game is its not always about who has the better guns and vehicles. It matters how well you work with your team and get♥♥♥♥♥♥done. Ive been playing this game for a while now and believe me, ive faced a battle were the odds where 3 to 1 but we won due to communication that this game does so well at making, and how well we played together.

9812,Elsword,2016.0,"I've played this game over a small handful of years and it's a game that one can have fun, but it can get really repetitive after a while. There is newer jobs throughout the times I've played the game, but they seem to throw a veil over the previous classes. (Do disregard the hours. I've played for a while mostly on the non-steam client.)= - = - = Positives = - = - =Fun with Friends:Honestly, this game can give several hours of banter and being idiots on the game. I can't normally play this game without others playing it, especially after a while of playing. Stamnia Bar:While this may limit progress, it does give you a good steady progress of leveling and not overdoing it. I've played games for 10+ hours in a row because stamnia bars weren't included or implemented and end up blowing my entire day on a game. There is ways around it with events or the cash shop, but you don't have to push it. You'll normally spend up to 3 to 4 hours, at most, straight with grinding before you'll run out.Consistent Events:This is the only thing that curttails the whole cash cow complex of this game. You need to cash in on these events, especially if they give out some lucrative items (like Stamnia Potions or Cash Shop Gear) throughout the duration. There is hardly any time where they don't have less than two events running at the same time.= - = - = Negatives = - = - =Cash Cow / Pay-2-Win Complex:This feature right here can kill a game, especially when it's tied into the game to hinder progress towards end game content. Sure, the clothes may seem nice, but they come with stats and without those--you'll be spending countless hours trying to get around it. This has been a problem for not a few months, but years actually with little-to-no resolution.  Alongside, some of the things in the shop, especially with the gear, Class Rebalancing Needed:Many of the newer classes would end up being the trend, especially when someone's been apart of the game for a while. Even if a nerf comes across, it takes many weeks to months before they actually resolve the overpowered class with a patch. I can't play some of my classes now, because they just fall off compared to newer classes.Consistent Repetitiveness:For the majority of the game, all you do is run into dungeons, kill things, and there you go. You can go out into the field and kill field bosses and trash mobs, but they don't give essential experience unlike what dungeons give you. This was a main killer of the game's attention towards me and end up quitting for weeks to months at an end.= - = - = Verdict = - = - =I have to get it a negative rating barely because this game has hardly ever kept my attention for more than a week. Don't get me wrong, this game is fun and all--yet, there's many mechanics in the game that either gets boring really quick or requires you to dump real-life cash to achieve end-game status. If you're a person that doesn't mind tossing some green around to get boosted into end-game, then by all means--go ahead. However, if you're a person that's barely making it paycheck-to-paycheck or don't have the money to toss around, then I highly don't recommend this game without putting limitations on purchasing things.",0

2540,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,"Some folks are going to hate on this because I like this game Unironicly. No, I don't consider this a Hentai game. This is a hentai game in about the same way that the moon is made of cheese. From a distance, someone uneducated could percieve it to be true, but it's just not. At most it's Ecchi, but the scantily clad anime women don't actually undress, pose in any manner that is remotely provocative, or try to make romantic advances on the player. The moaning and whining sounds risque at best, but you'd have to be severely innocent to be able to get an honest fap out of this game. Yes, the game does move at a slow crawl, but it's an idle game. It plays it's damn self when you close it, and then you come back to it. And you do other things. Nothing terribly new here. Some folks complain about a lack of monster variety, but I'm guessing they only played a few minutes, and never got to higher levels where things like dragon girls, harpies, and bunny girls start to show up. Perhaps the pacing for revealing new monster types is too slow for folks? It's meant to be slow. Found it fun to play while doing a lot of other things, which I am pretty sure is the intent. The different moans, while amusing, do run a bit old after a while. Thankfully there are options to silence everything if you want to. There are in game purchases, but they don't in any way affect the gameplay, which actually strikes me as a very honest free to play model. Buying outfits is not to enhance the gameplay: it's strictly there to support the developer, and you don't have to do it to enjoy pretty much everything the game really offers you.I'll probably unlock everything on this game over a period of a month or two, like with Clicker hero, before I get bored of it.The game may also have interesting updates in the future.

All I can say is that Pay2Win business models are always a bad idea and it sucks that this game has gone this way. Once I would have said to buy some stuff because of how well they where handling the microtransaction system and give them a fair shake but now that they've gone full Ebenezer Scrooge I have to say that you shouldn't give them a single cent.

The sounds and the graphics are nice, the gameplay is quick and satisfying and honestly, it's nice to play Team Death Match again. With all the Battle Royal and Overwatch styled objective shooters trending, it's nice to turn off your mind for a bit and just shoot people. It really brings me back to the reason I started playing shooting games in the first place. Just fast paced gameplay where all you need to worry about is killing and being killed. I like that you can get all the guns without spending any money, though if you want to look cool with a skin, you might have to shell out quite a bit. The drop rate in the loot crates is god awful at the moment, I'm hoping the chances get better to give us at least a little hope.Also, not that important, but it would be cool to be able to make a few changes to your character model other than straight replacing it with acompletely different character. To get a little variety and personalization going.It's nice to have the choice to mute team/all chat for when you really just don't want to hear any of it. It gives players the change to say what they want in chat without bothering people who dont wan't to be involved in trash talk/offended, since they can just perma mute chats.Overall I have def. enjoyed the game so far and will continue playing long term most likely.

Obviously, this was a bit of a rough patch with alot of bugs, hence alot of negative reviews around this time, thus the mixed rating.However, SparkyPants are through the rough patch, which actually only lasted 1-2 months and are now putting out new content (new cards), they have also been fast to fix bugs.  In fact, actually did pretty good handling changing devs and re-writing the entire client.The have just released a mini-expansion 11 new cards, are back to producing 1 new monthly card for ranked rewards per month and a new major exapnsion due soon, the Isles of Madness.  The new 12 cards from SparkyPants look really good cards as well and fitted really well into alot of decks I have, so good going there too.ESL has always been a excellent ccg, with a epic feel to it and based on the excellent Elder Scrolls universe / lore.  You can create some amazing decks, items / equpment and movement across the 2 lanes can be awesome to behold and give ESL are far more dynamic, exciting ccg experience.  Also, its very generous rewards wise and there are cheap decks you can put together without epics / legendarys, you can also buy pre-built decks with gold, which contain epics / legendary cards to get you started.I have played alot of other ccgs and ESL is very, very good.

I played it only because everybody around me was playing it but facts didn't let me play it anymore. Facts:1. I spend HUNDREDS if not thousands of euros simply by gambling with skins. This game got me addicted to gambling. I already played poker in casino and stuff but i never felt that i need to go back there again until now. 2. Community is so toxic that you need to completely ignore it in order to play the game. Muting everyone except people you know in real life was always needed in this game. 3. Recent ranking system update. In this update valve let people feel how bad they are. If you let somebody achieve third best rank in game it means he is good and then you just send him back somewhere between mid-ranked people just because he didnt played the game for few weeks. Its insane how valve is forcing people to play they're games in last few weeks. 4. Overwatch: Now this one is an example of BIG MISTAKE. You cant just give other player ability to perma ban you. But valve gave this ability to gold novas (7-12 years olds). I decided to do a bit of experiment: I deranked my account all the way to gold and started smurfing.

5505,DCS World Steam Edition,2018.0,"Bought this around 6 months ago, and although i'm only 56 hours in, i've barely scratched the surface of this highly detailed and realistic sim.I've been a flight sim fan since Microsoft released FS2002, my main focus being helicopters. FSX came along and made helicopter flight simlulation much more realistic, but it still wasn't quite there. Then I tried XP10 and was blown away by the realism and immersion I experienced with helicopters. The physics and flight dynamics were incredible.Then, I discovered DCS World. First thought: ""Just another flight sim. Probably like CFS3."" Which is fine. After all, I enjoyed CFS3 when it first came out. But, again, it was still lacking realism somewhat. And since DCS is free, I thought I would give it a try.And that's where I got sucked in!So if a simulator is free, you'd generally expect it to be a bit crap, right? Wrong! Although I had only just acquired the sim, the level of detail, flight dynamics, physics, sounds and effects far surpassed anything I had previously experienced with other sims. As a beginner, this isn't a title you can just ""get in and go"" with. You need to take time to read through the manuals and familiarise yourself with the contents and features. There's also a plethora of helpful videos and tutorials on the web.First thing I did was install one of my all time favourite helicopters: the Mil Mi-8. A Soviet icon, aviation legend, and in terms of a DLC pack, obviously deserving of its own review.Fully clickable and comprehensive cockpits, real world startup and shutdown procedures, random failures, highly detailed models, and the ability to fully create and edit missions (and even entire campaigns) makes this the best flight simulator I have experienced to date. The fact it also has a VR branch really puts it into a class of its own in my opinion, as it really puts you in control, whether you're flying for fun, or trying to evade anemy fire as you line up for another bombing run!Free flying will allow you to take in the sights, especially if you have the likes of the new Persian Gulf map installed. I always spot a new detail each time I take a free flight. The maps are relatively small for a flight sim, but still more than big enough for you to spend some serious time exploring.If heavy combat is more your thing, then you'll find plenty to keep you busy! Take your targets out, or end up bailing out!Of course, this isn't JUST about air combat. You'll find plenty of targets on the ground and at sea, depending on missions/campaigns available.There really is something for everyone in this sim, and it's clear from the outset that the developers really have put a ton of effort into producing what I believe is THE best flight/combat sim currently available, and since it's free, there's really no excuse not to try it is there! :)",1
5549,theHunter Classic,2014.0,"This game is not good. I played this game and I sat around looking for animals and even when I found one some random dude would say ""WAIT !! You cant shoot that! You dont have a license for it!"" And sometimes I would find bunnies that when I shoot them got to do nothing with at all. All I got to do was stare at its dead body laying in grass. I mean sure its realistic and all but you also have to pay EXTREME amounts of money just to have fun. Pretty much this is what you do in the F2P version: Start at a chosen camp. Look around the world and look at beautiful empty woods/forests/swamps. Next thing you know is that you find some poop laying on the floor and some deer tracks. Follow the tracks. Find the deer and watch it either run away in fear or just point your gun at it and listen to some random dude say you dont have a license for that!

13441,Dota 2,2013.0,"Great MOBA. If you're into MOBAs like League of Legends, Smite, HoN, etc, then give this a try. It's free! And it's DAMN GOOD.First off, a warning: you're going to suck. Oh, you have some experience with MOBAs? Oh, in that case, you're going to suck and getâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Dota 2 has a pretty long learning curve. Loads of heroes to choose from and heaps of items to go along. The training system is a precious help and introduces you to the last hits, denies, shopping for items and combining items, allows you to play with a few noob-friendly (not easy and not weaker than the other ones, mind you, just not that complicated to master in the early stages of the game) heroes to get you to feel the game's pace.From then on, you still have a lot to learn. Everybody can use ALL heroes for free and there's no advantage anyone has over you except their own experience in the game. But there are plenty of heroes to go around and until you've played them all (or played against them) at least once, you'll be feeling like a noob when you face one for the first time.Dota 2 is rather unforgiving when it comes to carries. You die, you lose time, experience and GOLD. And you need GOLD to buy items to allow you to carry. Not that easy for supports either. Most of them do have the uppoer hand on some carries on the early stages of the game, but you need to know them in order to take advantage of that. Also, your abilities' damage doesn't really scale all that well to late game, where the carries start to shine. There are dozens of ward spots, jungling tricks and control points you need to master. Every game's different. Lanes are pretty unpredictable at Dota 2. You can have 2-1-2, but you can have a 1-1-3, a 1-2-2, or, if you have some jungler, you can have 1-1-1-2 os something like that. The game's pretty dynamic. Do check some guides and builds. They can help you in your first contacts with some heroes. But, hey... it's Dota 2. Everything's situational. Sure, there are a few core items on many heroes, but, all in all, it all depends on the game you're playing and a change can make ALL the difference.Again, if you're into MOBAs... Do try it. NOW!",1

2778,Star Trek Online,2014.0,"Star Trek Online (STO) is a solid MMORPG with tons of customization option for those who are willing to work for it.  It is not, however, a good Star Trek game.  For me, the main draw of Star Trek isn't so much the science fiction, which let's face it, is on the silly side.  It is the characters, the dynamics between the crew that makes it interesting.  In-game, however, crew members are treated as little more than equipment, so that personal connection is gone.  You gain the ability to customize your officers however you want, true, but you lose what makes them characters.Another problem of the game is the randomly generated sidequests.  Sure, it's fun to pretend that you are the star of your own Star Trek show, routinely investigating strange species, artifacts, and negative space wedgies, but the mad-lib style of quest generation means that after a while, all these quests seem to blur together.  So aside from the story quests - which are well done, by the way - none of the other content is memorable.The saving grace for these sidequests is the Foundry, which allows users to create their own quests and stories.  Sturgeon's Law is in full effect here; 90% of the custom content is lackluster, but the other 10% makes it worthwhile.While the game has problems that prevent it from being truly great, I would still recommend it for MMO gamers.  The universe feels big, the ship-to-ship combat is frantic but tactical (although sometimes you fight with the UI more than the enemy), and the amount of reference to the Star Trek shows can make Star Trek enthusiasts giddy.  If these sound exciting, that this is the game for you.",1

There is also a different section of other things such as: Bones, cars and AFVs. When I first tried this game I thought that since its free, it would be sh*t, but after only a few minutes of playing I found that it actualy is a very good simulator/teaching tool. This game has been very beneficial to me, in helping me understand everything about guns and all kinds of different guns, for when I fully enter my career and now have a huge leg-up.

19824,PlanetSide 2,2015.0,"So far, this is the closest game I have seen that actually resembles all-out war. Massive amounts of players, all attacking each other at the same time, each with different sides, strategies and weapons. Pretty good maps, as well. The classes seem rather basic at first, but then there are all the different weapons, upgrades, abilities and strategies that can be used with each one. A (seemingly) very well thought out game. It also incorporates the social aspect of gaming, by allowing the creation of outfits, platoons and squads.My only problems with it are the not-so-brilliant graphics, mainly the player models, and the fact that a great deal of in-game items require game currency that needs to be purchased for real money, or a lot of farming (can you farm PCs, or is it an NPC-specific thing?).

4322,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI really, really want to like this game. If it weren't for a glaring issue, glaring so brightly the devs apparently can't see it, I would heartily recommend it.The issue is the mechanics around mulligans, draws and power/influence. Essentially, at least 25% of the time, the game will be over before you have a playable hand. Since your opponent is in the same position, that means half of games are decided not by the quality of your deck, your play or interactions, but by the game ♥♥♥♥ing you or your opponent over before one of you even gets a chance. That's worse than Hearthstone.The games where you do actually get to play meaningfully can be quite good, so it has that going for it.Edit: with the latest patches, even the games where you don't get mana screwed are now utter♥♥♥♥♥♥In a naked attempt to over-monetise, they introduce a massively and obviously overpowered card, and have since refused to nerf it, leading to basically every deck being a removal pile.

To put it simply, the netcode is absolute trash.  Minor connection hiccups that cause 1-2 second lag spikes in other games will cause this game to immediately drop its connection and force you back to the login screen, and often it will take several minutes and multiple attempts to reconnect.  Unless you have a top-tier, highly reliable internet connection, STO is simply unplayable outside of very limited off-peak hours.  If you have fantastically reliable internet, go ahead and give STO a try.  Otherwise, don't waste your time.  It's not worth the frustration.",0
8377,PlanetSide 2,2015.0," Planetside 2 On a planet with similar climate properties as earth, there are 3 factions fighting over multiple facilites in territories (regions) in which they can annex and capture and expand their grasp of the surface area in these 4 continents that are snow, desert, forest, and swamplike environments. The game spans to thousands of people per server, resulting in a massive battlefield atmosphere.. Classes, Fleets of gunships, convoys of tanks, platoons of troops etc. The gameplay itself is solid, with bulletdrop on many weapons and movement being comparable yet sub-par. For example, you can scale sides of cliffs of infantry while standing on nothing but thin air. But that doesn't bother me at all, because doing that gives me an advantage for good sniping spots. Moving onto the dynamics... this game is FREE-TO-PLAY! Which is great, having any one of my friends just hop in and play. There are 15$ month memberships and bundles where the per month price decreases the more you subscribe.. And there is also the daybreak cash premium currency, this is mostly useless unless you wish to buy decoratives or armor for your character, and new camos. But everything else that actually affects gameplay can be acquired by Certs (In-game credit points) for every 250 experience you earn. For the graphics and optimization of the game... The game itself is poorly optimized but if you do run it at highest settings it does look pretty damn good. On my gtx 460 i ran it at straight up medium settings with about 35 fps, but now with a gtx 970, it is absolutely amazing at max. Now to summarize this game up, it is a must download and try out for sure.. deff the best MMOFPS i've played, and when it was first released in 2012, i thought it was ahead of it's time, and in some aspects it still is. There may be a feel of repetition and grinding when you're playing by yourself, but once you get a great group of friends going you'll find yourself putting countless hours into the game.",1
10968,Digimon Masters Online,2016.0,"Absolute garbage.I went into this expecting to enjoy it despite the negative reviews as I enjoy the Digimon World games and the battle system is sort of comparable to that but don't even bother.It's shoddily made. The text looks like it was thrown into Google translate and not cleaned up as there's random punctuation thrown in (I had a question mark next to Kunemon's description when I hatched it) and some sentences are worded so poorly which can affect how the game works. I'm still not 100% on how most of the mechanics thrown at me work. I've also been stuck in invisible barricades because the devs don't seem to know how to program hit boxes. There are stairs in the second area that I walked up and got stuck on.The controls are awkward. Instead of standard MMO controls, you use either WASD or the mouse to move. The arrow keys do not move the camera at all but instead you have to hold down right click and move the mouse which is awkward. You also have to double click to interact with everything rather than just right click. The only thing they got right was the mouse wheel zooming in and out but that also feels off.Gameplay is awful. You do not feel involved at all. The balance is also stupid. There's a mission where you have to fight 3 Drimogemons and a ""leader"" Drimogemon which is slightly bigger than the regular ones. The problem is that the leader is too powerful for a starting mission and the fact your Digimon's HP regens so slowly is ludicrous. You can't switch to another Digimon either as they'll have the same amount of HP gone as the one you just usedOther gripes include not being able to customise your avatar so you're stuck with 4 presets, lack of choice in starter Digimon, really loud sound effect for your Digivice and the community I was seeing being either toxic or spammy.Don't bother. Just play any other Digimon game out there.",0
6442,Fishing Planet,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewSeems like a great game hidden behind a lot of BS.  It starts you off with a nice tutorial, nice homesite to get you going, and show you the game's potential.  Then it not only leaves you clueless on how to continue but traps you so that you will be broke and paying real money to just even be able to continue playing.  Learning curve, no such thing, you'll run out of money long before you learn it.  Watch lots of youtube vids, read guides, helps a little, but most of them are outdated to the ""better"" times of the game past where you're not a mistake away from losing most of your money.  Only 2 ways to play this game, pay a lot of real money, or watch/read a ton of guides, then prepare to grind the same fishes over and over so you don't become broke and can actually ""progress"".  From watching past vids of how the game used to be, I can see that anything that might've made the game even possible to play casually, and not grindy, has been removed.  All I do is catch the same fishes over and over, because when I try to fish another area, get equipment necessary to catch other fish, catch other fishes for fun, I simply can't keep up with the money I'm losing.",0

4618,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"Let me start by saying I used to frequent this location often. The service is normally great and on any other day of the week I could expect to enjoy myself and feel happy about leaving a sizable tip.However, since the new change in management, the once delightful and competent staff has disappeared. I can only suspect this is because the new owners are as unbearable as the people they hired to replace the old staff.To say the new waiters and ""chefs"" are unbearable is an understatement. The new managers must have hired their own kids and the brainless friends of their children. When my family and I went in this evening for dinner, no one moved to greet or seat us until about 15 minutes after we arrived. I spotted the hostess chatting away with some man at the bar. I eventually cleared my throat and asked ""Is it seat yourself, today?"" Then this horrid expression developed across her face as she turned around and said ""Actually no, it's not."" She proceeded to talk for another minute before waltzing over to us. After scratching her♥♥♥♥♥in front of me, my wife, and our three children, she picked up only two menus and brought us to one of the dirtiest tables in the house. Looking at the menu, I could see her greasy handprint remaining.Twenty minutes later, a waitress approached us, did not say a word, started writing on her pad, and then just walked away. She came back 5 minutes later with five glasses of water, none of which had ice. She blankly threw down almost every straw she had and then walked away again.Five minutes after that, another waitress came out. This time, she actually greeted with a cheerful smile and asked us how we were doing this evening. When we inquired about the hostess and the first waitress, she apologized profusely and said that they are in the middle of training a lot of new staff. She assured us next time we come back we can expect better service. She got us more menus, wiped down the table, and got us a pitcher of ice water for the table. Things finally seemed to start turning around.After we placed our order, we sat and noticed the renovations they made to the restaurant. The carpets were new, there was music playing, and the tables, when clean, were quite comfortable. For a moment, we thought were in the clear.Just as quickly as our opinion of the change started to improve, it was ruined again. We heard shouting from the kitchen area among the staff. Several people (who sounded quite young) were shouting ""Do it, do it!"" Immediately I was alarmed. There were not many people seated at the restaurant. I could only assume they were doing something horrible to our food.Our food came out as soon as the shouting stopped. The first and second waitress and the hostess came out to deliver our food, all of them hiding a grin.My wife looked alarmed. My children were oblivious. I said ""Thank you,"" but they didn't walk away. My wife was about to bite into her tuna salad sandwich, but I stopped her. I picked up it and opened it. The three standing beside our table started looking nervous.""Something wrong, sir?"" The second waitress asked.""I suppose we're going to find out,"" I responded. I opened my mouth and took a bite of the sandwich. Most languages don't have the words to concisely describe the taste, but it tasted like rot with an overwhelming amount of salt.I spat up the food immediately. I stood up, pushed the three aside, grabbed my family and left. The manager heard the commotion and made his way to us. I can't believe myself, but I simply gave him the middle finger, right in front of my children, and proceeded out of the restaurant. In the car ride home, I kept wincing at the aftertaste. It was strangely familiar; it was driving me crazy trying to think of what they might have put in it. I considered going to the emergency room in case it was a poison of some sort. I didn't go to see a doctor and felt fine after a shower and something to eat from home. I longed for the old owner and staff. I detested the vindictive people who were currently at that restaurant. I wish the best for those old waiters and waitresses who got out of there while they could. In the end, the whole thing just left a bad taste in my mouth, but not nearly as bad as the one left by Team Fortress 2.",0

11387,War Thunder,2018.0,"Indeed, even though I've got almost a 1000 hours logged (not even including the many hours playing this outside steam before it officially launched), I can't recommend War Thunder. Reason: the grind. It's horrible. It takes hundreds of hours to unlock higher tier tanks and planes, forcing you to grind or pull your wallet. The graphics are great, the gameplay is great (except for terrible balance issues) and it will hook you, but it would be better to avoid being hooked. A terrible waste of time. If the grind in the higher tiers was comparable to tiers 1/2 it would be a great game. But of course, that would mean many players will reach endgame, unlocking everything there is to unlock and potentially losing interest. Great for players, bad for Gaijin as every customer is a potential virtual opium addict, milkable of cash.It takes 1000s of dollars to unlock everything. A premium account only helps on lower tiers, you still have to grind xx-xxx hours on the highest tiers and that's the problem. Freemium isn't free. I'm all for forcing 'free to play users' to grind, but those that spend money on a premium account should notice a huge difference and that's clearly not the case. Spending 60 USD on a premium account + 1 vehicle unclock is but the tip of the tip of the iceberg. So even if you pay, it won't make a difference on higher tiers. The reaility is that it takes months, or weeks at 40+ hours a week using a premium account. That's just ridicilous. Got millions of convertable xp? Use it to progress faster! But pay 50 USD on top of that to be allowed to actually use it.There simply shouldn't be such a grind for paying users. Spending around 60 USD should give you a lot more bang for bucks. Paying 100 USD for a tank takes the fun away. Gaijin can do whatever they want, it's free, but the implementation is offensive to loyal, paying users. I'd happily spent my money on premium, but the difference is so small that I don't do so anymore.Every game, even those that hold a pricetag, should have a certain amount of grinding. The difference between free and premium progression is just too small to justify the price it takes to progress.",0

4978,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2018.0,"Back in the 1990s and early 2000s, you'd call this thing a 'free demo'. The amount of DLC is laughable, and they've naturally made sure that any car or track you'd reasonably recognise is DLC. So, assuming this game is priced at £51.99 for the full package, it's absolutely not worth it. The cars are not enjoyable to drive, the physics aren't particularly accurate, the UI for controllers is abysmal and the graphics while good in some places, are overall pretty poor at this price. Go and buy Assetto Corsa, you'll get better value for money.",0

4660,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014.0,"I must recommend this game, it is my duty as one who has spent 1600 hours on CSS (from xFire) and 500+ hours on CSGO. I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here's what I have to say about GO...CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc.It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of.Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me.",1

12455,PlanetSide 2,2016.0,"The learning curve's steep. For the first 10 hrs i was dying non-stop (maybe that happened because i just suck), but once you get the hang of it you'll really enjoy the game. I'm amazed to see such good quality for a Free-2-Play. And its actually F2P not Pay-2-Win.I played Light Assault most of the time (I like the jetpacks) but i can say for sure that every class feels different and unique. The guns are unique. Even guns that differ in only a few stats feel different. And that is Higby awesome :)But you need a good enough rig to play it. I had to upgrade to 8GB RAM to run it smoothly. Other than that, there's not much wrong.I see some people complaining about no interaction with the devs, so i guess thats kind of a con, but i dont care much about dev interactions.Final Word : I'm Addicted",1
13141,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewReal fun game. The first Battle Royale that motivates me to continue playing it. Not too much loot available, so gearing up can be challenging. But that's no problem as the map isn't filled with so many players. Also no cheaters met yet, seems like EAC and the matchmaking work pretty fine.Finding a game can sometimes take a moment, since there are not so many players yet, but hopefully it will get more popular in the future. Graphics are decent as well and it runs very very smoothly even on my old i7-2600k and a 390x at 2560x1080p.The kitchen and special items are a nice gimmick at least but don't affect gameplay too much. A real nice thing is, that while this game f2p, you can only buy cosmetic items that won't giye you any gameplay advantage over others.All in all a pretty fon game from the Battle Royale genre that is definitely worth a try.",1
6919,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewMana flood and mana screw ruin this game.There are of course mana fixing cards and creatures that help you ramp but you need to draw them or get lucky and have them in your opening hand.

Nothing worse than losing a game because you got to 10 power turn 5 or 6 and all you draw is mana for 8 straight turns, or your hand is full of 8 drops and you're stuck at 2 mana. Even aggro decks are not immune to flood and screw, it's very frustrating.",0
11915,Realm Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis is my 3rd updated review after the most recent patch. And again they make the game even worse. Warrior is extremely op and assassin is not far behind. Every single patch the game becomes worse and worse. Hi-Rez doesnt listen to the players at all and just does what ever they want. Game has not been fun since before the first patch and the player base proves that. Stop killing the game.,0
1189,War Thunder,2017.0,It's planes or tanks.  The plane sim is pretty poor.  For the price of a premium plane you can buy IL-2 1946 or cliffs of Dover.  Both are much much better.  So it's a no unless you have no money at all and want to get one shotted by fully upgraded fighters while your in a biplane.EditWARNINGThis game installs a hidden launcher on your computer.  You cannot view i9t through windows control panel and you can only get rid of it by manually deleting the registry.  Do not Download.  This game is basically a virus.,0

5129,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2016.0,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about Lord of the Rings Online. Released in 2007, this game has captured my attention since it was first launched with the title Shadows of Angmar. One of the last true RPGs found within the MMO genre, the game captivates with its art and design that still manages to impress nearly a decade later. Despite drawbacks in population, ownership change at Turbine (purchased by Warner Bros in 2010), and the launch of A Free-2-Play model shortly after, LOTRO still has a magical draw about it that compels players to take up arms against the Dark Lord and trek across Middle-Earth. The game is worth the subscription cost, especially if purchased for 3 or more months in advance. If unable to afford the fee, there is a Free option with limitations; just about all of which can be unlocked in-game through the use of Turbine Points gained from completing various Deeds, both kill, quest and reputation. In general, the community is helpful- much of the time willing to assist a newcomer with answers to their many questions. Give the game a try, it is perfect for the hardcore quester, casual gamer, role-player and explorer; something for just about everyone.",1

19568,Neverwinter,2016.0,I've just recently came back to Neverwinter because I was missing a MMORPG with good story and questing.  There is alot to love about this game.  The fighting mechanics are fun.  The graphics are not bad.  All the quests are voice acted.  So many mounts and companions to get.  So many races to choose from and Classes to play.  The leveling is fast.  There are dungeons to run.  There is someting going on every weekend.  You don't have to pay money to play and get items if you can't.  Most cash shop items end up in the auction house.  If you have the time and no money you can still get good mounts and companions.  There is so much to do in this game I felt overwhelmed when I started playing again.   I recommend joining a Guild using the Guild finder menue.  Now I have other players to help me when I have questions.   The guild Stronghold is great.  Your guild gets it's own instanced Keep and town with mobs to fight.  Everyone is leveled up to 70 in the SH so you can join in the events even if you are a lower level.  Random events happen in the SH area all the time.  If you are a small guild you can Alliance with bigger guilds and go to their SH and partisipate in the events with them.  Give this game a try.  It's Free to Play so why not.,1
2450,Bless Online,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is OK. Its not an MMORPG genre game saver or W.O.W killer but its a fun game. They have fixed some problems within the game and will continue to fix these problems (I hope). Don't let all the hateful comments because people got over-hyped deter you from trying this game. I only have 3hrs logged but this is my new main MMORPG. I hope this was helpful!,1
14447,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewGreat card game. No pay-to-win. Tons of cards are obtained through playing or crafting (all those I've seen at least).Not too casual like Hearthstone. Need reflection (and luck because of cards).,1
19424,Crush Crush,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAwesome idle game. Adorable, funny, and super meta. It's free, there's basically no excuse not to if you like anime chicks and idle games. It's slow to get started (quite a bit slower than Adventure Capitalist when it comes to prestiging) but it's totally adorable and funny. This is seriously the game I've been waiting for my whole life and never thought too hard about it.There are a couple typos throughout the game in repeated text. It can feel a little slow at times (duh).The numbers will have be tweaked in the long run. I used my date/time settings to cheat out to the 50 cap on all the skills and acquire a bunch of money/diamonds. At level 50 it takes like 3,000 days to upgrade a skill again and I'm pretty sure 10 years is a bit obscene. This is at approximately 34x multipllier, too, so I advise that the devs make it a bit more reasonable and set a cap on the length of time it takes for a skill to level up if they want to keep pepole interested. You literally need multiple hundreds of years to finish this game in full in the state its in now.Nobody will find out about how moist Pamu makes people otherwise.",1

I could go into the specifics, but there's really no need to. just play it, there's no cost to try it. do yourself a favor and stick with it for a while, the start is slow and can be overwhelming, but once you find yourself in the end game, 100+hrs in, with your skill gems, passive nodes, and equipment all clicking and turning you into a loot-farming ball of death, your understanding of what video game development is about will change forever.Chris Wilson, you're my hero",1
14578,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is how early access games should be done. start off with a mainly bug free game that has enough functionality to be playable for many hours and plenty of content place holders so people can easily see what is coming in the future.The graphics look amazing, especially at 4k, and it's amazing how many hours just disappear as you're sitting there hauling in the fish.The object of the game is quite simple. Catch fish to earn money, spend that on equipment to help you catch more/bigger fish to make more money. Get enough money to go to different places where there are different fish and repeat the cycle.If you like fishing sims then this is for you.

10906,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Adorable, but kind of scary class system where choices in class combinations appear to be permenant which I can see being a problem with certain choices being seen as non-viable by the general community. It reminds me of old-school jRPG's and Ragnarok Online. The sprite art style is awesome. Compatible with a controller. I can see this game having a lot of potential, as of right now I've only played for a couple of days, and the leveling/progression system seems pretty standard for an MMO, I think a game like this could benefit from a strictly skill-based system rather than level-gainining one which I can see potentially becoming very grindy.

8679,Trove,2017.0,"This is the most money demanding game I have ever found.  Basically you spend hours and hours of doing the same thing over.  Then the worse part, the luck.  If you wanna get something good dont expect it since everything has to be super rare forcing people to buy over priced packages.  Also if your trying to buy something that they dont have a pack for good luck.  The packs range from 10$ - 100$ there is very few 10$ packs though.  This game is P2W (pay to win) since everytime someone bought something in the 100$ packs they get something.  Although for those who bought a small pack that has like 1 - 10 super rare chest your not getting anything.  The best chance you got at getting something good is 75 chest.  I would not recommend this game since it demands so much time and work put in to it doing the same thing over and over.

1215,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,"Where do I begin:This game has severe,unreparable issues I will list a few major ones,and maybe convince you its not worth your time and avoid my mistake of dumping so many hours in this game.-The players base;the game is cross-platform with mobile device wich translates to a lower skillceiling and therefore subpar performance on behalf of the majority of players,expect at least 2-3 teammates out of 7 total to have a winrate below 50% and create terrible gameplay experience as they drive you to frustration.-Monetization schemes;not so long ago Wargaming included randomized lootboxes with on top of other money making schemes such as premium tanks sales,premium camouflages,events,premium ammunition,gold sales,individual and bundle tank sales,premium time,free XP,boosters(cooldown,xp,credits),cosmetic tank attachments and also not to mention partnerships with Sega(Valkyria Chronicles) and the Warhammer universe and the Girls und Panzer anime as in the form of including tanks specific to those universes and the monetizing them.Right now you can buy and AMX M4 49 premium tank for 75 euros,insane.-In 3.8 a currency named ”spare parts” was introduced that could not be earned in game and was necesarry for unlocking NINE SLOTS OF EQUIPMENT,the problems are as follows,it was hard to gain this said currency because it only dropped in small amounts after every battle and it wouldnt always be case that you received said currency.It could take up to a week or more to kit out a tier X tank,the unlock would not be instant and it happened after a certain interval(skippable with gold,premium currency) wich would increase with vehicle tier and the level of the equipment.This mechanic has been removed in the last update and now the unlock is instant and can be done with credits.-The ”Military honor” system;in theory a good idea,it allows you to rate the performance of a player at the end of match and also report flamers and persons who went AFK,the problem is that it became the #1 tool to abuse if you dislike a player,ex: I ammoracked ”Y” tank the instant response from the other guy would be ”Reported”,multiple ”infractions” lead to an undeserved BAN in many cases-The Meta;the meta favors big guns,TDs and heavy tanks its absolutely rage inducing trying to play tanks like the Leopard 1 and Bat-Chatillion in tier X when you lose more than half the hitpoints in one blow while trying to spot the enemy team and then get insulted and reported.The situation was so bad WG had to make adjustments to the matchmaker so you wouldnt get more than 4 TDs in a team.",0

19571,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017.0,"Hi my name is Graydon, and I would like to say I havent wasted over 1500 hours of my life on this game.So many things in this game are broken, and id reccomend to stay away from it alltogether to be honest.The ranking system of the game is the most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing I have ever seen. The ranking system is based about 99% on game wins. I play with people in this game to have fun. They may not be the greatest, but why should I be punished, and go DOWN in ranking if I get the most kills in the entire game, but overall my team is not able to pull through. The game is filled with hackers, and ""smurfs""(people playing in a ranking lower than their own). Even with ""prime"" people are still able to get around this. Before I played with friends I was at an average ranking of Master Guardian, now I am usually around low silver-low gold nova. Overall I think the ranking system is horrible.Next I would like to say the Cooldown system is absolutely horrible. I have gotten myself up to a week ban from killing friends which is fine for me. But I have been getting better- not killing any friends anymore. Now I am getting banned from kicking 1 person that was AFK, and said he was throwing. This was in my first game getting off of a week ban. Because of kicking 1 AFK teammate I am now banned for another week.The gameplay mechanics are alright, but occasionally luck can be your best friend.The community is extremely toxic, and I absolutely hate playing with random people. Hence why I play with friends.I would reccomend you stay away from this game, and avoid wasting your time and money.Thank You",0

You put out 4 guard guys so they miraculously have a card that removes guard from all enemy creatures and costs like 2 magicka.  They always have the exact cards to counter you even though the prior battle was a joke.

5525,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"Meet Your Match is a Mess of an update, but I believe that TF2 will pull through, like time and time before, again.Many balances have been for the better, and for the not as well thought out ones, underlying them lies a recognition of the true problem which a great step forward.TO all the minor class and weapon rebalances,I appreciated Spy and pyro buffs, Valve recognized that pyro and spy were underpowered.A Health buff for pyro (185) instead of or in addition to its DPS buff would be better suited to its current role in TF2 I believe however.Natascha and Huo Long were nerfed and buffed nicely.Sun On a Stick might actually see some use now (maybe).Other good rebalances include Widowmaker, Short Circuit, Disciplinary action, Eureka Effect, Overdose (As a Medic main, I get and like what Valve is trying to do here).The point I'm trying to make, is that from all the rebalances, one can see that Valve really is taking the time to understand how this game is played.With that in mind, here are some of the major problems I see and how Valve can fix them.Casual: It's a good idea, the only problem being it is no longer ""casual"".You cant join friends in the middle of a game anymore.And the servers they assign you to have terrible pings where I am.All the good players who like to mess around stopped playing and all the terrible players started tryharding.An easy way to fix this is bringing back the option to let you join casual in the middle of the game by looking through server list or the ""join game"" button and voting systems to extend current map/match-up.Comp: should be available for all players who have played above a certain amount of hours instead of just for those who paid for the game.If one or two hour farmers get through it wont matter because Valve could easily use their ranking system to pair people with similar skill levels together. If you arent good, doesnt matter how much you game the system, you're stuck at bottom.Comp needs class limits.Maybe 2 for each Assault class and one for each defense class and they could explain it as ""to keep the game dynamic"".(Read up on the metagame and watch some matches before you ask why)Medic speed buff is stupid. Increases survivability of medic, encouraging stalemates in comp (Medics feel safer, less urgency to push from winning team).Reduces the fun in playing Medic because you get to be sloppier in your positioning, less good at dodging which is basically all Medic is about.Scout did -not- need another buff (or whatever this was to scout)It sounds like it makes sense ""travel at the same rate of the player you are healing"" but it's actually really gimmicky, basically boiling down to ""heal scouts to go fast"" because they are only class faster than Medic.Despite the above, potential players, dont be put off. TF2 is still a miracle of a game: the chemistry between all the classes work so well, it is incredibly fun to play and getting good is really satisfying.Besides, there's always community servers to tide this over (cp_orange, jump maps, mge, 24/7 dustbowl hightower)",1
1168,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016.0,"If you are an OSX user, this may not be for you. Continuous and spontaneous crashes and other issues (including your aim being locked and you are dropped to 20fps) ruin the competitive experience. The random crashes don't seem to be as common for PC users for whatever reason. Recent updates to the Matchmaking system have now caused lower-ranked players (Silver and Gold Nova) to be continually matched with players with considerably more skill and experience, known as ""Smurfs"" to the community. While these ranking tweaks had good intentions, especially for highly-ranked players (Global Elite, SMFC etc.), they just seemed to amplify the smurfing problem to  a much greater extent. Smurfing ruins the competitive scene, especially for beginners and lower ranked players who have not yet been able to grow and learn to the extent of the experienced 'Smurfs'. While some may acclaim that Smurfing allows players to improve, by playing against players of greater skill, when you lose a gun battle to a smurf, round after round, you're forced to sit and spectate while you wait for the next round to begin. If you are most interested in watching the game instead of being able to play it, watching Professional CSGO tournaments might be your speed. It makes it hard to improve at the game when you are pummeled by a Smurf game after game, day after day.Besides this all, the millions of daily players cannot be wrong. Gameplay is fluent and heavily based on cooperation with teammates. CSGO gives a motivation to improve, to climb the Matchmaking ranks and become the best player you can be. Even the weapon skins add  a huge element to the game that is purely about a virtual economy for aesthetic customisations in-game.CSGO is an immersive experience, and is a great game to play with friends - a game to learn together and grow together to top the ranks of Competitive Matchmaking. However, every game has its flaws. Crashes, gameplay issues and smurfing are amongst the most heinous (and I haven't even touched on the cheaters). Overall, 400 hours of regular playtime speaks for itself, but major issues need to be addressed so that the game becomes more enjoyable for everyone, becomes a more competitive experience and the community can grow together in appreciation of the game.",1
18577,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewSummary:Played a couple hours and overall a pretty decent game. It is a little different from fishing games I remember playing in the past but it's not bad. At the start it was a bit annoying having the control map pop up while the tutorial was going. I think that it should have been less invasive and have a little bubble stating ""press F1 for controls"" or something like that. Also the control map has some faded lines pointing to the keys which are a bit hard to follow. I kind of feel like a noob but just a suggestion... If you catch a fish that is supposed to be a release under the license equipped maybe once you catch that restricted fish it should have a notice that fades away saying if you keep the fish you'll get fined. I messed up and kept 2 fish in New York on a basic license and it made me go negative and now I can't fish til tomorrow. I can see this game getting a little repetative over time once I have caught a majority of the fish. Otherwise it's pretty relaxing, just throw some music on in the background grab a beer (age 21+) kick back and cast out.Pros:Beautiful graphicsVariety of gear/fish/methods to catch themCommunication to others in server (chatting and notifications of fish caught)Cons:Looking around/movement is a bit floatyNeeds more clarity on license restrictions real timeI'll do a better review when I get more time in the game and have more knowledge about the game.",1

877,SMITE®,2018.0,"Oh boy, here we goI started playing SMITE during the Pre-Season, but the majority of my gameplay runs from Season 1, slowing down around Season 3. If I recall correctly, SMITE came to steam around Season 3, so my hours don't exactly show how much time I put into this game, but I digress. I used to really like SMITE, I don't want to turn this whole review into a nostalgia trip, but I do want to talk about some reasons why I thought this game was great, and what changed, making the game what it is now.When I started playing, so many things were different than today, and that's a good thing. Games should change, but I think Hi-Rez took this game in one direction, where the things I enjoyed were left behind on the other path. The Joust map changes really hurt. I played mostly Joust because I played with two friends, rarely four other people were around at the same time to play Conquest. When they changed the Joust map, we all kind of stopped playing. It's sad to say that release Bellona or release Ah Puch didn't bother me as much as the direction that the developers took their game in, releasing things like K-Pop Bastet, and that disgusting Skadi skin later on that thankfully I wasn't there to look at. The game lost it's charm, not mechanically, but communally. They decided to go down not just a path of cringey asthetic design, but also a path of boring game design. Removing Golden Bow ruined the fun of Mercury, building all crit and being able to clear a wave with your 1 was fun. Removing the original acorns ruined the fun of Ratatoskr, giving him  4  2 cool paths to take the character each game, making each game feel less one dimensional. I don't want to write a giant review and cry like a child the entire time, I'm sure the game is fun for some people now, but I feel that Hi-Rez pushed a game design choice that to me feels like a flaw. Also why hasn't Zhong Kui gotten a skin since Summer 2015?If I could turn back time to play through Seasons 1 and 2 again, I would. I'm sure that my opinion has changed just due to aging and the development of a taste, that SMITE is no longer a part of, but I wouldn't play the game in the state today. There were too many strange choices made by the team working on this game that left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Maybe new players will have fun with the game because they didn't get to experience any of the old, but Version 3.11 will always be the final nail in the coffin of SMITE for me. It's sad, because I see new patch notes, and I think about what the game would be if some changes were avoided. I guess only Gods know what could have been.",0

Too much grinding necessary. PvE is boring, seriously it is. Using auto duel is boring I wish they removed pve completely. Competitive decks change every time a new card pack comes out in the shop. High level pvp is quite boring since you will be using the same meta deck as your opponent. The grind from Legend 3 to King of Games is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

2046,Aura Kingdom,2015.0,"The terrain doesn't work / you can walk over anything or clip into walls or buildings, except for places blocked by an invisible wall, they are everywhere. As for the graphics, it' old WoW style but in anime world, not 2015 next gen stuff, It'd be ok if it would be a game from 2008. The sound effects are poor, or nonexistent. The game often refuses to play sound while I talk over Skype. The whole thing is full of bugs. The actual gameplay is point and click with WASD movement, like any other classic mmo. You can progress quickly between the levels by completing the same sets of quests on different maps. It is really boring. You do get a ""pet"" at the start that you can talk to to some extent which is nice. This could be the sole reason to play this but getting the cool ones is impossible unless you have turbo luck(which you don't), a lot of cash(you could spend that on a better game) or you're planning on playing for like half a year(y u cereal?!).  For the first few hours the models were actually cute, all 20 of them. Later they get recolors or resizes to keep the game fresh and new.The Very Positive user reviews is a joke. Feel free to play this just for the cute anime style and silly fanboys. Just dont expect to get a satisfying gameplay experience.One more thing is that it's an Aeria Games title. That basically means that the content is years  behind the original (Frontier Online), the cash shop is expensive and the game urges you to spend cash for everything. For the small amount of PvP it has (no open pvp just arena and duel), you'll be flattened without a heavily buffed character, which you acquire the same way as eidolons(the pets). I reached level 60 in two days. I wasn't satisfied by the end of it. Decided to just drop this thing after reading guides on how to get them eidolons or even gold, because quests sure won't give you much(yes the market IS broken).So just don't play this if you want to play an MMO. Do it for the cute girls. I wouldn't recommend spending a cent of a jar of air for this and I'm pitiful for playing 5+ hours with it. Yeah...",0

18469,SMITE®,2017.0,"I have more than 2k hours of playing this game now with a high elo in some gamemodes like arena and assault. And how do I get rewarded for those achievements? I get paired with people who don't even have 50 hours of gameplay against a team of balanced players. You see, because I have a high elo, Hirez's algorithm thinks that if I get paired with people with low elo, my elo will balance it out to a regular match. So I go positive or almost in all my games, almost always top dmg, and still can't win because I get at LEAST a lvl 20 feeder every match... The worst part is that when you try to give tips to those people on how to get better, they get really defensive and toxic...

It has quite a bit of a store, but with it being free-to-play, and not too overbearing, it's fine. I don't mind developers trying to earn money to keep a game running.",1
2483,Neverwinter,2015.0,"While writting this review i've over 1000+ hours played, several characters with max lvl and finished all end game content.The good:- pretty good and enjoyable combat system (pretty much the reason i still play it)- decent graphics- option for free 2 play players to get almost everything from the real cash shop (though it's hard and time consuming)- decent events and promotions once in a while (includes pvp events)- hourly activity event system (this is one of the best things which can happen to MMO, it pretty much helps to reduce queue times and give some bonus rewards to the players)The Bad:- This game had few heavy curreny exploits which totaly ruined the econmy. Lot's of the exploited currency was not removed and impact this game to this day. Many exploiters were not banned and run in Best in Slot items without any penalty.- Real money means very little (unless you can spend several thousand of $ on a game). Basically if you would want to get full BIS gear you'd need like ~2k of real $.- Bugs take months to get fixed (if they even bother to fix them in the first place)- Lot's of Overpowered items which come from Lockboxes. (sadly this game is not living on cosmetics stuff like Dota 2)- Several end game instances is often nearly unplayable due to server lags.- Very poor Class Balance- Extremely poor PvP balance (for example, you can move your Best in slot enchant from your high lvl character to a totaly low lvl character and use it in pvp because it have no min. lvl required) - I think i dont have to explain how much impact it have. Even at max lvl pvp there's insane gear gap between players.- Refiling system - pretty much pay to win feature. It makes all your gear useless so you have to spend lot's of real $ to get nearly BIS or BIS gear or pray to get lucky with some extremely rare drops.- This game does very little to reduce the gap between old and new players. If this doesnt change in near future it will be the reason why this game dies.",0
3686,DCS World Steam Edition,2014.0,"Barring the AI, this is a brilliant flight sim. I see in all the negative reviews complaints about complex controls.. This is not Arma, where planes and helicopters model less than a quarter of the systems they have; this is a realistic combat flight sim. If you don't have a joystick you are not going to enjoy this sim. Note that even ""game"" mode is more realistic than Arma. To those who think this is just another free to play money grab.. Each module has about the same amount of time put into them as each complete Battlefield game.. (maybe not Combined Arms)Pros:- Extremely detailed systems modelling for the A-10C, P51 and Ka-50 (although controls can be frustrating without a TrackIR)- Very high detail graphics-wise- Free updates add to the sim as well as fix things (the engine is also updated sometimes for more functionality)- Very large range of vehicles and aircraft to fight againstCons:- Poor AI (without extensive scripting in the editor). They overuse afterburner and run out of fuel when they reach their target, MiG-31s enter dogfights rather than outrun their enemies, ground units can see through forests and buildings, helicopter gunships fly high when attacking and almost never hover etc.- Some aircraft have lower resolution textures that look ugly.- Virtually unplayable without a joystick, but that is once again expected.",1
5635,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,"Y'know I've always enjoyed bloons since the first game. While this doesn't exactly play like the previous instalments in the series, it's absolutely a welcome change to me. Basically, rather than a hoard of bloons that are set by the computer, You play against others, attacking with your own bloons while trying to defend. For anyone that's played Clash Royale, it's sooorta like that (Except this came first). I'll also bring up how in singleplayer bloons games, you have access to every tower you've unlocked. But in battles, the battle lasts an hour at most, so you can only use 3 of your unlocked towers, and one more random tower. This can bring up some interesting combinations, letting you experiment on which one works best.       Many of you may know that there's a mobile version for this game. While you probably can't take this version around with you, depending on what kind of computer you have, This versions framerate is much better than the mobile version. And due to the use of a mouse and higher definition graphics, you can place towers in more precise locations.       In the end I don't really have many problems with this game. It's a solid, multiplayer tower defense. However, certain functions are blocked by a paywall, so look out for that.",1

16143,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2012.0,"Aside from having aged a bit roughly and not entirely Steam Controller compatible plus a bit of a grind and the in game store purchase model of fragmenting content (which if you were lucky and aware of the fact the  previous developers twice allowed a Lifetime VIP account including monthly complementary in game store credit versus monthly subscription model)  it makes up for the current in game trend of purchasing content separately for the sake of progression.

2332,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,"TL:DR The new update annihilated the game, don't waste your time until the positive reviews start coming back.The long version is that the game had some minor balancing issues, it played less like a clicker game and more like a macro game until you got to higher zones, when finally your clicks mattered to how much damage you'd do. Additionally, Attack Speed was a little broken since (as far as I know from how far I got into the game, about zone 40-45) you could only get attack speed with Spirits, so you'd spend your spirits on Attack Speed and get Damage and Gold Gain from leveling your girls to level 200, 400 or 600.Taking this minor balancing issue into consideration, the devs decided to murk the entire game and put it into an unplayable state, your clicks matter more and you're able to use an ability to essencially get 100% crit chance (crits now do x10 damage instead of x2, HOWEVER the ability takes 30 minutes to refresh) but now leveling the girls gives barely any damage, and your click damage in the mid to late game is dependant on the damage of your girls (You gain a % of their damage towards your clicks). It now takes hours to defeat some of the earlier bosses that you'd previously be able to beat your first or second try after collecting a small amount of gold.The only positive thing I can say is that it's nice that the damage your girls deal to the enemy isn't 'chunky' anymore, and now the enemy health bar slides down. Legitimately the only positive thing I can say.",0

But these key elemnts of a battle royal in H1Z1 is so poorly executed that the game falls so short, of its own promisse. Some examples of♥♥♥♥♥up are the combat system and how the guns behave, the guns in H1Z1 doesn´t shoot like a normal gun no they shoot in a wide as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ark instead of straight path like a normal gun but no! and the blow back is so unrealistic for an example.

1580,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter playing a handful of games H&G starts off really interesting and really cool. The nastalgia of playing a WW2 game is the main driving force of this though, and once that wears off you start to see the uglier parts of the game.Overall I'd give this game a 6/10, although I can't really recommend it, either as a shooter game or a world war 2 experience.The game falls short in portraying the weapons and items accurately, instead choosing to make weapons stronger/better than others simply based on when you unlock them. I played a match where my gweher rifle got wrecked by a guy running around with a 1911 pistol. Why? Simply because it is hard to unlock the 1911 pistol and the gweher is the starting weapon.The game falls into some seriously bad free to play pitfalls. It is hard to progress without spending money and players that do spend money have some significant advantages over the free to play crowd. F2P players are locked out of a perk and progress much slower. Normally not a huge deal, but the later tier weaponry is so much better than the starting gear that you'll feel the punishment for sure. Especially when tanks and planes show up.Some other minor issues:The graphics are lacklusterThe spawning system is obnoxiousShooting is challengingF2P model hinders the overall experienceGuns are unbalanced (later game guns are uncontestedly better than earlier guns, no reason to use M1G over springfield).Some positives that I love about the game:The maps are really coolThe big scale battles feel epicShooting is challengingProgression system and unlocking careers for soldiersTanks, planes, all things WW2 (I love WW2).Overall if you are looking for a cool WW2 game this is a cool little game and will satisfy in all the right places. If you are looking for a shooter game to sink a ton of time into (that is based in the past) though, maybe try Red Orchestra or wait for Battlefield 1. ",0

However when you realize what you can do to help the mission and overtake the maps. It becomes incredibly rewarding to take enemy bases, especially in the epicly large firefights as your storm across the maps in 200+ man raid teams. As a free-to-play, I highly recomment it.",1

10175,Creativerse,2018.0,"Honestly it's overall a good game, here are pro's and con's from my perspective.First, the bad stuff.Con:1. I dont like that f2p'ers are a captive audience for advertising Pro on the loading screens. I feel pro would sell better if they advertised it less, but then they do need to keep the lights on, I get it. 2. Here's the bull in the china shop. Lag. This game is not well optimized and can bring a modern gaming wonder to its knees. Pets and lighting, two important things, cause a lot of lag. There could be many optimizations made.3. Glitches. There are many position-based glitches that are very annoying, closing a door on yourself can send you to the top of the skybox, guaranteed death if you have no pro, and hitting blocks just right can also send you up, in addition to placing blocks over your feet. Keepas are very annoying for their high-jump abilities thanks to this. All of these are annoying. Also many games have developed a loading glitch where the world stops rendering in front of the player, and if they arent careful, they fall allllllllll the way down and THEN the game loads but now they are in the corruption layer with no escape. Also, as Murphy's Law dictates, right in front of a Thing.4. Money. Hey, I get it, you need money, but some of the micro transactions are a bit much. I think especially on smaller packs of items or outfits or recipes and such, the block/item count needs to be raised for it to be balanced. (edit: it has been raised, so thanks, but I'm leaving this in because it wasn't raised by a ton)5. Lighting. Okay guys, heres the issue. Lights in this game are way underpowered, and the textures for them dont fit a lot of buildings, or if they do, they are super bulky. I would like to see more lamp and lantern textures.6. Automation. Okay, so ths is coming after having played the game for over a thousand hours, and besides lag, I would have to say, my biggest desire for this game is automation. As of writing this, you can't automate processing or forging. Early game, this poses no problem, but late game, when (like me) you have 300 some odd processors to handle the massive capacities your builds need, it can get pretty tedious to put everything in a processor. It would be nice to like have a processor you could wire to a chest and preset to chop slabs, slopes, or rods. Same with furnaces. I can take care of capacity, just please please please please please dont make me have to go through EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. of them to process a bunch of stuff. It would be so nice to be able to (late-game, again) pop a bunch of items into a chest and come back later, open the output chest, and have it all done neatly. I would freaking love you guys.Yeah I'll shut up now...Okay now for the fun stuff.Pro:1. Yeah the ads are annoying, but I do have to say, pro is worth the 20 bucks, so good job on that. 2. The one glitch I love: the terrible aero system. You guys have a grotequely innaccurate aerodynamic system for the glider, and it's amazing. It allows skilled flyers to gain altitude over time without using boost. Its pretty great, I'd honestly be really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if it got removed. It adds a TON of usefulness to the glider. Honestly, I'm rather surprised most people dont know how to utilize this.3. The tech. This game has more comprehensive in-depth logic gates and stuff than most minecraft style games, and once you get the hang of it its great. The arc signs are tons of fun. Just add more to it and please folks, for the love of God, please stop changing the arc sign sprites.4. Textures. This game is quite pretty, and besides the above issues, the prettiness is great. They're also fairly clever in marketing certain textures without it being forced. You can buy them, but you are totally fine without them.5. Rotation. I played some minecraft, and in just a few hours, I instantly missed my precious rotation from this game. Sure, its a bit wonky, but it's miles better than trying to stand in all the most awkward places possible just to make a build look how you want it to.6. Farming. Lots of people complain how there is no creative mode, but honestly, this game is far more generous in farming resources than Minecraft, the game everyone compares it to. It takes less farming to build more resources, so I like the fact that after you're done with the early game, it kinda settles down to a pleasant middle ground between survival and creative. I can get how it's not for some people, but for me, it's nice. Farming feels fairly rewarding, without feeling hollow like creative can, so when you have a hugely massive creation, you can feel proud that you farmed all those resources.7. Stack Size. Right alongside farming resources, the new and improved stack size of 999 is soooooo much nicer than 64.Not only can you make tons of stuff, you can now hoard it too! I should know, I hoard everything (even Pebble's Pebbles. I mean seriously, who uses them? But I hoard em anyway. Why not? I got the space!) so go nuts.Overall, this game basically covers what I originally wanted from minecraft, the ability to build huge stunning creations people appreciate. I enjoy it and hope you do too!",1

1192,Dota 2,2014.0,"Dota2 often claimed to be the hardest MOBA there is and that is because the game is very complex, which is why there is a ~10 hour tutorial trying to breakdown the game mechanics into little pieces and if you want to get faster and easier into it you can't avoid watching videos for more tips'n'tricks, which makes this game very time consuming, not to mention that an average game is between 30 and 50 minutes long.However when you dig yourself through the wall of Dota2 and got to the point, where you start understanding what you are doing wrong. Then the game gets very rewarding and fun. Playing Dota2 is a combination of strategy - which hero to pick, where to lane, what items to buy and satisfying combat, one hero usually has 4 abilities and one of them being there ultimate ability, which is the hero's strongest ability, for newbies, there are a lot of hero's with passives and few abilities.Something, which I don't usually mention in reviews, is the voice acting, this game, although it has 108 different characters, has really good voice acting for every single hero. Although the game is getting to get a bit older now, its graphics are definetly up to date and personally I really like the water, it looks really good.Overall if have a lot of spare time and for a very strategic in-depth game go for it!

Avoiding that at all costs, no matter how difficult it was to keep the game ""deep"", was perhaps _the_ genius masterstroke of Hearthstone, and it's completely baffling that Legends would try to turn back the clock on that.Normally this wouldn't be so much of a dealbreaker but Legends is _so_ similar to Hearthstone in design that it forces comparison, and must necessarily beat Hearthstone at its own game - which it doesn't.",0
335,Bloons TD Battles,2018.0,"Product received for freeThe game is fun when you have all the towers Max level and you have some money banked up, but the only way to even get there is dump countless dollars into this EA inspired pay-to-win nonsense of a game; or you can lose hundreds of games to guys with way more money, way more skill, and probably larger weiners. This game might be one of the worst i've seen in terms of design. and yes that includes the 2nd bloons td which was a nightmare. If you can get past that - which i cannot - then the game is bloons at its roots. Sad they had to ruin it with the cash-grab shenanigans. Also who made the powerups a thing. What is this halo?

5513,Dungeon Defenders II,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's still in early development but already quite playable. For the players familiar with DD1 it's a feast of recognition and for those new into the world of ""hybrid FPS combined with tower defenses"" there's a tutorial and campaign easing you into the game.At the moment of this writing there's only 4 characters available, the same foursome from the original. But in true spirit the characters have aged a bit and no longer look like grade-school Southpark aged characters but more like teenagers. Quite a nice detail giving you the feeling of story progression.The game is still defend a crystal (see it as a homebase) from getting damaged by angry enemies. You can do this actively by killing them with your hero (the FPS element) or using your heroes defenses, arrow shooting towers, explosive traps auras and walls/barriers.Not all is quite finished yet. The way xp evolves at the moment is still a bit unbalanced the same if you compare the ratio of hero damage versus the damage traps/towers do. At the moment there's lots of ways to share your feedback via the forum and the developers seems to take the feedback into account.It's not a finished gem yet, but from what I can tell it plays a lot better than plenty of other ""beta games"" available on steam now.So if you can live with a few issues and enjoy playing either solo (doable) or with friends (co-op) then this can be a fun game",1

17512,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAn excellent game that i would highly reccommend to anyone who wants a card game more complex than Hearthstone and less complex then MTG. It is very generous with giving out cards, including free decks every few days, and has a good draft mode that lets you keep the cards you draft, even if you lose.Only major gripe i can say, is that you will sometimes run into mana problems, due to your resources being entirely based on your luck of the draw. This can really frustrate games, where you run into extreme resource shortages or over-abundances. It is a fairly serious problem, as deck shuffling is entirely too RNG at times.If you do decide to play, the referral system, it provides free decks to starting players which is great.",1

1607,SMITE®,2015.0,"Let's start by saying that I have way more then 22 hours of this game played. its more like just shy of 700 hours and, that I ABSOLUTLY HATE traditional MOBA's such as League of Legends, and  Dota. But smite is not traditional. Smite offers a unique 3rd-person view with easy movment controls of the WASD rather then the tedious spam clicking. The perspective of the game allows many people to sit down and feel much more confortable and allows for a quicker grasp of the game, and also puts more on timing and skill into the game.The only complaint that I have on the game is that no matter what mode I play, I always get put on a team of monkeys who would be better teammates if they where smashing their faces into the keyboard.

84,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is probably the most dissapointing game I've played, the old game (its so different it could easily be a different game) had fun, challenging gameplay but now they've scrapped that idea and have made it the exact defenition of a pay to play. This includes overpowered weapons that 1 shot new players, impossibly large sums of money required to get anything at all, premiums get twice as many items from crates as non-premiums, playing in a match with a premium doesn't give you additional money like it used to, I could go on for hours.The largest problem I've encountered is players attaching a really OP weapon to their robot but nothing else and lowering their cpu enough to get into new players' matches, meaning that they'll always win and gain easy loot. This mainly occurs with the new AeroFlak Cannon which, in early games, destroys any ground targets, even though the weapon was designed to be an anti aircraft gun.Secondly the insane cost of items. So you play a match, come first in the team and win, gaining a protonium crate, and gain some stuff you dont want, so you sell it and gain maybe 300 money. Now you want to buy something...oh wait, you can't...because even the cheapest gun costs 400 and selling items gets you less than a tenth of what you can buy it for in some cases. So, you play another match...but there's someone with an AeroFlak, by the way did I mention that the AeroFlak costs 75,000 to buy?But thats not even the most expensive item there is, the lock on rocket launcher (another commonly used cheat weapon) costs 125,000 to buy, and I bet that leaves you wondering ""but how do I get that?"" well the sad answer is... you don't... or at least without spending MORE MONEY.Anyway you obviously loose and get a rusty case and inside you find... some more junk.This has basically described what the game feels like for non-premiums...but wait, what if you are a premium? Well other than costing a TON of money (a single day costs £1) it is very good, access to all the paints (yes thats only for premiums), twice the items from crates, custom profile pic ect. All of this has led this game to be very pay to play and it feels as if the developers just don't care enough anymore to change it, they've gotten too greedy with money to think, is this a good, fun game?1/10 huge dissapointment",0

914,Neverwinter,2016.0," Enjoyable in short bursts For a long time, I stopped playing NW because it was an unoptimized piece of grabo and Cryptic werenâ€™t all that interested in fixing it. Iâ€™ve returned after more than six months to NW and I gotta say itâ€™s a pretty fun f2p MMO, taken in small doses. The combat is fast paced and satisfying, plus after a longâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥time the game is finally optimized and you can properly enjoy it (it should run at 50-60fps on most PCâ€™s even in more crowded areas).Although itâ€™s based on the Forgotten Realms D&D setting, this game is nothing like its tabletop counterpart (or Neverwinter Nights for that matter). NW is an action MMO through and through, your characters have no alignment to speak of, so you can choose whatever class you fancy without a worry in the world (except for the fact that some races work better for some classes). The voice acting is decent, the music is pretty good, graphics are acceptable (better than most f2p MMOâ€™s on the market), just donâ€™t go into this game expecting the next big thing.If you are not willing to spend any money on this game, then I would suggest you stay away from PvP. As a non-paying player you wonâ€™t be on equal footing with those that decide to pay for some cash shop items that make your life much easier (or those who have played aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ton). As a side note, you are able to convert astral diamonds (a currency you get from different in-game activities) into Zen (the premium currency, that can also be bought with your hard earned $) to buy stuff from the cash shop, but the rates arenâ€™t all that great.Another problem for free players is that we are limited to 2 character slots per account, which is kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the only way to get more is with Zen (on the other hand, you can make and use as many free accounts as you like). Whatâ€™s more, 3 races are locked behind game packs that go for 49,99 â‚¬ for the Moon Elf, 69,99 â‚¬ for the Dragonborn and 189,99 â‚¬ for the Menzoberranzan Renegade (the packs also include some mounts, a char slot each and some otherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥thatâ€™s not all that useful).As for PvE, itâ€™s pretty entertaining, albeit repetitive. Once you hit max lvl, your main goals are to obtain some artifacts and do the campaigns (which mostly consist of doing daily quests, getting some resources which youâ€™ll use to research some passive skills for your character). The quests you do arenâ€™t all that memorable, but at least they arenâ€™t very long, so you wonâ€™t have to spend too much time with â€˜em. Recently theyâ€™ve also introduced a system that makes the campaigns faster for an alt but I havenâ€™t spent much time with it so I canâ€™t say how much faster they really are.All in all, if you can look past its flaws (which are quite a few), NW is a pleasant way to spend your spare time mindlessly killing monsters and grinding some gear.",1

No other software would be able to provide you more realism and get you closer to what a fighter pilot really feels aboard those powerful machines. The numerous controls are hard to handle at first and I recommend you to read the flight manuals to familiarize yourself with the numerous instruments available to you. The tutorials are too basic and don't allow you to put in practice what you've just learned as they are just a bunch of videos. So the flight manuals are really not a luxury you should pass.

Anyone that has been playing this game for at least 2 1/2 years will tell you all about how they hate Kabam for screwing up everything. This is true, however the game is not bad because of the mismanagement of Kabam. Kabam bought this game from Wild Shadow Studios, who were the original makers of the game, and started taking the game in a direction that the community was not too fond of. Before that, the game was very fun and spectacularly addicting... and it still is.

14585,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI've been playing CCGs longer than some of you have been alive; this is a pretty good one.  Essentially a slightly more technical version of Hearthstone (you can actually do a few things during the opponets turn) that uses the HEX resource system.  The F2P model is pretty generious IMO.  You'll certainly be able to progress, FOR FREE, long enough to know if you want to drop money on the game.  I made my first purchase after about 40hrs of totally free gameplay where I did several Drafts and Forge runs.  Pro tip, don't bother buying packs right away because again the game is very generious at getting you started, so wait until you've exhausted your Rank-Up rewards which give you +3 packs, for a total of +5 packs for beating a Gauntlet.  With 4 tiers that 20 packs of free cards; 15 cards a pack.  Plus there are other ways to get free packs, and Draft/Forge lets you keep the cards you picked, so yeah, its good stuff.",1

10710,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"First the bad:Netcode is generic and does cause framerate to stop on server lag. Mildly jarring.Premium service users get more dungeon runs per day, not just more xp. Pretty random. More on the issues with this later.Can sell 1 item a day, but at least you can sell items at all. (Maybe raise to 5, given premium users can sell 10 now.)Fee of 30% for selling is also pretty high, but not out of this world, especially since ToS doesn't seem to emphasize crafting like Blade and Soul did (which adequately gave people 10, premium people 20, sells per day. Given how important crafting was there. ToS might be fine with less.). It is quite random that premium users pay less than a third of the fee, though. Leaves a bad taste with me. Shared storage between characters added as a an afterthought to premium users. Either have it or don't have it, imo.The neutral:Like most recent MMOs, there's an emphasis on completing quests to progress, over the classic grind. Can't say that I like this (I prefer the model proposed by games such as Phantasy Star Online or Universe, making people go, as team or alone, through maps, without respawns. Kinda like if the dungeon system was designed to be the main thing people do in the game. Not the bland thing it is right now.), but it could be worse. Just means you will be re-playing the same story over and over and over with new characters. (On that note, please, PLEASE, make cutscenes skipable)The positive tradeoff is that you can progress pretty fast if you spend your attention on accepting and doing quests. (Outside of dungeons to grind when they come up, because good XP. Here's where I feel giving premium users more runs AND increased XP from killing monsters is just unreasonable.)The good:It's a fun gameFun GameplayEnough depth to keep you interested in experimenting with new classes and builds.Overall, I would recommend this game, because games are about gaming. Not about how much the people in charge have issues with making monetization not a pain. And it could be far worse, so still, give them some credit.",1

The stories are excellent if your a fan of Star Trek which I am, theres loads of reference to all the franchises with episodes of time travel to get your origianl series fill.The ship battles are my favourite. This isn't Dota you have a full array of abilities to chose from, my Naga gets a lot of use. I am really enjoying the Science vessel it is my kind of play style and feels like a character in itself. There are hundred of different ways you can play the ships. Having a science vessel but then having a tactical team or a mix of all. You even chose the different officers on your ship which then opens up different abilities which you can choose from.You get duty officers alos which you can send on mission and this can level you, get skill points and dilithium.I havent finished learning the game, there seems like there is much more and they are always improving it and adding new seasons.",1

7763,Neverwinter,2016.0,"Allow me to start this review by saying that the game in it's basic,free to play version is a decent one to say the least,with a pretty nice community and enjoyable gameplay.Why then am I not recommening this game?It is common knowledge that these types of games are leaning more and more towards P2W,but while other games might actually care about you if you spend money,not this one.Not if use your Steam Wallet to buy the products at any rate.I used my Steam Wallet to buy some currency called Zen,hoping to sell it in game for quick Astral Diamonds,which is basically the common currency.Not only was I not rewarded the First Time buyer's pack,which is reserved for people who buy directly from Arc,my account was put on Probation: meaning anything I buy is bound to my account and I am unable to sell Zen.You would think a day or two while they verify the payment would be understandable,but it has been a week and a half and I am still on probation.I thought fine,lets try something else,so I bought Enchanted Keys which let you open Lockboxes,hoping to find a decent item to sell in the Auction House.The keys were also bound but what they fail to mention is EVEN THE REWARDS IN THE LOCKBOXES WILL BE BOUND.So for example if you found a mount selling for around 6million Astral Diamonds which you do not like or already have you're stuck with it.I can almost hear people say ""Dum*a// of course the rewards will be bound,your key was also bound"" but you are wrong,VIP players (and yes I am one) get an Enchanted Key everyday which is also bound,however the rewards opened with it are not.So to recap,I do recommend this game in the Free to Play mode,possibly get VIP,but do not bother using more money to be treated like a third grade citizen.",0

13694,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWhile I do like this game, I can't really recommend it.I've played a lot of Magic: The Gathering years ago, and I hoped this game could scratch the itch M:TG left behind. And while it certainly does scratch it real good. There is one glaring issue: Mana decides way too many battles.Yes this happens in M:TG too, but not nearly as often as in Eternal. You see, Mana draw can go into 3 ways: You draw not enough Mana to play your cards, you draw as much as you needed or you draw too much that you have no other cards to play. And sadly in most of my Eternal matches I draw too much Mana.In Eternal your deck of 75 cards needs at least 1/3 consist of Mana cards, however I often find myself still drawing 4 or 5 Mana cards in a row while having the bare minimum required Mana in my deck. The game does provide cards to make this happen less, like monuments (Mana cards that change into different non-Mana cards when you have at least x amount of Mana) or waymarks (Mana cards that do something extra when you have a certain amount of Mana reached) and cards with the Scout ability (allowing you to see the top card of your deck and decide to keep it there or put it at the bottom).However these things are not enough. In M:TG you don’t have a minimum Mana requirement, plus you have cards that allow you to search your deck (usually for a card) and lets you (often) get to choose whether you want to shuffle your deck or not. Making the chance you draw more unnecessary Mana in your next few turns a lot smaller. Also in M:TG you have cards that allow you to draw the first Mana card in your deck, making the chance smaller that you will draw a Mana card in your next turn. I know Eternal has cards that allow you to draw Mana from your deck (like Seek Power), but none say anything about it being the top one. So I assume it just picks a random Mana card instead the one that lies the highest in your deck (which personally also feels like that).I probably still play this game, at least until Magic Arena releases. And if you really need to scratch that M:TG itch you can try this game without issue. But If you can wait, then I’d say wait till Magic Arena.",0
652,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAs of late this game has become cancerous, horrible, terrible, absolutely crap. Ill be talking about some major points.1: Weapons2: Types of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bots3: Rewards after each match4: The matching system5: Removed tech tree6: Pilot Seat Removed1: WeaponsThere are 3 major weapons I want to talk about. A: The worst one of them all, the Rocket Launcher B: Anti-air C: Shotguns.A: Rocket launchers are the worst, they are also the most expensive. To use them you lock onto a target and fire away, one volley should more or less kill anything, if not kill it, incapacitate it or heavily damage it unless target does evasive movements, which is just spamming all your movement buttons trying to get to cover. One rocket does 40700 damage, and you fire roughly 12 per volley. It can be placed on anything, tanks, mechs, crawlers and even helicopters, worst thing about them being on helis is that you cant get to cover because they just fly above you and they are hard to hit unless you have anti-air. Basically, these guns require no skill what so ever to use, they seem like a lot but in hind sight, they are very very easy to get, a few days of playing, maybe a week of saving up and you can get one.B: Anti-Air guns, Flak cannons. THey are absolute cancer when it comes to ANYTHING that flies or hovers. They detonate when they come close to a flying thing, you don't even have to be flying, just in the air, so this counts for Mechs who jump or Crawlers who jump too. They cost the LEAST and have the same explosive radius as the strongest Plasma Cannons, which is horse crap. They do 31710 damage each shot but cripple any fliers there are. Some people have both this and a rocket launcher on their ship making it the worst thing in existance to planes and helis.C: Shotguns. THese things arent too bad, they do jack all if you are any further than about 50 yards. They can only be shot 4 times before all your energy is drained and you gotta wait but normally if you get close enough, thats enough to kill anything. THey do the most damage with a shocking 225000 per hit, but that drops durastically as the range increases. They are strong too, with 110618 health, they can take quite a beating.2: Bots. There are several kinds of bots that are just horrible to fight against. A: Mechs B: Box Fliers C: Helis with rockets A: Mechs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. THey have the most health they already come with shields on their legs, they can jump and are relitively fast. The most common mech is one with shotguns or any other god/cancer gun supported by normally the strongest smgs or plasma cannons in the game. These bots are able to take on any other bot and win pretty much, they jump aroudn and get close to you before using their shotgun to wipe the floor with you, or they use their other cancer guns on you. You can kill them if you have a buddy or if you can manage to take out the mechs guns or legs. You can have LITTERALLY everything at the front in one place, gravity doesnt exist for them, it can be as high as the effiel ♥♥♥♥ing tower and have two piddly little legs and it wouldnt matter, it would walk fine, jump fine, fight fine. If you put Pilots Seats back, it would make Mechs a lot harder to build and use.B: Box fliers. These things are the absolute worst. They dont have wings or heli blades, just thrusters, the way that they are built means its hard to actually kill them or deal sufficiant damage in big doses unless you are right up close to them or you have a shotgun. They do require a sliver of skill to fly and handle but even then it doesnt matter, spend a couple match and you will be flying it well.C: Helis with Rockets. These things are the absolute worst, unless you ahve a rocket or anti-air on your team, you are screwed, this thing is able to fly just to the end of your render distance and fire rockets at you, its hard to get cover as they can just fly over it, normally supported by Plasma Cannons or sometimes SMGs, these things are horrible to deal with.3: Rewards. Ok so, the rewards are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, its chance. You could do the best in the team but get the worst rewards due to luck, you get items now which is annoying kind of, anyone can get anything, a new player could get a shotgun or a rocket lancher. But if you get it, yaaay. You dont get enough money from rewards though, normally. I prefered it when it was money you got from rewards, made it so much better.4: Matching system. They have always had issues with this, if you have a bot with 1000 Pflops, you get put in a game with people that have 1000 Pflops, but some people have no soul and are probably bullies irl or have some sort of issue as they go into those matchs with small ships with rediculously op guns and armour.5: Tech tree was removed, bad move, now anyone can buy the really strong guns if they save up enough. A new player could buy the second strongest Plasma Cannon with ease, same with the SMG. Then refere to the Matching System above6: Pilot Seat Removed: Naah mate, thats silly, having the pilot seat was good because it made people armour up around the seat the most, it made people actually think about how best to make the craft to protect the pilot AND give it the best fire power possible AND it gave people the ability to think about where to shoot the bot, where you thinking the seat is to kill them most efficiently, the only bad thing was you could get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t one shot.Some people are complaining about the fact that you can have 5 different types of guns on your ship, i agree in some ways but at the same time i think it was needed, sometimes a guy with only plasma cannons cant defend himself against a flier. If a Plasma Cannon user came up against an SMG user, he'd pretty much lose in most scenarios because he'd have his guns shot off, the SMGs could get shot off too but you normally run out of energy before you can do that, but if you have at least some smgs you can put up a slightly better fight. I think maybe reduce it to 3 and have cancer/god guns take up all three of thoseSummary: Anything that flies is NEXT TO ♥♥♥♥ING USELESS! Rockets need to be removed or nerfed a bunch, Flak need to cost more and have a reduced explosion size, shotguns, meh, their fine, Box fliers need to be stopped somehow as they are over powered. Mechs need a nerf too. If you use a cancer/god gun you should be put into matchs with other people who have the same god guns. The Matching system needs to be fixed and the reward system needs to be fixed aswell.",0
9961,Path of Exile,2018.0,"I want to love Path of Exile. I really do. The developers are amazing and they've created an action RPG that far surpasses the scope of Diablo 3. They keep pumping regular updates and the new season ladders keep content fresh. The story is...there...if you want to get into it, but you aren't going to play this game for the story. The gameplay is absolutely amazing. IF you have a good build.And that's where the game falls short for me. Building your character is brutal and unforgiving in Path of Exile. A couple of mistakes ensure that your build becomes low tier garbage and you have to either spend hours grinding for Regret orbs which let you reskill ONE point each, or you have to build a new character from scratch. Some people enjoy this kind of rigidity. I do not. I can't honestly enjoy playing the game when half my time is spent alt tabbed into the build maker and character build guides online, just so I don't mess my character and turn it into an unplayable dung heap.",0

9202,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"I'm the kind of player who's very patient with games. This game got me excited. An old school, classic MMORPG, with complex builds and multiple classes. The complex builds makes each and everyone in the same class unique in their own way depending on their build, such that everyone who is the same level might not necessarily have the same stats and Damage or Defense (Or Magic Attack or Magic Defense). You could be lv50 and dish out more damage than another person of the same class who is level 60, but lower defense. it's all in the build, and strategizing which path you take in the order of classes.  But after almost 100 hours of playing ToS, it got annoying.. the fact that it's just another developer who wants to profit from the game. Players who bought their VIP passes get almost all the benefits of what a F2P game should be. Whereas all the non cash players struggle a lot just to earn or grind decently.

They updated it, took away the tier system, and added a new ""points"" system. this was pretty easy to deal with, as you still could buy items from the in-game store. next, the multiple weapons update, this took away the specialized comabat roles of individual bots, not to metion auto-heal which turned robocraft into ""shoot as much as you can then get behind cover"" as opppose to ""plan with your team or die."" then came the worst update, the epic loot, you can no longer buy items from the store, you can only get them by paying for crates, or playing enough to get the items you need. this completly ruins the purpose of bot design as you cannot buy new items, you can only wait for that weapon the you were saving up for before the update. mabye someday Freejam will listen to thier playerbase, mabye someday they will become less hungry for our wallets, until then, may we remember robocraft.",0

The class system became imbalanced almost immediately with people rushing to pvp, and when they tried to adjust for pvp, they made pve different as well. The difficulty of the game when those changes happened significantly increased, and I know people wanted the game to be some what harder, but it just made it not enjoyable for me.

1174,Magic Duels,2017.0,"Product received for freeRecently I've been playing Magic Duels once again, thus ending my half-year hiatus of playing this game. ...So much is broken now. :(This game went from being my favourite source of Magic the Gathering, to being uninstalled and frowned upon in the span of 2 weeks. Here are some of the basic problems now featured within the game: - - - - Cons: Connecting to players is a huge hassle now. Half of the time the game will break off connection when queneing for an opponent, forcing you to exit to the main menu in order to requene again. This often leads to you having to restart your game, as once you've started connecting to a user you can't back out. You'll be sitting on a loading screen for the rest of eternity if the game doesn't detect your connection problems in time. Two Headed Giant is nigh impossible to play together with friends now. 50% of the time it'll put me on the opposite team when queneing with a friend now. This is extremely frustrating and annoying for quite obvious reasons.  Lag is now a very common occurrence. Lag spikes often result in the game playing the wrong card from your hand, or having your turn-time drastically reduced. Lag gets so bad that half of the games I've played my opponent has disconnected due to timing out, which results in the rest of the match being played against a clunky AI. Speaking of the AI, boy oh boy is the AI fishy. I'm 99% certain that the AI predetermines card draws in some situations, like it does in the multiple tutorials featured within the game. The amount of times you'll get mana-rushed/droughted in the game is absolutely ridiculous now. I guarantee you that you'll find yourself getting mana-screwed x10 more often in Magic Duels than you would when playing IRL. No matter which deck I play I can never go longer than 2 rounds without suffering mana problems. My other friends who play Magic Duels can confirm that this happens to them as well. It's almost like some sort of ""unlucky modifier"" got added into the game during the last patch. - - - -Final Verdict:Due to all these new technical issues, I can no longer support Magic Duels. The game has 0 entertainment value for me now, as it plays just as well as a broken toaster toasts bread. I've given this game 25H in the past 2 weeks to grow on me once again, but each hour I've played this game has made me like it less and less. It's a shame really, as this game used to be quite enjoyable.",0
9153,Path of Exile,2016.0,"I honestly wish I found this game sooner.Not only is this diablo-style game better than actual diablo, it has amazing mechanics I have never seen before in any game.The orb currency system is an amazing alternative to a gold system. Skill Gems are an amazing way to customize skills to make them perfect.My only problem with the game is that the microtransactions are not so micro. Almost 50$ for a pack of armor skins.

17182,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewHaG plays a lot like Red Orchestra II, except if the graphics were about 3 years older, and it had severe server and hitreg issues, and was ""Free to Play"", but approaching Pay to Win, and had terrible balance, and...Let's say you just started. You're given a semi-automatic rifle and a pile of grenades. Seems not bad. The problem comes when you realize that that rifle, being only semi-automatic in a game with such atrocious servers, struggles to hit, and also takes far too many shots to kill. You can, of course, buy an SMG early on, as the game ""helpfully"" directs you to. At that point, you are the god of CQC, at least until you're flanked by another fine gentleman with an SMG. But then, when you reach level 3, you're thrown into the big boys' servers. There, you get to play with enemy planes, tanks, paratroopers, and snipers. And of course the enemy side always has more of whichever is the most problematic for you. In my case, that turned out to be mainly tanks, with a side of pesky snipers. The tanks are hard to fight. As a foot soldier there is little you can do to start off.There is the occasional Panzerfaust (single shot) in a box which can be picked up. On some maps they're nonexistant, on others they're in locations vulnerable to enemy fire. Later on there is a reloadable rocket launcher to unlock, but I can't force myself to play long enough to get enough money for it. Most maps have a lot of open ground, which means tanks can spam from hundreds of meters away, and snipers can pick you off from similar distances.The game doesn't have a ping counter on the scoreboard, but I'm sure I'm getting at least 100, maybe 200 ms ping at all times. The deal is also sweetened by the fact that everything that matters is serverside. There have been many, many instances where you shoot a guy and even see the blood spatters, but the server doesn't count it as a hit.I can't reccomend that you play it at this point. Maybe it'll get better; it's a beta. But after seeing how far it's come in the past two years of beta (not far), I don't hold out much hope. ",0

15291,Star Trek Online,2015.0,"This game use to be really good, one of the best Sci-fi mmo's out there. But now, not so much.. From what I've gathered is the Delta Update broke pretty much everything that wasn't broken and made what already was much worse. PVP is dead. Ship balance is all ♥♥♥♥ed up end-game. Before Tier 5 was the best, they were expensive but it made sense for them to be. Tier 6 however, ♥♥♥♥ed it all up. From what I've gathered the pilot spec on a ship with a tank build is broken as all hell in PVP. The game is loosely Pay-to-Win, I say loosely because you go through a process to get zen coins which are needed to buy top tier items, but the process is painfully slow and on a single accout, you'll never see a profit. It takes up two two months across multiple accounts just to make enough Zen to buy a tier 6 ship. Constant lag spikes and random rubber-banding that shows no sign of being fixed anytime soon.Ground combat is awful, hands down one of the worst I've ever seen. Again, no sign's of that changing any time soon. Many of the planets are bland and boring with no point behind being able to go to them. Worst contender is Andoria, outside of what I think is melee PVP, there's nothing there. No Top tier melee shops, no nothing. No one ever goes there. Upgrading your gear seems to make game shops pointless, at least to me. Why waste 5,000 EC on a plasma array when you can make a better one for free?.Upgrading later on can be extremely slow. Only 3% of the game is voiced, which is fine if it wasn't.. All over the place? You could be having a scripted conversation with your First officer, they have a voice that covers the first three lines of the script then the rest of the paragraph has no voice over, it's just odd is all. All that is forgiveable if it wasn't for my last point, THE GAME IS BUSTED!!. For many users the game wont even load up anymore. It's always crashing, can't even get to log-in screen without it crashing, there are no long-term fixes. Re-starting the game only works a few times, after that not even Verifiying files or re-installing the game will fix it. In short, this game was once a great game, then delta came along and ruined it all. If I was in charge, delta would of been a update that revamps ground combat, squash bugs and glitches, offered up more Voice-over and improved PVP.",0
14143,World of Warships,2017.0,"I was a big fan of world of tanks before but things changed and made me hate the game...Now I decided to try this game...This game good..It is like Console Interface which I like.The game has very good graphics.

When I first tried it, I felt confused in a good way, and It was fun. 100's of People on foot, in Tanks, In Transport Trucks ""Called Sunderers"", And in fighters.                                                                                                                                         Then after 2-3 Months, I felt like I was repeating yesterday, over and over. The first impressions the game left on me vanished. I decided to stay, however, seeing I invested time, and money. But then a few months later, I noticed a decline in player activity, something I honestly expected.                                                                                                                          It dropped to mere a continent having fewer them 50 people on it. At that point I felt like people left because  of lack of content, lack of instructions, or lack of movitation. I then decided to quit my Membership, and leave the game all together.Now, onto the Pros, and the Cons.Pros:> A lot of weapons and tools to use.> A lot of so called ""Outfits"" that are player groups.> A good mix of Land, and Air vehicles to pilot.> Big battlegrounds to exchange fire.> Servers for different Time Zones.Cons:> Cosmetics and Membership are overpriced.> Weapons with in-game currency are overpriced.> Requires a High-Grade PC to run at decent settings.> Poor Tuturial level.> Poor In-Game Mic chat.> Possible unexpected game crashes.> Newer players can mess up a Base Capture-DefenseThats all I was able to think of.

Why gaijin needs 2 applications (3 if we count in steam) for a simple update, I have no idea, but agent running in background like a malware (since task manager is the only place where you can see it running) after closing it and deleting the game is fishy.

And balance issues  are understandable, I stuck with the game through those issues because hey, its hard to balance a createive game.But the most recent change where all of your income is basically a roll of the dice, no skill required, has done it for me. It's clearly set up so that you can buy ""boxes"" or cash to buy parts outright, but you can no longer simply rely on your skill level to ensure a good income level.

When I first spawned I had some bizarre glow around me and I can only assume it was a shield keeping me from being spawn-killed. I then turned my camera and had my first little giggle. Rotating the camera causes the character to spazz out and break its back. I did this for about a minute. Second thing I tried naturally was attacking a zombie, just to see how deadly they were. Melee with a flashlight does nothing btw. However, that is far less important than the clearly stolen code and animation from dayz mod for the zombies. If you played the MOD of dayz you know what im talking about. I really didn't last much longer after this. I entered a near by hanger? and saw what I can only describe as a truck from a play station 1 game, and that's a generous comment. But what really got me, was the fact that all of the guns had thick blue outlines so you could see them. Honestly I can't say just how embarrased these devs should feel about this ""game"".Last but certainly not least. When you die you have to wait 8minutes to respawn your character.

15262,Realm of the Mad God,2014.0,"This game has sooooooo much potential. It has the versatile feel of old-school console games, with the new concept of MMORPG interfacing with online friends and strangers. The system is simple, the game itself is fast paced, there are multiple opportunities to unlock achievements and a nearly bottomless system for weapons and armor.My ONLY complaint is that, outside of the initial two or three classes, the only way to unlock further classes, is to spend real money. While the game bills itself as a ""free to play"" experience, in order to get any real development out of the game content is to spend cash. The game also likes to drive that home by (1) making the bulk of the achievements revolve around things that you can only get through cash exchange, and (2) frequently dropping cool items that are only usable by the pay classes into the hands of mundane players.While I can recognize the validity and necessity of having games be ""pay to play"", I neither think it is fair of a company to present a ""pay to play"" game as anything but that, and I dislike games that stunt the growth and exploration of the player through monetary contingencies. As a compromise, the game could have an in-game mechanic that allows for the  gradual accrual of real money, much as is seen in Loadout.It is a shame the game is so impacted by the requirement of real cash, because that really prevents it from becoming a hugely popular game. But even so, I rate this a 7 out of 10. Check it out, but be ready to either break out your wallet, or get irritated that the game only lets you go so far.",1

11250,Neverwinter,2014.0,"This surprised me, for a f2p its not bad.    Pros: PvE this is where the game shines.  There's different  queues for dungeons and skirmishes (team up with people to defeat an outdoor mini dungeon) for your level range.  There's also the foundry which has thousands of player made content which is always being updated and keeps things fresh.  You can of course create a foundry mission which the community can play and applies to the previous statement.  Cons: The classes have balancing issues in pvp and if people have better gear than  you then you'll get rolled but if you farm enough you can get the same gear but its mildly pay to win.  There's class issues in PvE as well for instance I played a tank (so  called) which would lead you to believe you would tank, hold aggro, and be a damage sponge.  This is not the case.  You spend most of your time  running out of the red spots as a tank, which means you aren't dps'ing, which means you're not generating enough threat to hold aggro.  If you stand  in the red and don't block you take huge damage...as a fully geared tank, and spec'ed full tank (I tried both the tank trees in full defensive gear 51% dmg reduction, 32% parry which is very high, and 15% aoe reduction, a large hp pool, among other things) you take massive damage.Your only hope is to use your aoe taunt which has a long cooldown, and spam your fighters recovery daily which unless you're tactician you wont have up when you  need it so thats the  only viable spec I've found.  The so called cookie cutter spec is to stack attack power and go down the tree  that gives you double attack power if you have full block (which means if you block your dps is lowered based on how much shield you have remaining).  This is great for threat, but you can't take much damage and the healing in  this game is pretty bad imo.  This saddens me as I only had an interest in tanking in NW and they've failed the class.  Tanks aren't taken most of the time end game, people would rather have ranged and cc ( ranger and control wizard) control means no healing and more aoe damage potential.Until they fix the tank class to be able to actually tank I wont be playing the game.  ============================================================I did create a foundry mission which was very time consuming (you can spend as much or as little time as you wish on a foundry mission) as I chose to build my own multi-story building (very limited tools made this a lot harder than  it needed to be, for example, if you could select more than one object to copy / paste, it  would have saved me days of work if not more).The community can rate your foundry mission in a 5 star system if they play it and for the most part the community in the foundry is good.  But since most people don't create foundry missions, they don't appreciate how long it takes to make them.  If you want an example do a search for my foundry mission ""Ghost - behind enemy lines"" and play it.  That foundry took me over 3 weeks to make and I'm out of work so that means every day I was working on it (most of the time was building the last building).Its not all bad though, I went into the foundry  sort of knowing it would take a while and some people would be unappreciative but for the most  part the reviews were friendly and the comments some people had were very  satisfying and thoughtful.  People can donate astral diamonds to you if they wish and a lot of people do so that's nice.  If the community rates it high enough it can be hosted by the devs.   People play your content and enjoy it, that makes you feel like you wrote a novel (which you actually are an author in this case) and people like it, this makes it worth it.",1

6453,Star Trek Online,2018.0,"ITS AN OK GAME FOR FREE (had to make that bigger for some butthurt sto fans who can't accept its a buggy and pay2win game where they block you off at vice Admiral Ships lvl50 and you cant get ANY better ship unless you pay upwards of 15 to 40 dollars per ship so the game really hampers you once your Vice admiral) don't get me wrong but heres allll the reasons why they all need to be kicked in the balls except for their art team.1). 9/10 times when you try to go into the Interior of your ship the game will crash and throw you back to the login page were you will have to relog back in to then (hopefully) load inside your ship.2). 7/10 times the quests will not work properly the first time around, ie. not loading a certian area, not unlocking a door, simply the questline stops and refuses to advance, they poorly explain what they want you to do, some areas require you to do things the game never taught you to use let alone even tell you what abilitys and coomans you can give people, you'll have to figure that out yourself i suppose.3). The story is lacking (to me its boring and you can kinda see whats gonna happen next without much foresight.) 4). Poorly optomized idk how many times in cut scenes my guy will just stand up in his chair as my♥♥♥♥♥♥starts giving commands to my crew members as from my stomach up is out of the frame. If you actually read through the main stories you will see grammar mistakes and spelling errors which will make you cringe not because im a grammar nazi or anything i can't spell that great either but then again spell check is free and im not making a game and also asking for your money.5). The balls they have to have a sub service for this glitchy and bug infested mess of a free game. Maybe fix your game so its not a horrible buggy mess and maybe more people would wanna sub? Speaking of Bugs and glitches, if you thought Bethesda games had alot of bugs at launch try playing this game were its been out for 8 years and yet everytime you get on you think, ""How is this out of Early Acess?"" The amount of times you will run into Invisible walls in the middle of a wide open street, get stuff in a corner , or just get stuck on things in space. One time i ran into a Systems Sun and i wasn't able to get out of the suns area unless i restarted the gameNo creativity with the missions, most of the missions are Patrol missions but with harder enemies, after playing 3 different factions with 6 characters and all of them play into the same questline but with slightly different ways of going about it depending on if yer Klingon or Federation. Even when you hit lvl 60 and get to play as the Dominion, they have 1 unique chapter, and depending on what side you choose, your just do the beginning missions for each factions but just adjusted to your  level. For a free game its meh, game does a very poor job explaining what you can do in the game, it does a poor job getting you into the game (If you play as the 23rd century federation you meet Daniels while investigating  some weird thigns happening to star base. He introduces you to the Temporal Agents BS whatever and then when you hit lvl 30 ON THAT SAME CHARACTER you go to Danielsagain for a time mission AND HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO YOU LIKE YOU BOTH NEVER MET AND REINVITES YOU INTO THE TEMPORAL AGENTS THAT YOUR ALREADY IN) Seriously whoever did the storyboard, storyline, and story telling in this game should be shot over and over again. They put little to no effort into making sure the game runs smoothly and instead went for loot boxes, spending money on amazingly better then whatever you can possibly have ships, and over charged prices to unlock species. But again, its free so for a free game its slightly above a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥and more of a small heap of♥♥♥♥♥♥with star trek flag next to it.Oh and I hope you like small puzle mini games that once again they explain poorly and you'll have to figure out by googling them rather then waste  time on an already half made game.Ive put alot of hours into this game reading the story playing most if not all the missions  i could, and ive had this game since it came out and you had to pay a sub fee for this hot garbage, NOw thats its free and pay2win alot of broke ♥♥♥♥♥es who only have a few hours think its a bee knees, and ya if you only play up to lvl 30 and 40 its great but once you hit 50 you get the full shaft of these developers saying. ""Pay me money if you want nice things.""Im glad the only thing they undated and improved over the 8 years since it launched was to ♥♥♥♥ over people with lootboxes and dangling any ship above Vice Admiral you have to either pay for , or buy a key for a lootbox which you may or may not get a ship.",0

15046,Paladins®,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst of all, don't care about what ""PrivilegeWatch"" fans/youtubers say about this game, you are going to miss out a good game if you listen to them!Actually, I started this game when Overwatch had that free weekend!I don't know why i decided to download Paladins instead of Overwatch (maybe because of its big hype which reaches the disgusting level for me) but it was a good idea!Paladins is a good multiplayer, class based, FPS game with fantasy elements! Characters are more loveable and friendlier than in Overwatch, i hope we get more lore and backstory about them! Especially for Fernando and Mal'Damba!The card system is one of the most interesting thing in this game for me. You can make playstyles for yourself! Don't like that ability which has long cooldown? Just get that card which lowers it!Do you want add an additional attribute to your weapon? Pick up a card which adds that! It's awesome! Of course it's balanced, so spend those loadout points and choose those cards wisely!Unfortunately it's in the beta, has so many bugs and has less maps but I think they will add more stuff later. Another con is that there are script kiddies already which is very bad but even that cheating program, they can't really win, only with a decent/good team!That's all for now! Thanks for reading my review and I hope you give a chance to it too! Maybe, I will add more stuff to my review as time goes.Edit (2016.12.28): The Hi-Rez Studio support team is awesome! They totally earned my respect from me. If you get any serious problems (I had one where I didn't get crystals which I paid for), just go to the support and they will help you!Edit (2017. 11.23) Updated because of the free xp but let me add something:- It's still a very good team-based multiplayer game but the updates add a lot of bugs which may be fixed in a week of if we are luck in the next day. I don't recommend to play competitive on patch day or on the next day after patch day.-Talking about competitive, the current ranked is way better now. The only thing that I don't like in it it's the decay which happens when you don't play comp for 2 weeks.Have a nice day!",1

You can get around not paying a penny so long as you do the Missions but, this method will be very time consuming.  I'm happy to support the devs on this game.  They have provided an enjoyable game and deserve to be paid.  It's a hard game and you can walk around without seeing a thing.  Animals will scatter before you even get a glimps of them, they smell you coming from a mile away and tracking an animal for hours on end may sound tedious.

Wow, that's an overstatement if I ever seen one...Magic Duels is another incarnation of Magic the Gathering in digital form. If you don't know what MtG is, it's an insanely popular and deep fantasy card game. In comparison the digital version is extremely lacking. The campaign is ok-ish, you have some preset decks and fight several preset scenarios. Apart from that you have access to playing vs AI or vs human opponents. All would be well if not the fact that deckbuilding is heavily limited. First thing, same as in the physical version you have different sets available in the game, but only limited number of cards from these sets are available in the game. Second thing, you have to grind your♥♥♥♥♥off to get the cards. Or buy them using real money in the store. Yes, you get some basica cards after finishing each campaign, but to be able to build some competitive decks you have to slog through many battles with just basic commons. I love MtG, I played on national level many many years ago, but Magic Duels is so limiting it's not really fun.I liked:* it's MtGI disliked:* long and boring grind before you are able to build competitive decksGet this if:* you have to have everything MtG in digital formDon't get this if:* you expect actual MtG in digital form (go for Magic Online then)* you're ok with slow and boring grind before you can build your own decksSurprisingly the even more limiting previous versions, called then MtG: Duels of the Planeswalkers, were more fun than this one.",0

11203,Shadowverse CCG,2016.0,"My 5th Free to play card game (Epic Card battle>HS>Duelyst>Faeria>Shadowverse)First things first is this P2W? Slightly but due to devs giving you 40+ Booster packs at start it cancels it out since you have infinite chances to reroll what you get, you can start with a deck you are satisfied with. This would mean you dont start with just basic cards at the start and you can actually get meta decks with the original cards you get. If you want other stronger decks you will have to Grind it out or be lucky. Legendary drop rates are a bit low which is why I still think its ""Slightly P2W"" for other decks you dont have good cards with.Case in point. My Haven deck was nearly complete and was technically only missing on 2 Legendaries that I can somewhat replace with Gold cards. Not as efficient as the actual tier deck but I'll take it as a F2P deck.The game is like Hearthstone but the added ""mechanic"" of Evolution is nice but the thing that made me like this more is the fact that RNG is minimal there has only been 1 time where i really lost a game due to RNG due to a card.

17023,World of Warships,,"developers and supporting staffs of this game are ABUSIVE and TRASH.First, according to WG's policy (1.04, https://forum.worldofwarships.eu/announcement/17-world-of-warships-game-rules/) ""Wargaming.net may suspend, terminate, modify, or delete accounts at any time for ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, with or without notice to the owner of the account."" How do you feel?Unlike many other games, maybe WG staffs enjoy too much time in their Russian legal system, they DO actively use these ""rights"". And I am one of the victims to their arbitrariness. According to their exceptionally high language moral standard, WG considers saying two sentences twice per battle (and each battle ranges from 10 min to 20 min) as spamming, not abusive or advertising or political or religious or whatever reason you might suspect, but effing S P A M M I N G. And WG used this ""reason"" to chat ban me.OK, chat banned, no problem. So I contacted the supporting staff to remove the ban. Do they have the authority or ability to remove the ban? Sure, I have seen some other players' chat ban been relieved after contacting supporting guys. But this time, the supporting guy (A*** M*****) said they were incapable to remove chat bans.So that guy obviously lied about what they can do, and I pointed it out. You guess what happened? WG simply said, WG wouldn't talk about whether he lied or not, but two sentences twice per battle is SPAMMING and that deserves a chat ban. And by the way, I was suspended from the game 3 days for unsportsmanship even tho I did not violate any WG's rules (https://worldofwarships.com/en/news/gamestuff/anti-abuse-system/) about unsporting conducts.OHHH nice, pointing out they are lying and they get me game banned.

Tbh I wasnt that much invested into card games, but after playing Gwent in Witcher 3, i discovered they can be quite entertaining.This game though, is very much unlike Gwent (at least the old online version, because the new one had lost much of its originality) and revolves entirely around the ES universe and lore, with a very nice and immersive mechanic. The cards are rather cool, and I do enjoy the graphic style and overall design. The premium cards, not so much, someone got lazy there, because they have just some background effects instead of a full-blown animation (like the Gwent ones).I can see that a lot of people have complained about the new interface and connection/lag issues, but so far (after like 15-20 days) I have yet to encounter any such issue. All in all, its a solid card game, and especially after they included the 3-attribute sets, with  great replayability, if u care more for the story/stories than technical perfection.

16221,Star Trek Online,2015.0,"this is a fun to play, well made game that will be fuf for trekies and regular gamers alike. the missions are fun and well made, there is a decent variety of gear, ships and skills available, however, many of them are premium ships. putting money into the game is NOT necessary, and even the premium ships are possible to aquire in game thanks to a player run exchange for trading in game resources for premium currency, however... it will take weeks of grinding to get enough to buy them. as awful as this sounds, there is just enough variety and the combat is just satisfying enough that even what should be a grind is rather enjoyable if you let yourself get into it. it is not quite pay to win, rather pay to get ahead. the combat is somewhat unrealistic, the physics and controls feel quite arcade like... but it's still plenty of fun. there are ships for all different playstyles, everything from hard hitting, fast and stealthy but fragile warbirds to powerful all around battle cruisers. personally, i play a battle carrier as my main ship, and find it quite enjoyable. there is several ways to set up your ship and crew to be competitive, eveything from beam weapon focused ships capable of engaging targets at wide angles to fully torpedo focused warships capable of decimating unshielded enemies with massive volleys of torpedos, and whose main method of bringing down shields is using shield drain abilities.pros:-fun space combat-plenty of content-enough lore to satisfy trekies-multiplayer co-op is fun and beginner friendly-clan system is relitively well designed-multiple competitive playstyles, even in indiviual ship classes-even ""premium"" ships may be bought with in game currency with enough patience-although perhaps a bit too grindy, the grinding is actually enjoyable-most premium items in game that are NOT aquirable without spending real money do not give any real advantage in combat, someone with enough time on their hands can get to the level of a wallet warrior without paying a centcons:-ground combat feels like an afterthought, not very well designed, although still playable-the very best ships and the very rarest items in game require either a lot of time to grind out or you to open your wallet-controls can be a little confusing at first-pvp is rather limited, although this may not be an issue with some players such as myself",1
5501,War Thunder,2018.0,"Great game with good mechanics, loads of vehicles, great graphics and sound.The problem is that the developers think games should be work, not fun.

3789,Dungeon Defenders II,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewPlayed the first Dungeon Defenders game and this one it just a dissapointment compared to the first one. The gameplay feels clunky and gets boring fast, everything is in your face and just doesn't feel right once you've played the previous one. Playing with another friend this game got boring after finishing 2 maps so just shows how dull they've made this game. Not only that, they add ridiculous amount of DLC, and the price of each DLC is stupid, I don't think people are wanting to pay another £20-30 per DLC, people would much rather buy the game and then that is it and not pay anymore.",0

11223,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"This game will make you quit and delete it in a few games as you play. The blance of this game is just no where to be seen, and the grind is just one of the main problem, it makes you think the boosters will help but it wont do to much, And before the grind got screwed up their used to be a opiton to just buy the weapons or vechiles without talking a long time. Even other games such as world of Tanks or War Thunder could let you get it right off the bat. This game surely needs a reboot because this game anit going far, its only makes other WWII games much better than this, sure it dose have good maps and nice graphics but it dosent cover the rage and pain to deal throught a game. My word for it never get it untill theirs 3 good reviews in a row on it.      And if not just dont get it will save your lifetime. And for the people who have this game heres a note. Never give a single penny to this game it wont do you much now. And also if you do play it go for German its the only team that can win with its rediculos unbalnce team. (Updated) To add this on since its been a while I will admit this, they got the idea and the feel of what's it's like in the war, the guns and weapons are well detailed and the hard work of the people who did this much on the visual of the game is great. But since I haven't played it in a while my bets it's not much changed maybe half grind but the balance of the game is still a mystery. Overall give it a shot at least if you want but don't give a penny to them, because if we stop giving them the cash maybe they will finally fix some of the major problems in this game. But anywho take care you guys and fight on in the war! (updated 11/11/16) Since its veterans day i thought playing this game would do it, but it really didnt. For whats new going on about this just gettign worse and this whole game might abandon ship.       They got ride of bikes and the old trucks from the spawn point witch really is sad because thats the simple way to go to one place or another and not have to be forced to buy a truck. repairs in this game is just more sad because paying that much your lossing about 21,000 coins in that game for just that one weapon. still no since of balence of guns or ranks, grind is still not great, and the game balence of when their 3 enemy planes and your team has none. Idk who did there reserch but surely they didnt had much logic of having something little balence in the game. Buying gold is just pathic, just have it at simple numbers like 4.99 or 9.99 its that easy.      Maybe they need to get a buck more to survie but surely this game is still have no single thing of redemtion in it. For just something simple, have the game or balence of ranks, teams and guns, dont charged alot of paying or repairing weapons, and at least have some respect of whats the purpose of the game. This game has places where battle  acutally happen, and all over 70million lives lost in the war total, weaither its axis, allies or even citizens you really need to know whats it just like being in their shoes. So this game works but still not even, if you want to try it go ahead, but dont donate to them, if there going to screw you over in the future. A suggestion of another game would be Post Scriptum as it has no pay to win, alot more balanced, and a bit more content in my opinion, as its still early game but its more playable than H&G.",0

714,Eternal Card Game,,"you like games like Magic the Gathering and Hex, and are happy with their format and close resemblance to their gameplay, this is your game. For there are no suprises here and no real innovation. So if you want to play with new cards, go for it.But first...1)First you have to get through long and boring tutorial.2) Then through Long and boring AI deck gauntlet. At lowest level, they only play 1-2 relevant spells per game.Finally you can play some other formats, including ranked and ""draft"".About ""draft"" - instead of drafting against human opponents, you are drafting vs AI (but you play vs humans), what really kills that format. Yeah sure, it saves waiting time, but it makes the format pointless.Even I managed to go 7-1 in my first ""draft"", I was upgraded to silver rank (and then gold) soon and then it became really hard.By that time, I still found that the game was kind of fun, and decided to buy the founder pack, to get the campaign cards quickly. 5 days later I completely regret the desision. This game is not for me. I do not like magic anymore, I played Magic the Gathering (father of that type of card games) for 15 years and I have been off Magic for another 10. With all the possibilities, why dont you have creativity to improve on the format, not just offering the same game.And yeah, I dont like merhcant cards in constructed (units that access your ""sideboard"" during the game). I dont like the mana screws.  I dont like the sites mechanic (pwoerful castle that casts free spell each turn, ending with powerful champion). Nothing about this game's gameplay is, that I can really recommend. And UI. It is really hard to figure out how to use UI for some of the more complicated targeting spells.

Now its just pay to win and has lost the core consept of the game where you would place the best tier cubes you could get under your piolet seat and guns and use half cubes to channel where damage would go keeping it away from your pilot seat but now it is just how many guns can you put on that you bought with real moneya good game wasted.",0

7922,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015.0,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a tactical competitive first person shooter.  Aspect Review   Gameplay The competitive game mode is the main grasp of the game for me. It features close to endless enjoyment and always offers a different experience each time. The game is heavily skill based, and will require some time and effort to get better. There is plenty of guns, all with different recoil patterns. There are many maps in the game, and new ones are added during operations. There are also community maps you can play with friends as well. The other gamemodes to competitive are more casual gamemodes, but are usually not as enjoyable, due to the lack of skill groups meaning you will end up against better or worse opponents to yourself.   Graphics and Optimisation Graphics are not the main aim of CS:GO. They are nothing special, but are definately improved over previous games. The game is decently optimised, and can run on many machines, even old ones!   Additional Content The game has microtransactions in the form of weapon skins. They offer no in-game advantage and simply change the appearance of the weapon. They can be bought in the form of cases and keys, bought off the market individually or earned by playing the game as drops. You can sell the weapons and cases you earn from playing the game on the market, equip them for yourself or trade with other players.   Value This game is probably my most played game on Steam. I bought the game on sale for £2.50, but to be honest it's worth the full £12. If you do end up getting it on sale, you could probably earn the money back from weapon skins, or even profit. Of course, this is even possible when buying the game for the full price, but less likely.   Aspect Score (/10)   Gameplay 10   Graphics & Optimisation 6   Additional Content 10   Value 10   Pay to win? No   OVERALL 10 Notes: I rate this game to be the best FPS game I have ever played!!!

I'll give a positive review, because it's a great game, but there's one problem...The jump button barely works if you're using an XBox controller. I loved DD1, and played it with a controller, and loved it. Now, when I'm in the middle of a battle, trying to do what needs to be done, I can't even get around my towers because the jump button is so bugged out! I even end up dying sometimes because I fall in a pit, because the jump button doesn't register.I think the problem might be because the ""A"" button does other things, so I've tried to remap the jump button to something else... But the remapping aspect of the controller menu doesn't work!The game is absolutely amazing, and IF they fix this problem, I will totally love it, and probably play it just as much as I did DD1 (250 hours).

1955,Path of Exile,2016.0,"I was surprised that I did not have a review written for PoE, I have 2300+ hours played on the game. Let me preface this review by stating that if you know anything about the ARPG genre then you are probably already playing this game, but if you don't this review is for you. With all my experience I hope I can help you make the decision if this is the right game for you. So without further delay lets jump right in.The pros:- This game has a lot of content, more than most free to play games I have played. The developers actively and in a timely manner release new content, items and game mechanics on a 2~3 month cycle. They diligently pay attention to the continued existance of their game, I respect them for that.- The game is hard, especially for a new player. Don' listen to people who write in their reviews that the game has lost all challenge, these are usually people with thousands of hours played using the most expensive builds in the game to trivialize content like those builds are meant to. In this experience you can really fine tune how challenging the game is if you are after that.- The game has a very deep level of customization for builds, you can pick it up and play it no matter what you build, but don't expect your first build to carry you far. This game is most of all a learning experience, knowledge here really is power.- The visual design and music score are great, they really work to bring the world to life. There is plenty of lore hidden in item descriptions and places around the world. You can also build your own hideout from different items that the master NPCs in the game offer if you are into that like me.- This game is truly free, no content is held behind a pay wall. Crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥I know, but don't expect it to be given to you on a silver platter. However, no matter what you do every moment you sink into the game is worthwhile, everything you pick up no matter how incrementally leads to you reaching your goals. That is something that I can not say for most the experiences on the market.The cons:- The game is hard and unforgiving. You will die to random things while playing and have to piece back together what you did wrong if you don't want to die again. Do not get discouraged, it happens to literally everyone.- Trading is an essential skill you need to learn to get ahead in the game, but the trading community is very toxic. People trying to make a profit constantly prey on new players so learn how to use poe.trade and check it to make purchases and sales. Know what something is worth before you sell or buy.- The learning curve is steep, but there are plenty of resources to prepare you for it. You tube guides, the game forums and the amazing wiki have everything you could ever need to get started. Do not ask people in game to explain a nebulous concept to you, most of the game mechanics require several paragraphs to explain, use those other resources and feel free to ask specific questions about what you want to know.- The gap between the rich players and the poor players is truly vast, bridging it is impossible without a lot of effort. You can't pay to win and if you do to one of the illegal bots expect to get banned, the developers stay on top of that.In my opinion this is the best ARPG on the market and it keeps evolving to stay that way.

Roll in with a tank, carpet bomb with a gunship, or just charge in waving your gun around. -Massive scale, as chaotic as it is awe inspiring-High-octane fast paced combat-Your starter weapons are very viable, and wont need replacing any time soon.-Even after 6 years, the community is strong and the devs are very active. -Teamwork is rewarded and easily accessible, but solo play is just as viable-Kills are satisfying as hellThe Bad:-There are countless ways to die, and you will sample them all like fine wine.-Your enemies will be grizzled vets with hundreds, if not thousands of hours played-The learning curve has a well defined face dent from players smashing into it. -The grind is notable, but not unreasonable for a free to play game.-Performance can be rough, but with an upgrade to DirectX 11 inbound, this should improve fairly quickly.The Ugly:-NC Maxes",1

You have zero involvment in fighting, the only thing you do in the game, and quests revolve around literally waiting a few minutes watching a bar go up, not a loading bar, but a bar that tells you how long until you get to watch your character fight a vastly inferiour enemy.

332,VEGA Conflict,2017.0,"This game is for people who have money. With that said...Me personally,  I don't mind shelling out some cash for this game as I love it, and have been playing it for years making me a veteren player. But the reviews are true. As a newbie into this game, you have no chance. Without getting with an alliance within days of starting to build you will get ripped to shreads as this game is so unbalanced and built for people to feed it with real cash. I have seen this game make people so angry that it litterally gets into peoples heads and makes them shell out $100's of dollars. Brilliant Programming in my opinion. I have seen countless people dump $1000's into this game...and I am not even exaggerating. One guy dumped close to $8000 to build one advanced fleet. I am getting close to a grand myself after two years. To be the best, you need to build...build..craft..craft...pay or wait..pay or wait..and fight. If you can handle that and you have some money to BURN this game is really fun. Know if you do spend real money, you will spend it quicker than you can dump it into a slot machine to repair ships, build fleets, grind events. Spending real money is a one click adventure in which you buy coins for a certain amount and spend them by one clicking on specific things to accomplish in the game...or you can wait the countless hours for the same activity to take place for Free. But what fun is that.  I've been doing this for 2+ years now. Love the game, but I knew what I was getting into. I don't know how long the game will last as there aren't to many like me who would dump so much into the game. I won't bash the game, because it is what it is...but if i was a newcomer...trust me i know where you are coming from. Maybe I will see you out there....or maybe this review steered you away. Either way, be smart with your money and spend it on what you like doing.",1
7469,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"I tried to like Shadowverse, and it's still better than Hearthstone, but it's not great.Pros:-Nice Campaign mode-A few start-up packs-Animated character portraits-Everything's voiced-Evolve Mechanic to help recover from slow starts-More than 5 cards a pack-Potentially strong currency generation-Daily login bonus-Excellent motivation if you ever wish to commit suicide.Cons:-One Daily Mission slot is consumed by ""Link to another device"" by default. Steam version cannot link to another device, so players are denied a Daily slot.-Daily missions use the Hearthstone mandate of ""Win,"" making for a frustrating string of losses for classes people don't want to play. Only one mission may be rerolled a day.-BRUTAL demand for good cards and Hearthstone-esque crafting restrictions. People will restart entire accounts just to stand a chance with their initial draws.-No Matchmaking on Unranked.-Ranked becomes an invincible wall of meta decks as early as Beginner 2, making progression and income slow to achieve.-Strange emphasis and overvaluation of ""Take Two"", the Arena mode, which is five matches guaranteed, despite the appearance of being kicked out with no reward after one loss.-Immense RNG power.

19793,Aura Kingdom,2017.0,"Always Always always been into the art style AND  the Game play itself isn't so bad. but if anyone can say much in its more faulty side, they need to cool it on the in game market, plus the inability to spend points you bought with irl cash. say, they wont let you spend points you bought a year ago, but its like, if you buy in game premium currency, wait around two weeks to spend it and the game will tell you its an item mall item code error 99/ which is an in game error preventing you to spend in game currency. clear this up. and the Damage glitch in PvP, clear that as those who know are spreading this glitch to everyone else and its causing widespread unfair competitive game play within the AK gaming community. also, make gold easier to obtain, over the years of playing this game ive seen the Dev's become more and more greedy, employing Tawdry and sleazy tactics to practically force players to buy hold, pay for the premium currency, or purchase gold from shady third party providers Via PayPal. it isn't right. other than these issues the game hits the spot with many a way. thank you for reading this post and i hope it provides assistance towards making AK a better place for people to come and game as they please.",1

One drawback though is the frame-rate issues the original Arms Deal update introduced with all the gun skins, which many are experiencing and Valve don't really seem to be looking to fix any time soon. 2018 edit: Over time I have found the performance less of an issue with each upgrade of my hardware, but it appears Valve never bothered specifically addressed this themselves as they focused on fleshing out the microtransaction market instead.",1

9412,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2016.0,"Overall I love this game and would recommend it to anyone. What I like about this game is that there are a lot of things to do from customizing your character, weapons, clothing, housing all of it. There are lots of quest too some some of which are repeatable. You even get to pick a trade like woodworking or being a scholar just to name a few. You can join a kinship or start one of your own and help eachother out. You also get to interact with the original characters from Middle Earth like Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Frodo, and so many others. The one thing I think is a drawback is that you have to spend money to unlock most reigons in order to be able to do quest in them and there are some other items such as mounts and clothing that you need to buy with money as well. And there is a gold cap so you have to pay to expand that as well. So unless you have a job, or some deep pockets you can dig into and if you're not a giant passionionate fan for Lord of the Rings then this game is mostlikey not for you. But if the above is not an issue for you then I would totally say this is a great game for you. :)",1

19967,Digimon Masters Online,2016.0,"As much as I adore digimon I can't force myself enough to play this, OR CAN I ? PROS:- Great digimon models- Great attack animations- Solid sound- I even like (barely)  the elevator music in this game which suits the digimon universeCONS- Worst character ""customizaion"" I've ever seen in entire MMORPG gaming world.- Cash Grabing shop model - Only rental items and insane boosters. Also there are just few things you can buy in cash shop in terms of character customization.- There are roads and there are sidewalks, you can walk on the roads but forget about sidewalks.. - Very bad and boring map design- slow movement- Grindfest galore (it's kinda expected from F2P games)- Boring quests- Even though I love cell shaded graphics, Digimon models are the only thing that looks solid. The rest is a potato. very   bad ""feel"" overall- The worst UI I've seen in a MMORPG game. Completely unintuitive and plain ugly. Been playing games for over 20 years and this was the first time I was lost as a naked man sailing on a crooked carrot and trying to figure out what am I supposed to click next.- UI has the worst colour palette I've ever seen in a game. Everything is in ugly neon or over-saturated colours. From Lime green to dark magenta. Yes, It's so disturbing you can't even focus on the main game. Feels like a cheap flash game UI.- Overall feeling is that game looks and feels like it's from 2002 overall score :   bruised agumon/10EDIT: Bottom line, I'm still playing it. Looks like I can chew down pretty much any Digimon game no matter how bad it is. If you're a Digimon fan, there is no reason why you shouldn't try it. Although most of the maps look like a potato, some are really decent with nice cartoonish textures. Fighting model is what's keeping me playing for me it's really good and impactfull. (gotta get my black metalgreymon :D )I'm leaving a negative review score due to reason that this game needs urgent changes and I hope devs will do something about it. there is no reason why this game couldn't be good. All I want is a brand new UI and redesign of some maps. Also if there were some type of minigames between players that would be neat !",0

4037,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,"This is a fun game. Can be a little unbalanced at times, and sometimes you get stuck with a derp team. But it is fast paced, within only a day of game time I've already reached the point where you actually have to grind a little to earn the next tier tank. I think this game has alot of potential.Edit: After a few Days of ""Grinding"" I think its only fair to update my review.First off, the teams are rarely useful, Tier IV tanks are also rarely useful. I cant tell you how many matches I've played where everyone just up and leaves you to fend for yourself, which only dooms your team. And dont even get me started on the HUGE gap between Tier IV and Tier V tanks. at leas in Tier I - IV you can damage the enemy, I've played the German, Japanese, and American Skill tree (working on the Russians now) and I can tell you Tier V's are way too over Armored, even using Premium Ammo I only damage them maybe 1 out of ever 6 shots. and its never enough to actually contribute.Grinding in this game to get from Tier IV to Tier V means you join as many battles as you can and Watch your win ration slowly go down. Earning a mear 150 to 200 xp per match until you have the staggering 15k xp it takes to research a Tier V.... With all that said, Tier I - III is super fun and usually fairly balanced. I still see potential in this game.",1
12547,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewOf all of the recently made card games, this one is by far the worst in terms of anger-inducing mechanics.  The key to victory in at least 50% of the games I play is being the player that doesn't get mana-screwed.  This leaves victory feeling hollow (I won because my opponent couldn't play anything) and defeat feeling frustrating (I had an answer to that card in my hand but I couldn't play it).  The only positive is the nostalgic feeling I get from playing a game similar to magic.  Unfortunately, the game has not tried to improve from magic at all.",0

1438,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFrom what I've played, while not a heap, I can definatly say that, YES it is in development, but even so, still provides a challenging gameplay mechanic that isnt really seen in games these days.Controling these massive ships is difficult and yet somehow simple while using the weapons is a breeze, and takes influences from third person shooters (aim, then click) and on top of managing everything, making a stratagy to win the match.I'd really like to see this game fleshed out more in the future, which I'm sure is coming, but for now, the gameplay is solid with a surprisingly good tutorial (and the O K system is awesome, I'd like to see the controls page be dynamic with changes in your keybinds, but thats just me) and the menu is well laid out and presented neatly, and for an early access game, thats all you need.Servers are alright, I'd like to see more reigons in the server list, but I'm Australian, so apparently I dont matter. xDGraphics are good, but sometimes locks up in highly demanding moments (like their hyper jump or what ever they are calling it)Basically, a great space opera with pretty good gameplay and decent (yet to improve) graphics.TLDR: Its really good, you should buy it, its like Star Citizen, but real.",1

16534,Elsword,2014.0,"elsword..... elsword elsword elsword.well there isnt much to saybut its your typical  pay to win type of game, but what i like about this game is that you can gain some items by just ranking up and getting them from quests.the animation and visual effects of the game is pretty good too, does feel like a comic book in a way. the beat em up mechs works fine too, but they need to put more combos into the characters since x and z are the only buttons to hit for swinging a sword or wand. theres also specials, but you need to level them up for able to take critical damage from them. one problom i have with the game tho is the limited storage space they give you when it comes to your inventory, if you want extra space, you need to buy it. the pvp in the game is ok, but will tire out your fingers if your not used to quick doging, speaking of which, its a skill you have to unlock, you only near dogeing tatic is by jumping or running away.the players on elsword are mostly quiet, rarely do you find people talking to each other, but when you do, its a guild thats doing so or a group of hipsters.but the game is quite exciting and enjoyable to play for a few hours, at first, leveling up is simple, but when you reach level 25 and higher, it slows down. not to mention some quests or equipment require a level to play or use.if you dont spend any money on the game, you can still enjoy it, but prepare yourself on spending time clearing your inventory alot, since you gather items like crazy.i would give elsword a 8 out of 10",1

9477,Star Trek Online,2018.0,"Well, what to say about Star Trek Online... Steam says 1900 hours, but i bet its like 2200 already without the Steam Client. i played it from the beginning, not constantly , but now and then with friends. Is it old and feels a bit clunky? Yes. Could it use an overhaul? Yes. Is it good? Hell yes! Even with its outdated graphics and technology, this game is still somewhat addictive and fun, especially when you play it with friends. It is a free to play model, that is true. But most content (also endgame related content) is free and you can gain it via missions and work. The so called ""grind"" is something that you can do on a stand-by, since its literally getting some simple ressources (5 - 10 min work) and then clicking on ""earn reputation"" , and wait 20 hours to complete the task. That is literally all you have to do for ""endgame content"". No hours and hours of hard work with repetetive fighting and gathering. While the graphics isnt something everyone likes, this game gives you a very good executed story with hours of voice-overs, interesting missions and complete customization. You want your crew to wear a special uniform? Go for it! You want to customize your own skills, your crew skills and the weaponry of your character, your crew (away team) AND your ship? Go for it! You dont like Starfleet? You would rather play a deceptive Romulan with their cool ships, or a warmonger Klingon with a massive dreadnought? Go for it! This game has massive customization options, hundrets of ships, and an interesting take on ""Quests"". You hate being send to get some random drops like wolf-fangs or bear-claws with your task being slaughtering hundrets of monsters to finally get the drops to your npc? Well, Star Trek Online has NONE of such quests. Every single mission is literally a story, with you and your crew flying through the galaxy to distant planets and fighting huge battleships with torpedos, phasers and disruptors, but also holstering your guns and rifles and beaming down to get into dangerous close quarter combat in an enemy base to rescue hostages or find artefacts. True, they could have done the controls a bit better, but if you are able to literally adjust your controls and keymapping  to your liking, you will have alot of fun. I only say: ""Switch to shooter mode!"" , and turn your mmo in a third person shooter. If you are a Star Trek Nerd, you even can write your own log files. Oh, you have done all the story missions, and raids and fleet actions are nothing for you? How about you play one of the ten-thousands of missions of the foundry? Its a pool of community created missions that are mostly checked by the developers and being rated by players. Even there you have voice over. There is literally ""endless ingame content"" if you are searching for missions and quests en mass. And if you are a munchkin who likes to jingle a bit with numbers and calculations about the best gear, visit the Star Trek Online wiki and loose your mind about how much you can learn and do here. XDDont let yourself get tricked by ""only"" 3 classes... engineer, tactical or science. The class choice is literally only for selecting your base-abilities of ""you wanna do damage"" , ""you wanna heal or control"" or ""you wanna have a mixture of both"" . You can be a tactical player with grenades, supressing fire and damage buffs, while also flying a science ship or a cruiser. You are not bound by class, and you can literally choose your skills freely. All in all, i can promise that the game offers many options and gameplay mechanics that may be unusual for an mmo, but if you can overlook its age and the sometimes little technical problems, you will find a gem that can literally brighten up your day. Do some ships or species cost money? Yes, but honestly, this game has potential to entertain you far more than any actuall tripple A title with their usual 20 hours of storyplay, so you can honor the developers hard work with a few bucks to spend on this game. If i am generous with my calculation and even say a tripple A title would have 30 hours of entertainment in storyline, i would have had to buy 66 games to entertain me that long like Star Trek Online did. So yeah, have my 20 bucks for a nice endgame ship and let me play some more. ^^",1

17853,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is hard for me. I love this game but as of OB64 I couldn't recommend it. I just can't. The whole big deal with OB64 is they're changing up the cards that make they game....well fun. Giving them 10 whole ranks to level up and the only means to making them better is to get dupes of said card. The old system was a 12 point system that you divided amongst 5 cards. You can get some pretty unique builds from the whole cast of characters. Now its just a cluster ♥♥♥♥.With invulnerable characters, unbalanced cards, cards that make no sense at rank 10, and nerfing decent champions into oblivion I can't recommend this game.

8213,Digimon Masters Online,2017.0,"Really disppointed. This whole game is like a bad 2000's-era FTP MMO.The translation is HORRIBLE the worst I've ever seen. It makes no sense. Things like ""Do the right click to click on Tutorial NPC"" The graphics are pitiful, bland, boring, stretched out textures, ugly edges even with the AA turned on max, and the game is a clear point-and-click game but for some reason they tacked on WASD movement to it so you can't point-and-click to move.The introduction is poorly written and makes no sense. You can barely grasp what is even going on, and not in a good way. The story isn't ""mysterious"" its just downright nonsense. I ""played"" for like 20 minutes, if you can call an unskippable, unintelligible, and clunky tutorial, ""playing"" the game. And then it crashed to desktop with an unknown error.Just garbage. I don't understand. Bandai-Namco obviously created this game with no regard for the Digimon brand just to be a cash grab off the Digimon name. Of course saw their was a cash shop in the game, surprise surprise.No thanks. Do not support this game, I encourage someone to make a better one. Maybe then is the only way horrible companies like this will realize that and put some effort into their game. ",0

Why? World of warcraft doesnt even restrict faction numbers. Thats so stupid. Forcing people to play on another faction and not with there friends is just ridiculous.  > I heard the game is going to be reworked but why even release it? Why not rework it and then release the game into a state thats actually more presentable.> This translation of this game looks like someones english patch used to play on asian servers. Its a puzzle honestly.> The action combat is missing even though that was one of the most anticipated features of this game. It currently feels very clunky.> When I bought the founder pack my outfits for my mount and pet were only 30 days??? I doubt the founder pack why arent they permanent. Once I saw it was going to be that kind of transaction system I just refunded it. > No end game. So what do people do once theyre each 45? Its only been two days and people are ready for end game stuff. This game should not have been sold to people at its current state. There isnt nothing in it worth these prices.

8223,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewCan offer great fun at 0 cost. If you play the game for the dailies and in between other activities/games, you can be competitive and/or have fun.Has a short single player campaign that works more as a tutorial. From holding your hand on the first steps, to chasing after you with a M9A1-7 flamethrower. Campaign includes rewards. From single random cards to entire starter decks.Aside from the campaign, single player offers a puzzle mode, for mediocre rewards. The main focus of the puzzles is entertainment. However, a lot of the puzzles offer insights on obscure mechanics that otherwise would take a lot of experimenting to figure out.The Gauntlet mode (also under single player) is what the name implies: go through all the bouts with an increasingly difficult AI to recieve Gold (the F2P currency) and cards/card packs. It is free to participate in, which is reasonable, given the rage it induces with BS AI. At higher tiers, for people that are there for just the Gold, it is very punishing, as a singl defeat takes you out and not until the fifth out of seven victories will you start seeing any worthwhile rewards.The Forge mode is a cheaper draft mode, against the AI. As it is cheaper, the rewards are also inferior. Accessible to new players and good to fetch faction specific colors. Win or lose, you get to keep the picked cards. Forge mode forces you to use a 2 color deck, so you can limit what you get with the first few picks. If you win all your fights, you should get enough Gold to participate again (even a bit of profit)Under the PvP flag, you have the Casual and Ranked game types, which are common in most games these days. There is a season reward for Ranked and Draft (more on this game type below). Casual and Ranked are free to compete in.There is also an Event mode under the PvP section, which varies. I do not recommend participating unless you have a good collection. Otherwise you'll just be feeding other people, getting reward packs at regular value and wasting precious currency that could be better spent under Forge orDraft. A very generous draft system. You pick 48 cards out of 4 packs, paying a bit extra for this opportunity (20%). Victory or loss will get you the 48 cards, but do try your best as rewards aren't shabby at all, and if you score nice on the rank ladder you get even more rewards (even being bad, if you participate in 5 Draft sets, you will get at the very least an extra pack at the end of the season).Topping this off, you have daily (doable) quests that can be exchanged once per day for a different quest. Also, you have periodic theme quests (3 days, I think?) where you get a free theme deck and are asked to win 5 times with a deck with those colours (not necessarily the one offered).It is a very good game. Do yourself a favour and go through the basic campaign and play 2/3 matches in each game mode before you come to a decision.",1
199,Brawlhalla,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewA good game. It's very simple and easy to pick up, yet the skill level for this game is extremely high.

18009,Fishing Planet,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game's sales pitch is ""realism"".You go to the bank and fish pike, you throw out the perfect combo for pike at the perfect location.You fish 100 pikes in 1 hour.Pike is a territorial fish. If you catch a pike, it is highly unlikely that a new pike will inhabit that territory the same day.Now imagine 100s of pikes taking over that exact same territory within minutes of each other.Along with this it is plagued by P2W, some tackles can only be bought with ""special currency"", yes you can get it from challenges, but you get ~1 coin from a challenge and you need 30 coins for a simple tackle, must feel good to lose it due to snag when used.However, I do much enjoy the overall concept of the game and the relaxing aspect.I will recommend this when I see basic improvements, like pond population in both single/multiplayer scenarios and the aforementioned problem I stated at the top.Along with some other wierd bugs like the ""Happy Fish"".I would also very much like a ""GoPro Camera"" feature, so I can see fish chasing my bait.+ the ability to fish on a boat in lakes and oceans, sharks?Concept: 8/10Graphics: 7/10Gameplay: 6/10 (Overall it is ok, but bugs must be fixed to increase immersion)Atm, the game feels like an Early Access game, not yet ideal.Seen some nasty comments about the Devs taking it into the wrong direction, so I'll keep this review as a Not Recommended as of now until I'm satisfied.",0

Learning these skills, (rocket jumping, spys mindtricks, building placements etc. is extremely hard but rewarding) Also the character responsibilty in competetive game is quite massive.And then there is the humongously large itemworld, you can create character sets from so many items, that its extremely rare to find someone whit exact same set. You can earn items by random drops by just playing, and crafting them to better ones later on. Or you can play MvM tours to get quite rare ones, or open boxes.And the best part is that the items do not give you better stats, instead they give you option to play differently.Summary: Youll get grazy action like no other, skills hilarious comedy, the community is the best ive seen in a game this popular, and free updates that have been distributed for many years.Best of all, its Fun to play and competetive at the same time.Cheers GabeN",1

The expansions are limited to Standard format too, which might disappoint some players looking for cards they've enjoyed in past versions of Duels. And it sure would be nice if matched play gave some amount of coins to players that lose matches but stick around to finish the match.

17201,GUNS UP!,2018.0,"TL;DR1) Cross Platform Play between PSN and PC (tablet?) -not sure,2) Candy for Obsessive Organizers/ Trolls3) Grind-centric with or without cash investment4) Gentle learning-curve47 hrs in, lvl 24 ..and yes, i spent money ($ 40) on in-game purchases. Guns Up ia a F2P, Pay-to-Grow-Faster, yes that much is true.. however I've found out that some items [suchas Legendary Perk Cards, and Legendary HQ cards] can only be obtained through purchases or the expensive chests.10 keys for Resource Chest, 15 for HQ, etc. after 47 hrs i only have 4 KEYS. Granted, these can be obtained easier through Alliance Battles.in summation.. GRIND< GRIND< GRIND. ugh.this game is a lot of fun. I (personally) <3 Tact. Build/ Tower-Def. type games & this game has oodles of variety. While reading some of the other reviews I noticed player complaints about ""KILL BOXES"" ,and similar scumbag strategies. However, if you're not willing to break your bank on this game, you might consider these as advantages. I've been K-O'd by crafty KILL BOXES enough times to learn from my failures. Slowing an advancing army down is a useful strategy. Try lining up your walls to form an S pattern and create Bottle-necks, or Corridors for maximum effectiveness.

228,AdventureQuest 3D,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI am still very much on the fence about this game. However, since it is very much Alpha, I will give it a positive review for now. There are A LOT of gripes to be had about this game, but when you boil it down, it is an easy going, all right RPG. However, the gripes will hopefully be put to rest when more updates come out.1) Dying, Kill 1, Dying, Kill Another, Dying...This is a major gripe of mine. AoE spells do nothing but aggro enemies and make you die faster. You may say, well, just level up and get better equipment. The problem is that the dungeon already sets you to a particular level, and your spells, needless to say, suck and it becomes a button masher.2.) Attack range...Now this is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to say the least. You can attack at melee range, but unless you are really close to the enemy, the enemy will auto heal and you will lose your chance to continue to use spells...annoying.3.) Grindfest...Now I don't really mind it in this game, but you might. The ENTIRE game is a grindfest. And combine that with gripe #1, it becomes tedious and clumbersome.Yeah, I don't know why I gave it a positive recommendation.",1

8203,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI played magic the gather about 15-20 years ago with a couple friends. Never got in to it because I wasn’t going to spend an absurd amount on cards.  Saw this, hey its free and thought I’d give it a try.From the free perspective the local content is pretty easy going. Cards and how everything works isn’t too difficult to understand, even for someone like myself that hasn’t had the opportunity to play these kinds of games much. The causal games against other players is also rewarding.  You start seeing some ingenuity and coming up with your own as well. Makes things interesting.  Once you start ranked games I did pretty poorly. Some of it was luck of the draw and of course bad discussions due to lack of experience no doubt. The complexity of the cards and people playing multiple races/color decks makes the things more difficult to understand. An example of this if you an enemy unit card 2-2 and yours is 2-3 you know your unit will win so you would choose to attack or defend with it. After you executed that action cards come in to play to buff their unit or hurt your unit and you lose your card without you knowing going in.  Course the same could be said for the other team, just know going in your going to need to practice and gain experience. I played for quite a while, had a good time.  I have like 5k of gold but there seems no where to spend it. To advance from here and get better cards and build decks it appears it’s pay to win on the ranked side of things.If your looking for something casual and free the causal games this is a good pick. Good replay value, I’ll no doubt enjoy revisiting playing casual games.  If they implemented a system to be able to grind the cards and deck, such as being able to use the gold you get from winning then I could see my self playing a great deal more.  I’d do a one-time payment to “buy the game” to gain access to everything everyone else has. If you’re not in to microtransaction and play to win the scope of how far you can go is pretty limited. But you can obtain casual entertainment out of it, for free.  My motto is, if its free, it’s for me!  ",1
1822,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter moving away from MtG and wanting to play a more complex virtual CCG than Hearthstone, this game scratched my card game itch perfectly. The game is extremely generous for Free-to-Player players and is very easy to pick up if you have experience with Magic. Eternal has not too much clicking, but still leaves players plenty of time to interact with each other. The community overall is great and players are very willing to help or provide you with information.Downsides:The game can be difficult to pick up if you have no prior card game experienceNot explaining phases or response windows can make it hard for new players to understand exactly what is going on ",1

2388,Dungeon Defenders II,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI loved the first dungeon defenders so much. Just total stupidety of the weapons and pets you could have. Using and archer with a many gun while your Team Fortress Pyro is shooting flames around you, Hell yeah.I was really looking forward to this game, expecting the same experience as DD 1, but hell i have been disappointed. First of al the pre-order, i dont mind supporting the Devs for this game, but the fact that it is free to play now is kind of questionabel for me. But the most dissapointing thing of all is the lack of 'fun'. I could play DD1 all day every day, feeling like it was a new game everytime i played with endless possibilities. The pets were really interesting and the weapons were ridicilous but that made it so fun to play. So ofcourse i buy the new DD2, but where is the fun? Every level feels like the lever before that, i just doesn't have the fun factor as DD1. And it has been in pre alpha for hella long. The updates don't feel right, just more stuff you can get for real $$ or €€. It sucks, it is cruisin towards a game where, if you want to beat all the levels, you just have to pump your hard earned money in it.  Beside this fact all those new chars/heroes coming out. I pre ordered it for a lot of money, and know you are saying i dont get the new chars unless i pay another 20 dollars? Or i have to play for a loooot of hours. Me no likie. For a F2P game this game can/is really fun. But for the Dungeon Defenders fan, we better get back playing DD1, where the fun was real. ",0
6455,EverQuest II,2014.0,"I purchased this game back and 2008 and only played the 30 day free trial but didnt feel like it was worth the subscription fee at the time as I probably didnt put enough time into. When everquest 2 extended came out I downloaded it too but never ended up really playing it as I just couldnt get into it.Finally I decided to play it again now that it was Free to Play. Fist I downloaded the standalone client and played for quite sometime and began enjoying the what I was able to do in this game and what the future had in store for this game. When I noticed it was on steam I reinstalled it on here and Iv been playing non stop eversince. One of the huge perks I found as I was playing was I had recieved tons of free ingame goods such as housing items, 500 Station Cash I didnt know I had and tons and tons of other bonuses I had recieved from purchasing and registering the game back on 08. This really had me sucked in now as even though most of the goods were not entirly powerful or usful for adventuring it really gave me a glimps of what I could do in the game. Especially with housing.Graphics:This is obviously a game that is getting up in age and the graphics do show in this way, however it seems like this was the perfect time for graphics engines because a lot of these games still look really good. Its not all blocky and cluncky like a ps1 game or everquest one but its smooth and has really nice looking landscapes, armor sets ect. It all just rolls out to look so good for its age. There are tons of settings that you can dink with to make it look as good good as you need it and its garenteed youll probably be able to find what looks best for you depending on your pc spec. In some of the main hub towns, especially freeport, the frames dropped crazy low. Im not sure if its a server issue or my internet. Its not so laggy that its unplayable by any means especially due to the fact that main cities are more or less used for grabbing quest, crafting, trading which means you wont need as many frames anyways to do these smaller faster taskes.Gameplay:Iv sunk so much time into this game so fast too. I dont think iv been able to dedicate myself to an mmo from the start as quick as I did with this game; despite me not giving it the chance in the first place. Im still not even at the level cap of 95... Wait I read they raised it to 100 hahaha. Thats pretty awesome in itself to me because it means i still have a ton of content to buzz through plus the latest expansion pack. So far as of this review Im level 54 and I dont even really feel the game is a grind. It just leaves me wanting to play more.The questing type for the most part is standard kill so and so or get me this many of this thing but it does thow in some quests where unique items are given to you and that item is used to summon a boss for instance or special goggles to help you find clues. Even though it has so many of the standard quests I actually prefer them over the other quests wheree the special items are required. There usually less tetius and go quicker and this results in faster xp and gold and sick♥♥♥♥♥quest item rewards. This being said I still love the bit of variety it does have and it keeps me wanting more. This game has made me fall in love with running dungeons. In the Guildwars games dungeons were always pretty fun with friends or a good group but they generally require you to wait around for a group or use there sick♥♥♥♥♥dungeon finder to get a group together. This is all well and sweet and pretty flawless for guildwars 2 but I like how I can freely run a dungeon alone or with a group here in everquest 2. It just depends on your level and ability. Theres the flipside to that. You can also run the dungeons with people when your at a lower level or whatever so that option is obviously still there I guess the problem with it is though, is finding a group of people around who want to help you and not just clear the whole place out a few seconds before you. I tuely feel that there dungeon matchmaking needs to be improved because I find it confusing as♥♥♥♥♥♥or not very functional at the time. It would be amazing if they incorperated a mega server type idea like Guildwars 2 as that solution in my opinion is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. I swear if Everquest 2 and Guildwars 2 had some awesome♥♥♥♥♥sex, that would be my dream game born.The game is free to play and is probably one of the most honest free to play games I looked into for the most part. Although most f2p models are coming around. It never forces you to purchase anything and you honestly have little of a need to spend a dime. I however got sucked in a bit but paying to research some skills faster or upgrade them to the Master Tier. I also bought some cool white armor skins which you obvously dont need. Iv also spent some station cash for instant repairs of my armor because I didnt feel like traveling back to town but repair men are all over and not to hard to find for the most part. I also sub'd last month and this month so I could adjust my alternate experience slider to give me more adventure xp for a few months but this was just something I wanted to test and it is a nice added feature but the free 50 percent option is still more the viable and works behind the scenes so you dont even need to think about it. Being at 50 percent Adventure experince also didnt feel like a grind when I was playing free, it just felt standard and A nice shinny option that was there if I ever chose to pay to use it. My best purchase so far though that most people may want to concider adding is the Mercinaries pack which allows you to hire an AI companion that helps you in battle. Not only does it make leveling a little faster before level 50 it also makes it alot faster and combat will be alot easier with a merc, escpecally when when fighting mobs of heroic characters. I chose to purchase this extra fairly early on in the game with my real world cash as the higher the level you are in the game the more ingame gold he will cost to hire. Buying this pack also allows you to summon tour merc no matter where you are. I dont use him a ton unless im running a dungeon alone so he is not to pricey for my in game budget but it is something that I sort of felt like I was missing before I purchased the addon. This just might be me though. Playing the game without a merc is entirely doable you just might need to find a buddy instead and be a little social or if you have the addon find some buddies and bring mercs too.♥♥♥♥♥♥will hit the roof im assuming.I guess I was a little slow in the head because I didnt find the storyline quests in my log until my early 20s I think. Man I was jacked when I found these though. They gave me more to shoot for. A reason to play and read these quests. I was having a ton of fun just running sidequests and getting the rewards and when I found the storyline quests and they even better loot they offered I got pulled in more and it gave me all new reason to keep playing. One of the story missions game me a Raptor like mount for a reward. I was pretty pumped about that even though I already bought a horse. The raptor was slow though and had the ability to almost jump and glide. The gliding was cool but I was like ♥♥♥♥ this things way to slow so i never used it. Now however im in higher level areas which require more climbing or going around mountains. While I swapped to my raptor and there was no more going around big long hills I could now set my tracker to where the mobs were and jump right over the big cliffs until I got there. Its been saving me a ton of time. Now im just in the middle of the content and im still having a ton of fun.Daily achievments are also pretty fun and quite easy to get. Completing 2 will give you loyalty tokens that you actually want to spend. Now I have 33 token and im saving up for a wild ♥♥♥♥ing mansion for 65 or something. Its worth it and easy to collect.

1653,Aura Kingdom,2014.0,"I've been playing a lot more than it says I have on Steam, but I recently downloaded it again from Steam because I'm weird like that and I like all my games to be in Steam if possible.Anyways, this is a real gem in an ocean of crap F2P games.  Good:--------------------------Awesome story that makes sense and is easy to followBeautiful world, amazing attention to detail and a real joy to just look aroundThe things you can buy from the store can also be earned (usually in several different ways) from in-game things as well or you can easily and *safely* earn free Aeria Points by installing and playing apps on your phone or watching a minute long video.Translation is spot on.  I haven't seen any issues and usually with games like this half the quest text makes 0 sense.As you progress you have several ways of changing and making yourself better.  From talent trees to mastering skills to adding gems, enchants and fortifying armor and weapons.Great sense of humor.A lot of classes to choose from which are not sex locked.Lots of different looks without even mentioning costumes and dyes and all of that, I'm just talking about character creation.Every day you log back in you are greeted with a free present and your Eidolon as well.Eidolons.  These are exceptionally well done ""battle pets"" (bascially) with stories and personalities all of their own.  They don't just level, you help them to level and to better themselves as you progress as well.  Not only are there several to choose from or earn but they all have their own way of speaking, seeing the world and battling.  Some are healers, others plain warriors and so on.  They can be evolved at certain levels with the right items, given items to up their stats permanently, you have conversations with them on a regular basis and they give you great gifts which can help both of you a lot in the long run.  This is by far, one of the most impressive battle pets systems I have ever seen in any game, and it's free to play!  Auto-route.  I have no idea why, some people see this as a bad thing but I don't understand that at all.  You can open the map up, find a specific NPC and just run to them without having to worry.  I don't see a problem with this and with all of the other types of games I have played, I just see it as it's own game mechanic.  You don't have an ""auto kill everything"" feature so it isn't game breaking in the least.  If you don't like it, just don't use it.  I see this as only a plus and will not name this as a con for any reason.The way they did quests is not only pretty clever, it's also very fun.  When you approach an NPC and click on them to start a quest a small box will take over your screen.  You can then watch the interaction between your character and the NPC as they engage in quest conversation.  It's really cute, allows you to cut off the rest of the MMO world for a moment to get into what you are doing and also lets you see the amount of emotions displayed in a really fun way.  I really like it.I've played four different classes, all of which had spells and attacks that were very different from one another.  Battle Bow looks nothing like another class, which some of these F2P MMOs do and it is very boring.  The attacks and spells in this game are vibrant, fun, fast-paced and well thought out.  You cannot just mash buttons either, which I really appreciate.  You have a global cooldown on all abilities.  Speaking of abilities, you can do a combo with your Eidolon.  It is unique to each one and does a ton of damage.  Even the healer types have one they can do with you.  Very fun, awesome to watch.Auto-potions.  I love this feature as well and will not say this is a con either, for any reason.  You don't like it don't use it.  I don't care, I think this is awesome.  What this does is allow you to place whatever type of potions you have in your bags in the Auto-potion slot.  You can then click it ""On"" and choose a percentage of health in which to have it switch to.  I have mine at 30% and it has seriously helped.  This allows you to focus on the action (you'd just be clicking it anyways, don't waste the global cooldown) while staying somewhat safe.  This does not gaurantee that you will stay alive.  This is not a 100% proof plan against death.  You can still die.  Don't kid yourself.  Some of the daily instances are just mean.  But this feature is just really awesome and I've never seen it before in any MMO.  That I remember.Lots and lots to do.  You have cooking done in a unique fashion, bring items you find randomly around the world to special cooks in the towns and they can help you fuse up something amazing.  Sometimes it's green, sometimes it's orange and you will get an achievement and exp for doing so.  Sometimes it's purple and helps specifically with PvP!  There are thousands of hidden quests and achievements in every area of the game.  From finding green question marked items and finishing the tasks lined up with them, to gathering loyalty points that you can also use in the item mall for lots of really cool items without spending a single penny.  Or chase down the 4-6 unique monsters in each area and turn in their pots to the city/village jailer for extra goodies and more achievements/titles.  Everything on the UI can be moved anywhere you want it.  The UI itself is great looking and you can even shrink or enlarge all of the elements.Lots of different ways of doing quests.  I have noticed some people saying it's the same as many other MMOs and there is a lot of grinding.  I don't think this is true at all.  Yes, you kill enemies and you collect items but there is a LOT more than just that going on.  Sometimes you are dodging the eyes of the bad guys trying to get through a dungeon or winning over the baddy in order to help you later on.  Planting bombs, fishing, sneaking through very dangerous areas.  There's more than just the normal amount of ""kill this"" and ""collect that"".  Plus, it actually makes 100% sense as to WHY you are doing it.  it isn't just ""my farm is in danger kill 5000 beetles"".  You are killing those things and collecting those items in order to help finish a much bigger picture which I think is really cool.  The kill quests and collection items aren't over done either.  At most I have been asked to kill 10 things at one time.  Not a big deal to me at all.Auto join a guild, get benefits and never be bothered.  Or bother them and start a conversation.  It's literally up to you.  I love this feature, I wish every game had something like this.  ----------------------Bad:Not a lot of character slots available, only three without paying.Bots.  They aren't a huge deal and literally only sit in one place of each zone that I have noticed, but it's really annoying.  They are always the guys with the big cannon looking things, I can't remember the name of the class.  They all look the exactg same and have ridiculous names.  Just annoying.Sometimes it is a little too easy.  You feel like you are just sweeping through everything.  This could be a good thing to some, I don't see it that way though so am only naming it as a con.  I would like there to be much more challenge.  The daily instances offer something more, but only rarely and for the most part they aren't too hard either.Bag space.  They will give you bags and stuff from time to time and all but really there isn't much at all.  Especially your bank.  It is TINY and I really hate that.  You have a shared bank which is awesome but it is just too small.Cooking things requires far too much money.  I don't spend my money on much else really.  I get items from dungeons and such and don't want to spend it on AH crap or personal sellers.  But fusing together some cooked chicken costs much too much.  You share Eidolons with your account.  This can be good and bad.",1

17659,Crush Crush,2017.0,"(Intro)i've had this game over a year and only now have the idea of writing a review, eh, here goes...Crush Crush, a idle game with elements of a visual novel dating sim, great idea, right? RIGHT! this game is FUN, really, REALLY FUN! so, lets dive in, shall we?The Good Things:------------------Gameplay/idea: i already talked about this in the intro, but the idea is really cool! and the gameplay is good for an idle game, unlike others... a-hm clicker heroes, but yeah, pretty damn good gameplay for a idle game, so try it out! the gameplay does NOT disapoint. =DArt/Artstyle: im not the biggest fan of anime, but i do have injoy how much work must have gone into drawing, designing, and the anatomy of characters, and this game make each and every character unique with their own personalites!  i love them all! (kind of the whole point if you think about it) lets go over a few! one have a gamer, a furry, pornstar, someone from the future, a BEAR, a sex god, a hologram singer, and many more! (also yan-chan from yandare sim) injoy all the love-able! (and slightly un-love-able) characters!The Bad Things----------------Time taking: to infinty! and infinty, and infinty... and infin- this game takes ,FOREVER, like i said in the intro, i've been playing this for over a year, AND I HAVENT FINSHED IT YET, i think that because i did a total game reset (aka hard reset) cause i thought i wasnt progressing, i regret doing that now, even though im not much farther then when i reset, i'll talk more about this in the end, but like i said, this takes, FOREVER. events: like any idle game, to spice things up a bit, sad panda studios start making seasonal events, like easter and summer break, all that jass, at first, it was okay, look around the game menu's, find little click-ables, get cool pin-up pictures (with ya gals) then, they mixed it up a bit, with everyday hunt-for-something events (if you play the game you'll understand what i mean) log on everyday, new thing everyday, find them all, get pinup/outfit, fine and dandy, for some i find the events fine, but for others, i can understand whats to get mad about, (not un-install the game levels of bad, but just a little annoying) you cant plan not having internet for a few days, or if you need to go somewhere for a meeting for your job cause you dont wanna be FIRED, i understand, thats what i dont like about events (i dont have a job, cause im 13, but still, events gotta go back to the way they were)Ending/advice---------------welp, that was a barrel of words, but you mad it though! so, here is some of my advice for the gamesoft reset: each idle game has a soft reset, this game is no diff, so heres how you should do it, as soon as it says, you should reset (the first and only time) you should, its small but helpful, and later down the road, i sugest that you soft reset after you finsh a new girl down the road (untill you reach that baker, i sugest you just reset after you reach the last part of her quests to gain that bikini pic, you'll understand when you play it)welp, thats all i got to say, play the game ya dumbies! its fun! rating? i dont do ratings... anymore at least...Injoy This Free Game! - Anthonino ",1

From previous experiences with AQ games i understand many people are frustrated with there use of in game purchases that block most of the game from the f2p community and its true, but from my 10 hours the only thing i've seen that limits F2p is the one extra class and the optional pre-order for when the game releases.",1

What you don't pay with your money you pay with your health.Used to be a great game, now it's a pro-fascist propaganda tool.- Toxic community (mostly US servers)- Untolerable disbalance in favor of fascist factions in tank battles so you're stuck grinding for silver even tho grinding is already bad in the game.- Excessive grinding in rank 5 and up EVEN with premium (paid).- Overpriced content.- Biased in-game admins who block users for no other reason than to just responding into chat unless they are pro-fascist/us in which case even cursing is allowed and goes unpunished, I've seen it happen a lot.- Content milking, ie you activate a booster only to be mismatched against much higher opponents just so you can waste your boosters without profit even if you pay real money for it.- Once realistic balanced environment now makes legendary tanks look like cardboard boxes with turrets.- Limited coop which is at times severely restricted to paid content and forces players to play arcade game mode to even participate while supressing realistic gaming in the game (SB) with limited cycled events.- Installs an agent client that starts as a service. While it is only understandable that gaijin may want to grow someday and have own store like origin and uplay this agent is at times aggressive and cannot be stopped, it also conflicts with security tools.- Much more wrong with this game I won't even bother, just stay away from it.The only thing that is somewhat fun is simulator flight battles and that in particular if you play with friends, everything else has turned into toxic pool of competitive wasteland alike of cod and siege.

14299,Fractured Space,2018.0,"Immediatly fun because....space ships. Hidden depth and strats abound. the grind feels like alot at first but you quickly get ships and crew that you enjoy. Each ship feels very different & the crew you choose can add alot of personality to your ship as well, with sometimes badass other times funny commentary, and live combat responses. It doesnt just feel like driving an empty lifeless ship through empty lifeless space.Combat is mostly slow and methodical with bursts of of intense heavy firing action. When both teams are on point the battles are extremely rewarding. Its a game where position is everything. predicting enemy movement while also trying to win rock paper scissors. While at the same time you can be on the losing end of a type matchup and still come out on top with superior piloting and alot of heart.

809,PlanetSide 2,2018.0,"First things first:The game is controversial. Dont get fooled by my playtime. Combined with my time using the SOE launcher my gametime goes into multiple thousands of hours so here my advise.If u wanna go alone and just grind guns, stay away from it. You will find the grind tedious, you will be outgunned by people who are worse than you, but win because they gang up on you.Im not saying u cant have fun in the game going solo from time to time. I do so myself.The actual joy comes in when you become part of a team. Doesnt matter if you are an elitist in your small squad of energdrinking, doritoeating memelords or you are being a small part of a way bigger machine playing continent wide king of the hill. While doing so the certs u need for all of your upgrade will come along the way.Actual review:Overview:We have here an MMOFPS, in which u can play one of three factions (or all of them) that emphasives the management of population and the right form of deployment. In a nutshell, when u are bringing 12 guys deployed as light infantry and you are going against 48 players going at you combined arms style, you are in for a rough ride and should question the sanity of your squadlead.When two armies are managed properly and are going at each other. then you are in for an experience that is unrivaled across all games Im aware of.The factions you can play are supposed to be asymetricly balanaced, but in reality the only realy difference are the gunsounds with a different gimmick here and there. To make a perfectly inaccurate statement. NC: hits hard, fires slow. TR: has big magazines. VS: has fast reload speed and no bullet drop (the bullet drop isnt so handy though)Graphics and optimization:The graphics aged well. The game is from 2012 and on ultrasettings u will get some cool visuals. However the optimization is far from perfect, so u need a decent rig to able to play the game on low settings. Its recommended for all lowend rigs to completely turn of shadow and light effects.Gunplay:This game uses clientside. If you dont know what that means pls use google before you read on. The TTK when playing infantry vs. infantry is pretty high (6-8 hits). There are a lot of shiny things u can use use to upgrade you class, but they are not of any use if u dont understand clientside. People camping in corners will be in a disadvantage in this game. Also because of the high TTK, infantry combat is relatively close quarterish compared with other games.Vehiclegameplay:I wont go into ground vehicles here since, well everyone knows what they can expect from them. There are tanks, armoured trooptransports and what have ya. Not that different from what already exists IRL.However the airgame is different from u might have experience in other games. The flying vehicles in the game all kind of act like attack helicopters. This is due to the ability to hover that all airvehicle have. This turns dogfights into helicopter battles where the combatants usually face each other instead of getting on the six of one another. If u wanna be more than cannonfodder in the air you also need lots of practice since the more advanced manouvers are not really intuitive and need practice. There are some good vids on youtube for that.PSW? :There is nothing currently avaiable in the game that cant be earned through just playing the game. However camos and other cosmetics are only dropped when u win an alert and its a random drop.So if u really wanna have a certain shiny thing on your armor u might help out your grandpa in the garden and invest the moneys u get there in shinys.All other things can be aquired by certification points that u get every 250 xp points or so. As stated above if you are just playing this game for the grind, while also going solo, u will have a hard time to aquire the certs u want to unlock the much needed upgrades on you utility slots.General advise: The basic guns u get to start with are the most versatile. Investing your first certs in the actual class abilites and slots will upgrade your char more than a 1k cert gun that u just bought because some good players use it.There are implants in the game that can be bought in lootboxes, with certs or with real cash. I think the mechanic is problematic but the implants are not. These implants give you tiny or nice to have gimmics that improve the qulity of life but dont make you inherently stronger. You can have the best implants in the game. When you dont know how to clientside u still get rekt.It is worth noting here, that if the main continent (the one with most population) often has a queue to get into if u play the faction with most population. If u aquire membership (also give a bit more xp) u will be treated with priority.I cant give definitive answer here since I guess that the whole PSW needs more definition. I can tolerate it.",1

928,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"Consensus: Has every single problem with these types of card games and worse. Honestly one of the worst pay to win games I've ever come across. At least Hearthstone lets you earn broken card packs through daily challenge but with the Elder Scrolls: Legends you actually have to pay REAL MONEY to earn them. A very good chuck of the cards are locked behind a paywall which is honestly the worst thing you can do in a game especially when those cards are INSANELY GOOD.Positives:- Low card count makes the game easier for new players- Campaign mode for offline/learning opportunities - Multiple combinations of classes.- Rewards for playing.- Ability to recycling unwanted cards.- Ranked gamemode with seasonal rewards.- It's free.Negatives:- Low card count means less variety in builds.- Campaign mode would insult anyone seriously invested in the current lore.- Classes are a dead giveaway of what the player is building. Some classes are clearly better than others.- Rewards aren't good, most of the time they give out unwanted duplicates.- Card recycling gives out terrible returns.- Ranked play isn't ranked. Everyone starts out at rank 0 so pros get paired with new players and it's a terrible experience for everyone involved.- Microtransactions everywhere.

19379,War Thunder,2016.0,"I do not recommend starting this game.Gaijin does not respect their players whatsoever, and make changes that undermine the quality of the game.Do not play this game.Almost everything else about it is frustrating, borderline infuriating atleast half the time. Its perversion of the MMO model, with ludicrous amounts of grinding, handpers most of its gameplay goals. The sunk value falacy will hit you very hard, Especially because it will take several hours before you can play anything beyond a pre-war biplane with a lawnmower engine or a tank that isn't just a sardine can. The damage model mechanics are a definite plus, But seriously I do not recommend starting this game. The balance of the game is extremely annoying, their system of intense uptiering and downtiering shoots shemselves in the foot in terms of actually acheiving consistent balance. High tier tank combat is FUBAR, the balance is ridiculous, and makes it not fun to play.Dont bother with this game unless you want to spend large amounts of time and money, but if you want to spend invest in a game just to feel sunk value, go ahead.Yes this review used to be a lot more scathing, because about a year ago the game felt like it deserved it.

3323,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI have a lot hours in this game and I think I can say its safe to say to not waste your time playing this game. Also the review I'm giving is strictly for people who are interested in finding and playing a card game more competively than casually. Let's start with the things that are just wrong about this game and shouldn't be in here.    - 75 Card Decks:    The decks that you make have to be 75 cards instead of the standard 60 that are common in most other games. This makes deckbuilding and playing with your deck an absolute nightmare. There are lists that you can find online that have the top tier decks in the game (and trust me I built them), but with 75 cards in the deck the consistency of drawing cards and the way the deck is supposed to play is significantly reduced. The deck size should be 60 cards, and then you have a 15 card side board (though sideboards don't matter in this game either and I'll explain later).    - Mulligan:       Doing the standard mulligan in this game is dumb. In this game if you don't like your seven card hand starter you have a chance to shuffle your cards and redraw another seven. Unfortunately you can only mulligan once for some reason, so if after you mulligan and your hand still sucks well that too bad cause youre stuck with it. Let me give you an example of how it should be. If you ever played Magic the Gathering (another better card game) before, the way their system works is like this, you start with seven cards if you don't like your starting hand you can shuffle and redraw cards down to six, if you still don't like your hand you can go down to four cards, if you still don't like your hand you can go down to three (though this never happens) etc, etc... The point is you have more say as a player on what hand you can get where as eternal complete restricts you for some reason.    - Coin Flip:      Normally when you play a card game there is some sort of coin flip for who goes first in playing. Eternal has this also but for some reason if you are picked you HAVE to go first. Now in other games when you do a coin flip, the winner has the option if they want to go first or not, I know it sounds weird but there are some times when you would rather not be the person going first (It doesn't happen always but trust me sometimes you will want to). This is more just a pet peeve of mind but it just goes to show how much eternal doesn't trust their player base to make their own decisions.     - Best out of ONE:       This is without the doubt the most annoying thing in the game and is so utterly frustating it is basically what made me not want to play anymore. For some reason ranked matches are a best of ONE, basically if you getting terrible starting hands you are guaranteed to lose the match and thus lose points on your rank. Sometimes in games you are bound to get unluckly  with draws but thats why in most other cards games when you play competively, you play your opponent the best of THREE. For the life of me I have no idea why the game is like this, I can't begin to tell you how absoultely frustated you will feel when you are playing ranked, and your starting hand is bad and you wish you could mulligan but you can't cause eternal only allows two for some reason, and you wind up losing the game cause of it, but not only that you lose points on trying to rank up. It's absoultley ridculous and it just goes to show that eternal is no where serious about competive play.     - Unbalanced Cards:       Some of the cards and game mechanics are straight up broken, and by that I mean you essentially have no way to lose. Some cards in this game are so grossly good that if you play them the opponent essientially has no way to win, the game basically becomes a race of who can play the best card first, I've played tons of other card games before (Magic, Hearthstone, Yu-gi-oh, Pokemon) and I can safely say that eternal has just some of the most ridiculous cards I've ever seen.     - Drafing sucks:       Finally the last point that I want to make is about how bad the draft system is set up in this game. For drafting in eternal you aren't drafting with a group of seven other people live like most other drafts normally go, instead you have a limitless amount of time to choose cards and packs will be rotated around to random people (there is a little more about how this works online if you want to look up exactly how drafting works here), these drafts aren't with a group so it essentially takes all the fun out of a draft because normally when people draft its fun to play against the people you were passing the packs around with to see what cards they took and what decks they built. Also eternal has done another weird thing where the deck you build for draft is 45 cards, this isn't as much of a big deal since you draft 48 cards in total but I just find it odd. Also draft matches are not the best out of three, they are again the best out of ONE. It's so dumb because in draft you get random cards that you pick from, so your deck is bound to have inconsistencies in it, so if you get awful hands well too bad f@#$ you cause now you lose the match.Here is the good things about Eternal...     - It's free and it will only take you 50 hours of grinding to get a semi good deck if you don't want to spend money.Overall, if you are looking for a card game to play online to take more seriously just go play Hearthstone,  Magic Online, or Magic Arena.",0
5421,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat game if you're into Sci-Fi and Mobas...Totally paid for it even tho it is Free to support the developers, I'd love to see this game have more content in the future!",1
2010,SMITE®,2016.0,"SMITE. A different kind of MOBA.So SMITE is a MOBA , just like League of Legends , DOTA 2 and Heroes of the Storm. Yet why do people play it instead of playing the games I metioned above? Well let me explain you. First of all SMITE is a third person game , so it gives the feeling of an adventure game more than a MOBA. That is indeed a nice change of pace in comparasion to other games. Second of all , SMITE doesn't just throw some random characters at you. You play as gods from different cultures which all have a connection and lore of their own. This game can help you learn quite a few things about mythology. Unlike other MOBAS , SMITE has a variety of game modes and maps. The game mode which stood out for me was Arena. In Arena the gods just basically go all out at eachother..in a arena! Seriously now don't be afraid to try SMITE , it's a really good game that can keep you busy from getting laid for a while.  8.0/10 - Good",1
14264,SMITE®,2017.0,"A Great Competitive Game to have fun with friends or play competitive.Interesting Game because you have alot of Gods of different Mythology and some gods have advantages on others because of their Mythology and origins which is really interesting in a game comparing to League of Legends i think this game is way more fun to play.I highly recommend it, if you want a great competitive and a really fun  game this 1 will entertain you alot.Explaining the concept of Gods having advantages on others.Each God has his differents habilities and strenght  his purpose in the game his role some gods can be stronger oppenents to others meaning his ""Mythology"" is greater then another god example He Bo is a god that controls massive and turbulent waters, also theres Poseidon the Greek god that also has habilities on water although did you know that Poseidon may be a god on ""SMITE"" but in his real lore you can search it if you want ""OFC"" Poseidon is considered a Semi-God, and He-Bo is definetly stronger than Poseidon in the game due to his massive bursting damage through out the Game, thats what i was trying to explain, although they might have certain advantages on others like im trying to say i mean bellona definetly has advantages on others due to her absorb and her abusive ""KIT"" i think you all got the point now, although despite minor advantages, a few kills on a GOD can make it  very OP and abusive through out the game so its the concept of having minor advantages on others is through there habilites and kits in the game but like i said despite minor advantages in game, each god can get a few kills and be a force to be dealt with in-game.Although its a minor concept about certain advantages with the gods it all depends on your team composition against the other gods, it will depend on your builds and how much you farm.Dont get greedy and think that picking Gods like He-bo, Scylla you will automatically win against other gods, no thats not the point here it will all depend on how you perform in the game.",1
4847,Magic Duels,2018.0,"If you are frugal, or maybe shy, this is easily the best incarnation of Magic around, though it lacks the real-world tabletop charm, or even a chat function. If you want to 'pay-to-win' you might as well collect the physical cards instead. The ranked match making is pretty spot on with fairly short wait queues. The game does move at a slow pace though, there can be a lot of downtime waiting for the other player to complete their turn, but you can also use that time to strategize. Unlocking new and duplicate cards feels rewarding. Deck management is much more convienant than shuffling physical cards around because of convinenant sort options. Also, no 3+ player mode other than 2 versus 2 some of the traditional Magic experience is inaccessible.",1
1446,Dota 2,2016.0,"I nominated this game for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" AwardYou have an early day tomorrow.

Yep, most of you can relate.Overall, it's a solid MOBA game, like one of the reviewer said, it's not pay to win, the in game purchases are for cosmetic purpose only. The cons is that this is MOBA game, means you play with people, and people can be annoying sometimes. Well, maybe a lot. But the game provided options to play with AI, so you can still play alone.My Score - 9/10 for the game5/10 for the community ",1

Yes, it can be very frustrating at times due to how the community can be, but that is with any competetive game.  Even though it is a bit dated now, the graphics still are great in my opinion and the game can run on pretty much any basic game machine.  Learning the different gods truly can be a craft and that alone is an addiction in itself.  I highly recommend Smite compared to the other MOBA's simply because of the 3rd person view.  You really take control of your toon much more so than any other MOBA.",1

12325,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Pros: If you are looking for a game that succeeds Ragnarok Online, this game in many ways accomplishes it. It's got a awesome art style, works great with a controller. There's a lot of ease of access. Rarely do you need to consult a FAQ.Cons: Bots on the field, bots in town spamming. But can you talk in chat? Nope, gotta pay. So normally some players are spending $5 a month to endlessly annoy you. This results in ZERO community. Do a set number of quests per zone, fight a few boss monsters, rinse, repeat. Oh boy rinse repeat. This wouldn't be as bad if not for the required money grinding. You need a lot of silver to travel, repair armor; that breaks quickly, upgrading weapons, spells, even accessing your bank. I also don't recommend paying for this, as you are still limited. It's like they took this beatiful game and said, ""We want money, but we don't want to put any effort past 40% game developement.""Avoid it. The game is definitely got great gameplay for an MMO. But for how little it offers, for how they copy and paste each zone. It feels like they made 2 areas, then just recycled them over and over. It's astonishing how little support the game has, how little moderation against bots, and it's total lack of a community. This is a solo MMO. I instead recommend Tera, Diablo 3, or Dark Souls 1-3.

8114,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Something about this game just feels.. lacking. It's not bad per se, but this is probably the fastest I got burned out from playing an MMO. What.. around 1 week?It's marketed as a spiritual successor to Ragnarok Online, but I really don't feel the resemblance besides being 2.5D and having somewhat similar art.From a technical standpoint, the game is somewhat poorly optimized and starts lagging considerably at around 10+ players on-screen, dropping to a janky 40 fps for a medium setup like mine. For reference, I can run something like The Witcher 3 on max settings at around the same framerate. For a 2.5D game, this is very concerning.Gameplay-wise, I don't think it even captures the charm that RO had in its time. The overworld there was huge and exploration was fun... plenty of towns and dungeons to explore in no particular order. Here you've got like 2 towns and levelling is as linear as it gets. Go to this map.. level up a bit and do some quests.. now go to this conveniently adjacent map.. level up some more.. rinse and repeat. As for the quests, whereas RO's quests were hidden and scattered like easter eggs with interesting rewards, the quests here are a dime a dozen and either just kill, fetch, or click quests for some amount of XP and disposable gear.I won't even get into the player trading, auction house, and botting.. a lot of people already have those covered. Who knows.. maybe it all gets better in the late game. Regardless, the journey to get there sure is boring as hell though.",0

The free to play model is a bit frustrating at times, mostly just on inventory space, but once you start playing you realize that points to unlock these features gradually show up as you are questing and doing your regular stuff anyway. There's a lot of content and yes you do have to pay for each expansion but if the game is pretty playable without a monthly sub how can you really complain? Combat is faster than I remember but slower than other MMOs. If you want a bit of a flash back in game play style but not have the awkward clunkiness of everquest this is for you. The visuals have aged well too and there are still times you can stop and admire the art and scenery. Give it a shot, get to level 20 on one character and see if you like it.

And you cannot have the Dark Brotherhood card unless you pay. -For me it's always a tough choice:if I should spend 100 coin for one core pack which exculed all brotherhood content since I am so cheap or gamble my luck for 150 for an arena match-I felt this game is designed to get you hook and make you spend more money.-Also. if you gotta make careful decision to spend your soul gem to craft cards or it's going to take some time to get you going with that one legendary card that you want lol.-The 2 lanes battles and rune system is very interesting, it prevents ""rush decks"" like in Heartstone.

Smite has always felt like the easier MOBA to play if you were bad at something like LoL, I used to hate MOBAs with a passion but Smite helped me get into the genre so I'm thankful. I guess the best way to explain it would be, if you hate MOBAs but really want to give them a chance, Smite is probably a good place to start. Personally, I'm done with this game, it feels like they're trying to hard to please their audience with cringey anime themes, and that's coming from a weeb.

15531,Magic Duels,2017.0,"Situational play, and am only recommending this game for those of you who have friends to play with.Magic Duels is a hell of a lot better than the Magic 12-15 series for Pc. But those games were absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ so that shouldn't have been too hard to do. Magic Duels has some major issues, like making set expansions Insanely over powered, causing the previous sets to be almost worthless in order to score A quick CASH GRAB from their player base.So why the positive review? Because it is fairly well done, and I can see A real effort was made here, unlike the previous titles. Pros:Very smooth interface (finally) .Very fun to play with friends.2 headed giant mode.Games are easy to get in, and out of.Rarely had disconnects... Could have been because I only play with friends though; and they all have High speed internet.Card search tools are getting better.You can create decks.Pretty sure it has over 1,200 cards at this point.Can help train your mind for tournement play when it comes to simple strats.Its relaxing to to mess around with new deck ideas. Pretty limited though.Cons:Though it has gotten better, creating decks is A NIGHTMARE, and the layout for doing so is trash. Why the hell does Wizard have so much trouble imitating real life? It is almost as if they have never created A TCG deck!Pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥selection of cards.Not enough variety in play styles.Not enough card variation for its current play styles (I find that even the cool combo ideas are lacking).AI takes A ♥♥♥♥ing ETERNITY to decide what to do on its turn in 2HG mode. Pretty bad in Single player also.Your deck better be bad♥♥♥♥♥if you expect to get any real gold grinding done to unlock cards.You are pretty limited strategically.Super fast paced decks always win.Random generator is flawed in A MASSIVE way when it comes drawing cards. You will get♥♥♥♥♥♥hands FAR more often, than not. For instance you could get nothing but Mana on your draw, then get nothing but mana again on mulligan, and A ♥♥♥♥ing gain. So I'm gonna point this out since apparently Wizard has never played their damn TCG. When players draw A hand of nothing but Mana (all players do this btw, even in competition) they make a mental note, subconsciously even, and they do their best when shuffling to separate that Mana. They also have full control over how many times they shuffle, giving them BETTER odds of not CONTINUOUSLY getting♥♥♥♥♥♥cards game after GAME! If it is not the random generator than Wiz is deliberately cheating players, in hopes they will buy better cards.AI decks are built in such a way that even just trying to test out new deck ideas becomes an insane hassle. Which kills a lot of the fun.It took me over 200 hours to unlock a set not spending money. Yeah... I know.PVP games, lol, don't even get me started. Obviously players purchasing mass packs have A HUGE advantage.If anything else comes to mind ill slap it in.I also want to add, again, if you do not have peeps to play with I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. It is a sink hole, and is designed as such. Without friends, deck testing, as well as everything else, just becomes A massive pain in your♥♥♥♥♥ We play games to relax and have fun, Not add to the huge amount of stress most of us are under daily.

Not to talk about the fact that most of the players will randomly write something in russian every 5 seconds ))))- Bombers -> As a US Bombers main, I realized that bombers go down very quickly, expecially B-17s and that's a shame, because it's very hard to shoot down most of the other bombers, but the B-17 is probably one of the weakest. And it's kinda strange, since in real life, the B-17 was one of the best bombers.- Russia -> Every russian plane\tank is overpowered, I litterally got bored of playing as US and constatly get shot down by Russia that I tried to play Russia and got bored of shooting down other planes.-Every tank that's not russian seems to have armor made of cardboard, you can literally shoot at least 10 times at a russian tank and you won't do anything to it, then you get destroyed by like 5 machine gun rounds from a russian tank.The usual joke about this game is that it is russian biased, well guess what?

14338,War Thunder,2018.0,"I used to enjoy the game itself, but the last time I had played it, it now installs a service agent that I did not consent to the installing of. This agent remains running on your PC, does not get removed when uninstalling the game, and requires a meticulous process of tracking down all files related to it and removing them, including purging the registry of all keys pointing to it or created by it. This agent is a potential backdoor for attackers and therefore a security risk, even more so since it acts as a ""torrent seeder"" for others downloading updates to the game (according to this review: https://steamcommunity.com/id/Grimlakin/recommended/236390/ )I'm in the IT area and I don't like the idea of an agent running on my computer from a third party I don't trust, especially if it actually is ""seeding"" since it will put constant traffic on certain ports, acting as a backdoor for someone nasty. I have since uninstalled the game, and the agent, and I recommend that if you care about the security of your PC, that you do the same or find a way to disable the agent permanently.

7592,World of Warships,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewBefore you invest any money in the game, you should know that it has been out several years and the game balance is still a complete joke with absolutely horrid matchmaking. Ships from 20 years apart are forced to fight each other with enormous imbalances and a tier 5 will face tier 7s every other match.High tier gameplay is mostly boring campfests at long range because moving close gets someone instantly focused on the wide open maps.Aircraft carriers are both boring to play (like the world's worst RTS game) but also game-breakingly overpowered, with infinite fuel planes that launch 30 in 10 seconds (unlike a real carrier where it would take hours to get every single plane out of the hangar, moved up on deck and launched one at a time.) Because of the joke matchmaking, an aircraft carrier can fight a 1910 ship that does 0 DPS to airplanes because it got time-traveled by the terrible russian developer. Airplanes can drop torpedoes from solid cliff faces or 1 inch of water and there are no water-tight compartments on ships in-game, so a ship that could float without the nose and without the rear in real life will auto-die to 1 tiny section flooding with water after extinguishing a fire. Carriers average the damage of 3-4 combat ships but can stay hidden in spawn behind a cliff all game long with no risk.It's okay to play free, but do not expect the company to improve the game. They haven't made CVs either realistic or balanced in several years of being out.",0

19,Trove,2015.0,"This is honestly a very good and addicting game, its fun and enjoyable. But there is some down sides sadly...-------------------------Pros:- Its not a minecraft clone, far from it.- The amount of weapons in the game is really nice :)- There is no ""p2w"" Sure there are opitions of spending real world money but you don't need to.Cons:- They need more servers, the 1000+ Queues are insane.- They need more actions i guess? Instead of just three main attacks.",1

19460,AdventureQuest 3D,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewLong-time AQWorlds veteran here, been playing since 2010.This game is pretty good so far, it still feels like the classic AQWorlds.Keep up the good work Aritx Entertainment!",1
8557,Dreadnought,2018.0,"I've been playing this in Beta for about a year now. I'm giving this game a thumbs up because I've experienced it in a better state than it is in Steam at the moment and I believe the devs, if given a chance, can get it back to that state. Let me elaborate with areas needing improvement and some serious positives about this game. Areas Needing Improvement:- Menu (non-gameplay) UI: Went from passable in Beta to absolutely atrocious with the Steam release; This needs to be addressed ASAP by devs as it is hindering many new players from falling in love with the game- Sounds design: I really don't know why they had to touch the audio as it was fine as it was in Beta. Audio ques in this Steam release has been degraded. On a positive note, the devs know this and are working hard to fix it (I hope... soon...)- In game social: The player communications interface is glitchy and often down-right broken. This was an issue in Beta and remains an issue now. - Devs and Feedback: This might be the biggest issue. The team at SixFoot seems to have problems incorporating PLAYER feedback into their releases and patches. There is a lively and respectful player community that has offered many suggestions for improving the game only to be let down when SixFoot goes the complete opposite direction. This is a matter of changing the culture there... so management, take heed if you want to save yourself from the brink. Positives: - Core gameplay and balance is well done- Each ship class requires it's own tactics and team play strategy is key- Customization through modules and officer briefings add additional depth to what initially seems like a simple game mechanic- Player-base since Steam release has improved thus more matches and shorter waiting times- Graphics (gameplay) are pretty good with little details ",1
15245,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,"I have been playing this game since 2012.I have, on two accounts, sunk around 1700 hours.This used to be an amazing game, and at times, it stil can be. But so far it is mired in so so many issues that Valve simply refuses to fix. Solutions that are relativley simple to introduce but never are, and the end result is an absolutely horrendous gaming experience.They added a leveling system for no purpose other than cosmetic. The servers are either barely populated, or populated by new players being destroyed by more experienced players, because matchmaking just haphazardly shoves in people of all skill levels. There's no system in place to pit people of an equal or similar skill level in the same server, to make for a balanced, fun and fair experience. Which you'd think they'd've thought to implement, but, nah, the Level system is just there for show. It makes for an extremely unsatisfying gaming experience. I cannot count how many times i've been on a team made up of new players, most of them Snipers and Spies, fighting against a team that just curbstoms them before they even know what's going on. This is not good, it's frustrating and it's killing the gaming experience for everyone.New players don't get better and simply get frustrated that they're being shitwhipped and stomped left and right by stronger players. Veteran players stuck on underpowered teams get frustrated at the lack of quality control on servers. And some veteran players, find the idea of just wrecking house in a minute and leaving to be a very underwhelming and boring gaming experience. And no, it being 'casual' does not excuse this. The majority of people play TF2 on casual and we deserve more quality control to make sure our gaming experiences are worth having.The servers are constantly full of Snipers and Spies because the game has no universial class limit.The game is also extremely unwelcoming to new players. The training system failsto cover most of the nuances of the game. It has an absurdly high learning curve. Unless you know it like the back of your hand before going in (as i did), you're going to have a hard time.And the hackers....In the past two weeks, i've encountered about, five hackers. Four times, i was kicked off of the server for reporting the hacker and trying to get my team to kick them. I don't know how, but there seriously need to be better ways to combat hackers on the servers. Because this is unacceptable.This game is at this point, a rotting, shambling corpse. Fun at times, yeah, but severely frustrating, in a way it has no right to be, given how easy the solutions to it's myriad of issues would be. My gaming experiences recently have been nothing short of frustrating. It's making ME frustrated and i start acting like an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and at that point, i think it's just not worth it. And at the same time i want to enjoy this game because i love it. I've loved this game even before i played it. I was in love with it's comedy, it's world. I read the Wiki, devouring everything i could until the day i could play it. I've been playing it since 2012. I don't want to give up on it, but i have for a period and only recently decided to come back to it.But honestly, i can't reccomend it at this point.",0
1734,Black Squad,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewDespite a few setbacks here and there, overall Neowiz has come together to create what could possibly be one of the better free to play games of the later 2010's. They did it once with Alliance of Valiant Arms, and are doing it again with Black Squad. The gameplay is refined, the controls are snappy, and the deaths are quick. The gameplay in my eyes is extremely fun and rewarding. A bit repetitive at times, but the overall design of the game outweighs this.",1
17495,Creativerse,2015.0,"Early Access Review     I went into this not sure if I was going to like the game, but willing to give it a little bit of time to see for myself.  After the first few hours of playtime, I realised that I was hooked.  My family and I have always loved playing minecraft together and this is everything we loved about that game and then some.  We can create, we can fight, we can BLOW THINGS UP!  It allows each of us to play in our own style.  The amazing part is that this is still being tweaked and improved upon to add even more incredible things.  There are only two things that I can see on the negative side so far and those are:         1. There is no offline gameplay         2.  Characters are not modable (but you do get  a choice between being a boy or a girl)     The fact that these are the only things that I and my family can find that are negative, says a lot.  In the future, these things could also change.  We will be playing this game for a long time to come so hopefully we will see it come about.  I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone!",1
1929,DCS World Steam Edition,2016.0,"First of all, I would like to say this is not a game, it`s a simulator, don`t have time or patience? Dont download this, and complain about how sh*t it is on steam reviews. The ""DLC"" are high fidelity representations of an aircraft, in my experience, all the ones I bought, (huey, a10c, BS2, gazelle) are amazing and 100% worth the money. Multiplayer is where Dcs really shines, OP BLUEFLAG being a very good example. All in all, I would recomend this to anyone interested in flight simming, but a HOTAS and a trackIR are basic necessities.",1
194,PlanetSide 2,2015.0,"Okay, after playing the game for an hour, I wrote a sensible review of the game, stating I would not recommend it. The followling is myy reveiw after 5 whole hours of existing as a miserable soldier in this war.I likened it being repeatedly kicked in the nuts and then coaxed into giving it another go. The first reveiw was more detailed than that, but that's the gist. I pointed out some sound flaws, and held up the graphics and stability of the engine and server. I basically said it was not my cup of tea. 6 out of 8 people found my review helpful, either saying “Hey, I love games that repeatedly kick me in the balls!” and others who say “Oh, That sounds like a waste of my time and energy.” Either way- helpful.The 2 people who did not find my review helpful took it upon themselves to say I was being to harsh, and also said I “Couldn’t review the game after only 1 hour.” I did. He was clearly in denial! But I downloaded the game AGAIN, just to be sure.After 5 hours, I can say, I would not recommend this game to a friend. I just don’t think its fun! How’s that! Vehicles- they are okay. The controls are messed up on the aircraft though. WAY off weirder than anything I’ve ever played were you fly a plane. But hey, I’ve never piloted an aircraft, what do I know? I know this wasn’t fun.Character models- They are okay. You can customize them with certificates (or something) you earn or money you pay. Pretty cool. Also hard to tell people apart in various kinds of light. It’s not so clear cut as red dudes shooting blue dudes, when only small elements on a person’s suit are colored so, and the lighting is a hazy beautiful sunset PURPLE. The high tech futuristic  HUD doesn’t know if a guy is friend or foe until its too late. Maybe you can buy an upgrade for that . . . I don’t care. Controls- they are okay. They are what I would expect. I like 3rd person with cover mechanics better, personally. I say 1st Person Shooter and honestly, you know most of the controls. Nothing special, It gets it done.Landscape- You are on a planet with some continents divided up into a bunch of hexagons. There isn’t much in the way or realistic geological terrain, overall (like you see in Arma and DayZ- beautiful and realistic). It is more of that sculpty lumpy mountain looking stuff, and here are some really big rocks, trees, a swamp, like that. Some places are better than others. It’s not bad, it’s just nothing special. There is a base every 100 meters or so, no infrastructure, no towns, no cities, no villages, no civilians, no factories, no mines, no wildlife, no nothing. This is a planet full of military bases and there are three factions of really stupid people fighting over it FOR WHAT!?!?   Honestly, I don’t care. I didn’t see anything worth fighting for. That brings us to . . . .Story- The planet should be a desolate wasteland of craters and corpses. Or maybe one of the factions would have just nuked the whole place from orbit? Basically these three armies are fighting each other with guns and vehicles when they have these machines that just SPEW soldiers into the fight. Put them in vehicles or squads, or drop them unrealistically from low orbit. They run about and die, only to be spewed back out of the machines and given weapons and pointed in the direction of “enemy” like suicidal lemmings!  Why? There are evil republicans, of course, high tech homosexuals, why not, and super awesome rebellious Rock-and-Roll rebels! I don't know what they are fighting for.The Action- The most fun I had was repairing stuff. I followed some tanks around and repaired them, used their guns until they needed repairs, repaired them. Me and a billion others took a giant mushroom place. Cool. I repaired some guns and shot at tanks and repaired some AA guns and shot at aircraft. Cool. I climbed a mountain and got shot in the face. Disappointing. Most of it is spawn, turn a corner die, spawn run a half mile, die, spawn, grenade, die, spawn, fall, die, spawn, try to repair some shield generator, get shot in the face, die. Wrap up- This is the longest review I have written. I honestly, just don’t really like wild disorganized hari-kari PVP. This is not a team assaulting a fortified position . . . It is three armies ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at each other as hard as they can, and whoever is standing on the pile at the end . . . wins?After 30 minutes, I knew it wasn’t my thing. After 5 hours, I feel cheated. I can’t get that time back and I gained nothing as a human. I already know we are insignificant and conflict is ultimately pointless. This game offers me nothing I can’t have somewhere else and have more fun. Does that mean you will not like it? By all means, use that free will, you may love it. I have met plenty of people into S&M. Would I recommend it to a friend? I did, because misery loves company, but I regret it. It was wrong of me in my subjective view of morality as it stands now. I hope he will forgive me one day. NO, I will not recommend this game to a friend. If they ask, I’ll just say “Nah, that’s not my cup of tea.”Is there anything they could do to change it and make it more palatable to me? No, and I don’t think they should. The game has an audience that loves it. Let it be.Uninstalls like a champ, even the second time around. ",0
17712,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018.0,"First of all, I have a large body of hours on this game. I've seen multiple game breaking updates, e.g. initial implementation of the CZ-75, Revolver, (at the time) massive change to game sounds, slowing down awp scope speed, super fast crouching scout running and many more. However, a lot of issues exist, which valve refuse to acknowledge as issues, e.g. no perfect first bullet accuracy (hearthstone RNG), one way smokes, the terrible UI when watching demos, how every update ensures my 1080ti and i7-7700k can barely run CS:GO at 250fps, the volume of hackers on the game, peekers advantage, hit reg, inconsistencies in the game's playability between resolutions, re-doing maps and not testing how well they run, making people with lower end rigs drop below 50fps, molotov's random spreading, pistol damage and mobility, and gosh I could go on forever.But to be fair there has been multiple positive updates: Getting rid of the fire car on dust 2 long. That's all I can think about at this moment. But I'm sure there's more.However, I have to play this game:1. because I have skins that are worth more than my petty existance, 2. There's something addicting about being british and joining a game and speaking with an accent,3. On the occasional games that teams are balanced and there's no cheaters, they have been known to be fun (I swear),4. Every other shooter is just boring cos of the huge player base on counter-strike,5. I have invested so many hours in this game, I just don't know what to do anymore.",0

Look at guides online, it's completely fine too, see what you can do to tweek it, your first build will always be horrible if you do not get help, but when you do make that one magical build that destroys everything it's extremely rewarding.The Currency in this game is what made me play it for so long, it's so complex but at the same time simple.

2483,Brawlhalla,2017.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewHuh where i even start...The Game it self it's just another 2D party fighting game based on multiple gamemodes. once you start the game for the first time. you probably are gonna play free for all since it's the most gamemode played when you start playing it. you have 33 characters to use and more coming up, but there's only 6 characters to use for free per week you can also unlock characters with the currency of the game, each one with 2 types of weapons including the unarmed fists. the game it self it can be seen as a competitive game or a fun party game depends on the case your working.Once i got 100 hours on the game i started playing the gamemode ranked. where i started learning a lot of the game and also some cool  tricks to use like the ""gravity cancel"", once i knew some combos with my main character (Asuri) i started taking the game as something more serious since i never had a game that keep me playing it for that time. I started playing the game since it was around 4 weeks old. so i grew up with the game, i never wanted to search for combo videos since i wanted to learn how to play it by myself. so after 500 hours i had atleast 24 characters unlocked i was rank gold with only one skin buyed. since it was thoose days where i started using other characters instead of my main character. now that i passed the 700 hours i can already tell that i spend a lot of time of this game. around 4 hours per day. this game make me find new people who are now my friends. but as always nothing it's perfect. This the moment when i stop talking about  the pros and start moving to the issues i have with game. The Game itself it can be seen as a competitive game, but that doesn't mean your not gonna find people who probably be there just trying to be a jerk with everyone they found on the game. the game it'self has some players that take the game to seriously so they probably will try to win no matter what instead of having fun as the game it's supposed to be. so don't feel angry if you fight someone and after the match he left without saying gg or letting some insults in the chat, and also when they won they will probably will say ""ez"" instead of gg. to make the things more easier to explain, YOU WILL FIND A LOT OF SALT ON THIS GAME.At the topic of microtransactions. this game like almost every F2P game, have microtransactions, but that doesn't mean this is a pay to win game. since that the only thing you can buy it's character skins, K. O. effects, sidekicks, and avatars. so the microtransactions doesn't affect the gameplay itself. If i was a videogame reviewer, i will probably  say that this game itself it can be funny to play but only with friends. but since i have 900+ hours on the game, the only thing i can say it's...and it's pretty amazingIt's a pretty fun game.-RayzoomFox",1

What it does do is provide a really fun causual and social MMO that is truly cross platform and has a logical gear progression / crafting system directly tied to ""raiding"". End game raiding in AQ3D is as casual as you would want it to be on an MMO that is largely played on phones and tablets. You click an NPC and are instantly grouped and teleporterd to the ongoing raids.

You can pay to get good gear from the jump, and that may be the best choice for those that don't enjoy the grind and time put into slowly leveling up from the beginning and learning some easy and hard lessons along the way. I enjoy fishing in real life and I can get a similar level of enjoyment from playing this game. If you don't have the patience to spend hours and hours working your way up through the rank levels and limiting your travel, you may find this title very frustrating. For new players, please seek out the guidance of other players from using online videos or asking more experienced players in your map event using the in-game chat. Most folks are helpful and willing to guide you. If you run into somebody who is not, jump into a new map room and try again. I stream FP gameplay on YouTube and Twitch and have several folks come through in the chat and help me out. As more experienced players lend a hand to helping out newer players, the community benefits as whole and the gameplay becomes more rewarding as a result. Let the developers do their job, folks, as they have enough on their hands and everybody complaining about DLC prices will not have a permanent impact on their approach to the gameplay and related mechanics in the future. If you have a technical issue, contact them respectfully and seek out guidance, but don't berate them and expect the in-game currency system to change overnight. THAT BEING SAID, I would absolutely love for a system to be implemented for players to be able to setup their own ""events""-style tournaments to invite friends or random other players. Set the location, the parameters for scoring, and the time limit, etc. Maybe even drop the travel/license costs but balance it by not allowing the catches made during the custom events to impact player EXP level or credit earnings.

1197,H1Z1,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe amount of hate for this game is astronomical, yet warrented.I have a ""clan"" of about 5-10 guys mostly based in the east coast of the U.S, for the longest time, we would only play two games, CS GO and Civ 5.  As you can imagine, it eventually got stale and was slowly toxifying our relationship due to the nature of CS GO and Civ 5.  I should mention that we are a mostly competitive group, so getting dicked on in Civ or berating each other in CS GO was getting old after 1-2 years.Eventually, two of the people in our group decided to pick up the game, much to my disgust.  I remember when it was supposed to be free, then it became $20, then they split it up into TWO games for $20 each which left me appalled.  I also had a VERY sour taste in my mouth for early access after Cubeworld, DayZ Standalone, and about every other Early Access game that had come out.  Yet my two friends raved and raved about how much fun they were having, to which I would respond ""50% rating on steam"".  Well, after deranking from LEM in CS GO, I decided that I was done with that game for a while, and I needed something else to take my attention.  I ended up playing a lot of The Division, which was another game chock full of broken promises, but I enjoyed it a lot.  So I eventually got tired of The Division and caved in and bought the game, and man oh man was I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when I first launched it.  I crashed out of my first 3 games.  Which is ridiculous considering I have an i5 4440 and a GTX 970.  After 3 hours of troubleshooting I launched it up and went into my first solo game.  I got 9th place, and was hooked.If any of you have ever played minecraft hunger games or even vanilla rust, you know the feeling of adrenaline when you get into an intense fight.  This game delivers, and rewards you time and time again for your aim *not the shitgun though*.  My friends and I were laughing at the bugs *cars doing gymnastic flips* and working together as a team in Fives.  Losing does not feel that bad in this game as you can instantly load into another one without having to worry about any ""rank  loss"" *cough* CS GO *cough*.  All in all, this game is a bug riddled mess with greedy♥♥♥♥♥developers, but if your looking for a game to just load up and play with friends, then I think this is the game for you.",1
5174,War Thunder,2016.0,"Before I start, I just want to say I have WAY more than just 400 hours played in this game. I originially didn't link it to my steam account.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great game, I love flying around, dogfighting and ground pounding but there's just so much wrong with it right now. Namely, the battle rating system and Gaijins reliance on ""their data"" for it's balancing (the battle rating system (or BR system) is basically the match maker for those new to the game).First off, I'll start with my largest gripe, the BR system. This just doesn't work well enough for it to be in game, simply because the devs only adjust the BRs of planes/tanks off of player data, which is a huge problem. This makes tier 5 (highest tier in game) near unplayable. For example, the Me-262 C variants, 1945 jets with rocket boosters on them, fight F-86 F-2s and Hawker Hunters, Korean/1953 era jets. While the Me-262 Cs are good enough planes in game, they just can't catch up with, nor dogfight top tier jets (they struggle to take off their engines are that bad). Yet Gaijins ""data"" says they do ""perfectly fine"" where they are. That's only because in these battles, there are similar jets thrown into the slaughter they can actually kill outside of head ons. Vampires, Meteors (all of them), F-80s, MiG-9s, F9Fs. None of those should be in the place they are.I could rant for hours on this and all the individual adjustments they should make (lower tier planes have this issue as well to a lesser extent) but there's really no point. Gaijin refuses to listen to the community about this and just constantly refer to this invisible ""data"" when they make decisions like that. It's compressed tier 5 into oblivion, and as such, people leave out of frustration. Then it gets further compressed to increase queue times, loop, loop, etc. Eventually, if this keeps up, the game will die.As for tanks, it just feels endlessly frustrating to play. Get one shot, forced to leave the match. Get shot from somewhere you couldnt see from because someone turned their graphics to the lowest settings to see you while you want to enjoy the grass/trees/smoke/etc and be immersed. Tanks are also subject to compression as well, but since I never played them much, I don't know much about that situation.How about game modes? Well, you have arcade (AB), realistic (RB) and simulator modes (SB). AB is simple, just chaos, respawns and lots of angry children. RB is more strategic, one life and the planes/tanks behave in a more realistic fashion. It's safe to say that RB is the middle ground of this game, the one I've played most and probably the mode that suffers most from the BR compression. SB is total trash compered to other simulator games like IL-2 bos or DCS world. Oddly enough though, SB tanks is good and probably what RB should be for tanks right now imo.Oh, and to finish it off, Bombers/attack aircraft are mostly useless. Bombers/attackers don't contribute to a victory outside of tier 4 (and or spam) and are just exp pinatas. In tank battles though, they're just an annoyance, since SPAA can easily one shot them. Oh and SPAA are pretty damn good at killing tanks. WAY too good in fact. One tier 1 SPAA in fact can drive 80kph and seal clubs everything it faces.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tl;dr: The mechanics/controls are fun and smooth. But the game right now suffers from balancing issues, a company that totally ignores community feed back outside of ""Gimmie dis plane/tank, I'll buy it!"" and in general, frustrating gameplay as a result. It has a lot of potential and could really go somewhere, but only if the devs stop and listen to the people that've spent thousands of hours of gameplay on this game.",0

You buy the gun that one shots you with the in game credits but it takes 3+ shots to kill anyone because you didn't spend real money on all the upgrades. Good luck even geting out of the base unless you pay real money to buy ranged anti tank weapons. You can earn them sure, but you have to kill tanks to earn them and tankers know where the anti tank weapons are on the map and will just camp them so you can't use them.

The english and korean voices are there, but not the japanese voices for some reason.",1
1245,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewNOTE: This is a review on the STEAM version of the game and how I feel the game from a PC perspective and not a mobile perspective. There is no difference from the steam version and the mobile version but there are some things that look good on a phone or tablet but not so much on the PC. If this was a review on the mobile version then I would definitetly recommend this game.Now as the game is still open beta, there are many things to be added and polished on (like levels, maps, shops etc) so I can't talk about the lack of content but instead I will mention the things that I feel are weird in the PC or things that should be added or modified.The UI - It shouldn't come to a suprise that when you make a cross platform game between PC and mobile, there are gonna have to be corners cut. In this case its the UI. On mobile, the UI looks great and makes sense but on the PC, it just looks cheap and unclean. Preferably if possible, adding an option to switch between tablet UI and PC UI would be amazing. The UI also lacks alot of small yet needed details like specific HP, MP, and XP numbers.Friends/Party System - While there is an friends list system, there is no party system. You can use the summon code (which is a bit buggy at times. I was stuck in loading) to play on the same channel/map but there isn't a real party system. so you can't see their HP/MP bar without clicking on them. This may not be as big as a problem now but in the future when there are healer classes, it would be extremely difficult to play as you can't attack a monster while keeping tabs on your friends HP at the same time.Weapons/Classes/Stats - There are 4 main stats in the game; HP, MP, Attack, and Defense. The class you have on only affect your skills and nothing else. ""Daggers"" gives the most Attack of all the weapons, ""staffs"" give the most MP, and ""swords"" give the most Defense. Here's the problem. All the classes are equally tanky. I have played all the classes besides Guardian and I have noticed little to no difference in survivability. Being tanky isn't going to help when you're playing a Rogue or Mage because that's not what they do, and Warriors are suppose to be tanky, but do a bad job at it because there are no skills to help him be tanky. In fact, I would say Mage and Rogue are more tanky because they have defensive skills (Mana Sheild and Stealth). This makes Attack the most valuable stat for doing the most damage. AQW was really customizable because there was no restriction on what weapon you could use. You could be a Mage and use a hammer, but this only worked because every weapons attack stats were the same and the attack stats are mainly determined by the enchant. In AQ3D, each weapon has different stats. Attack determines how much damage you do, and that's the only real stat you should be going for as Rogue or Mage. Even Warriors should build this over Defense tbh. ""Daggers"" have the highest attack making the ""daggers"" the only viable weapon to use for high DPS. This takes away a lot of customization (plus it looks weird for a mage to use a dagger as a weapon). Some solutions to this would be adding more stats (like LUK for Rogues and INT for mages) or making it like AQW where all weapons have equal damage and the stat's are based off enchants.Again, this game is still in beta so it is expected to be some flaws but there is a lot of potential in this game. With some things added and polished, I can see this being a very fun game ",0
998,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIm not so much into card games, but I got this for free and tried it. I can't say that it's not good.

19844,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Fractured Space seems to consistently be referred to as a MOBA, and while it technically is it's sort of a stretch. Two teams face off trying to capture the other's base. That's about it (so far), and is the essence of its MOBA classification. That makes it a bit boring, especially if the team you end on doesn't adjust their ships to complement the others'. That's really the only negative I can see with Fractured Space, which is a rather big deal since it's pretty much the game mode you're going to play.The other extras add up to make it a solid f2p game, though. At $39.99 to unlock all 31 ships isn't outrageous (and they go on sale for $19.99 from time to time). The graphics are excellent, and the added battle chatter from your crew adds to the immersion - although I know, ""Millions of lives were lost...to your incompetence"" everytime I die.I recommend Fractured Space since it's free to play and you have nothing to lose.",1
19749,Minion Masters,2018.0,Early Access ReviewGame was fun for the first couple hours and then suddenly it felt like I was consistently getting cheated. I summon a level 9 monster and it gets one shot from a crawling zombie and then they summon a level 3 that tanks hits like no tomorrow for no reason what so ever. Then I incorperate the same cards into my deck and they don't do the same things. Game doesn't explain why things happen the way they do and if there is special reasons why it happens it should be at least explained so the player has a general idea. I'm almost level 30 and still feel like it's 100% RNG. It literally just gives you false hope in the beginning when the game makes sense and then just says screw you and kicks you in the nuts a little ways down the road. I also consistently go against people who are some how able to summon Cleavers what seems like back to back even after I put down numerous disrupters. And no this isn't the mirage ability where it blows up into balloons. I don't know if there's a cheat going around or some kind of exploit but it's impossible to win when someone is capable of limitlessly playing high mana costing cards. Not to mention the archer masters are way over powered. The ability to shoot all the way across the arena is ridiculous. What's worse is they take out your puffs before you even have a chance to do anything. Uninstallin this garbage. Sad cause I liked the game too.,0

12233,Magic Duels,2015.0,"Magic duels is a really good card game because it is based on the paper sets which is designed with amazing care and has been improved over the years. It has a decent portion of the paper cards, but only of the newest sets of 2015.The magic rules are well implemented, I did not witness many gameplay bugs.The game is free to play. You begin with tutorials quests for each color, doing a bit of storytelling and explaining how the game works, and giving you the currency of the game as a reward.You are also given the standard starters decks of each color and you can build your deck entirely as you desire between 60 and 100 cards. It has additionnal limitations from the paper game on deckbuilding, the limit of 4 times the same card has been deviated to further reduces the amount of copies of rare cards you are allowed to put in the deck. For example you will be limited to 2 copies of legendary creatures.Winning matches in versus will earn you the game currency against Ai (5-15g) or human (20g) with a limit of 200g per day. Then you can buy boosters for 150g. Boosters will not give you duplicates of a card once you have reached the maximum amount of copies you can fit in a deck. There is no trading cards available. So you will be able to get 6 new cards every day for free as long as you can build a decent deck. You can check magic forums like nogoblinsallowed to get ideas if you are new to this. You will be able to build some solid decks with the basic offered cards.You can also buy the game currency with real money to unlock a lot of boosters immediately.gameplay problematic:The starter decks are extremely limited, you will lose a lot of matchups against human oponents that have farmed the game from the start or that have purchased the booster, wich means that you will need to grind a lot of matches to be able to get to your 150g daily gold to buy a booster, which gets quickly dull. For example the toughest green creature is a vanilla 6/7 for 7 lands, which sucks for a green creature, and especially when a wealthy player will face you with a 6/6, renown 6, for 5 lands, nuke your board with chandra's ignition, and can drop gaia's revenge a bit further down the road.You better play agressive or midrange, because ramp is much better with booster cards.Now the painful part:Magic games have been around for a while, and the matchmaking is still painfull to go through, it is long and buggy. In 2v2 mode you need to reset the match  2/3 because one player was not connected properly and was replaced by AI. That is especially bad compared to the newcommer of the genre Heartstone. And that hurts a lot more when you know that your deck could be much better and you are not that confident in the actual fight that will happen.The passing of turns and interupt mecanisms forced in the game add a lot of downtime compared to paper magic.Don't get me wrong, the game is a lot of fun, you can use it to learn how to play magic and get a good idea how to build decks, staregy and tactics, for free. And you can also play it anytime, anywhere as long as you are connected.But I'd rather recommend playing paper magic with your local community if you live in a city, or buy the boosters ASAP to get you to the fun decks adn spare you the painful grind.  So actually the game is more around 32â‚¬ if you want to enjoy it.  ",0

First off in general i felt it  was too fast, from combat itself to the speed and destruction of the larger capital ships. And second the larger capital ship seemed really undergunned for such a large ship. Frigates, corvettes, and destroyer style ships should be quick and manueverable with limited options for weapons sacrificing heavy weapons and armor for manueverability and speed. Where as the larger cruiser, battleship, and carrier options should be much harder to kill and have an assortment of heavy weaponry at the severe cost to speed and manueverability.

438,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"This is most likely going to be one of the most negative recommendations you will ever read, but I tend to criticize heavily the things I enjoy and despite my criticisms I do enjoy Planetside 2, as you may have guess with the amount of hours logged. But this game has serious issues bugging it and they will ensure the demise of this game sooner before later, as a shooter it is fun but as an MMO it will not be able to sustain itself much longer.  And it’s up to you to determine if putting up with these issues is worth the rush of being in massive scale battles that no other game is capable of.   The first issue I have with the game is when many of the game’s individual elements put together it seems to fall apart.  It’s like each mechanic of gameplay was designed in a different room with no knowledge of what the final product was supposed to even look like.  Either that or the development team was so intent on copying popular shooters that focus on small 4-64 player battles they gave no thought what so ever to how much of an impact it would have with hundreds of players. One example of this is that the developers gave people the ability to plant ammo packs without restraint, giving infinite ammo and unlimited healing (seriously you can revive people in less time than it takes to kill them).  The best strategy for winning an evenly matched fight is to simply bore the enemy until they give up and leave.  With unlimited healing and ammo on both sides many battles result in a standstill with my squad leader saying something along the lines of “let’s go someplace else.”  Another flaw of Planetside 2 is the level design.  The bases look good aesthetically but function poorly.  I think the developers are slowly becoming aware of this is constant changes are being made, however I think if you took the words “Cram as many people as you can into a choke point” and copy pasted it across 10 pages you would have the entire design document.  This choke point obsession combined with the mechanics of infinite healing/ammo creates the ‘bore the enemy into submission’ battles.  You either have the population at the base to steamroll it, or you have the population to get steamrolled.  If you and your enemies have even remotely even forces chances are you just shoot at each other until someone falls asleep at the keyboard. If you are defending a base you can always go after the mobile spawn points, but since those are in infinite supply as well they can always bring more. With lackluster stage design and small scale shooter mechanics pretending they can work in an MMO are evidence of the chief issue of Planetside 2; that many of its ideas just don’t work well together.  As long as it continues to function with these ideas it will be nothing but a source of constant issues.  The other issue I will address is the system of economics. Basic economics tell us that when there is an abundance of something it has no value. It is because of this reason many people consider Planetside 2’s predecessor to be superior.  In the original Planetside not everyone could do everything, therefore what you chose to do had value because not everyone would be capable of it. If you decided to drive a tank, it was meaningful because not everyone could.  As a result tanks were able to shake up the gameplay, add variety to the battlefield and make things interesting.  In Planetside 2 the developers gave everyone the ability to drive a tank and now they are worthless, instagibable by practically anyone (including medics).  It is because everyone has access to everything that the gameplay gets boiled down into a gray homogenous amoeba like mass labeled zerg, anything that is not zerg will be consumed and nerfed down until it is.  This cripples the gameplay significantly.  Any attempt to introduce anything new and interesting will be passed through the consideration that everyone will be doing it and therefore it must be absorbed as part of the zergy mass, and offer no real variety to that mass.  Most recently they introduced a few new weapons for the liberator bomber, and to be honest, they suck.  And they must suck, because if they were actually any good everyone would be using them and nothing else.  Essentially this system only backs the developers into a corner of delivering nothing but piles of mediocrity.   The final issue to bring up is the grind.  If you give an assault rifle to a private 1st class and have him ordered to shoot a hole in the wall, he will shoot a hole in the wall.  If you then give that weapon to a staff sergeant and have him ordered to shoot a hole in the wall, he will shoot a hole in the wall.  The hole will not be any deeper, the weapon will not be more powerful nor will his armor protect him anymore, a magic pixie does not come along and sprinkle its dust on your weapons and armor because you advance in rank.  A good competitive shooter at its core is a game that relies on skill, strategy, tactics and teamwork.  Magic pixie dust to make weapons and armor more powerful in the hands of higher ranked people betrays these very concepts. It has been the chief failing behind many games (APB, Brink, Huxley, and I’m sure you can name a few others). And while Planetside 2 tries to avoid magic pixie dust, it fails.  Many times people had my heavy assault dead to rights with solid out maneuvering, but because I put a lot of magic pixie dust on my shield and armor they stand no chance no matter how skilled or strategic they are, and don’t even get me started on how bad magic pixie dust determines the victor in vehicle combat.  The grind always fails shooters.  Many modern shooters have a grind, and there is a reason they are often referred to as “flavor of the month” shooters. I have no idea why SOE thought that “flavor of the month” shooter mechanics would work in an MMO that needs to be sustainable over years. This is another reason why many people consider the first Planetside superior, because the developers understood this.  A Gauss rifle in the hands of a newbie was the same in the hands of a veteran, no magic pixie dust, just the player’s skill with the weapon.  I believe the proof of this lies in Steam’s wonderful statistics. There is a reason Team Fortress 2, and Counterstrike in its many flavors retain more people over time than Planetside 2 or any of the Call of Duty games, simply because they are not nearly as much the grind fest.  For an MMO to succeed you need to establish long term success, not short term popularity.   As I said before I enjoy Planetside 2, but I don’t see it lasting much longer.  The way much of the gameplay doesn’t seem to go hand in hand, the poor economic decision to give everything to everyone and the constant grinding just to hopefully someday stand on even ground (which most good shooters immediately start you out at) make it wear thin quickly.  It’s like a mosh pit at a speed metal concert.  It’s fun, it’s fast, it’s furious, and can be a blast at times.  But when you’re done there isn’t a real driving incentive to go back to it anytime soon.  If you’re late getting into it you’re going to get your butt kicked to the point you might just leave early, and you know anything new they add is just going to get lost in the moshing.",1
2095,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewHi I really like the game I reach max level 45 now, and I am really enjoying the pvp/crafting part of the game, pve was a lot of fun the main story was addictive I didn't stop until I reach then end.The Debs are making positive changes to the game that I really like. we just got an update that fix the valance and difficulty of the mobs to make it more challenging to reach player cap I am glad I did my main already, Over all with all the haters leaving the game on a hate train taking other players with them I recommend you come back and give it a another try if you are a drama queen and left this game for this and that don't come back I rather have a new wave of new players coming in then salty quitters but everyone has a right to cry and complain I choose to play and enjoy this game for what its and for what it will become.",1
9056,Magic Duels,2016.0,"I'm casul Hearthstone and Paper Magic player so take this review with this in mind.Great tutorials for basic magic rules and special card mechanicsGrowing your card collection feels fair as F2P playerMatchmaking works, I win at average 50% of my gamesNo chat, yeah, ♥♥♥♥ you flamers and BM garbageNice story campaigns which reward you with basic cardsController friendly and it works good enoughClear recommendation for the great experience and reward structure this game got to offer compared to many competitors in the digital TCG market.DetailsMagic Duels comes with an interesting deck building limit which seperates it from the traditional trading card game (TCG). You can only put 3 uncommons and 2 rares with the same name in your deck. Mythic rarity cards are limited to one each. This results in a deck building environment which I personally as it discerns itself clearly from the TCG. As a result the size of boosters containing 6 cards instead of the 15 cards you may be used to weights lighter. A booster comes with 3 common, 2 uncommon and 1 rare or mythic cards. Sets are smaller than in the original game because the developers don't invest too much time adding mechanical overly complex cards to the game but still big enough to promote many different deck archetypes.You can easily get 2 boosters for 300 gold with the multiple daily quest rewards and some wins probably while completing the dailies on Versus Mode against other players. In detail a win or an enemy forfeit mid-game rewards you with 30 gold while daily quests give you 60-120 gold depending on the complexity of the quest. Matches against random NPCs reward you between 5-20 gold depending on difficulty level. You get 2 new quests daily and have 3 quest slots at hand. Many daily quests can be completed in NPC matches as well.If the enemy forfeits in online matchmaking, an AI takes over giving you the choice to continue the game. Rewards remain the same if the enemy did not leave immediately upon connecting to the match. It is funny to see people quitting because of bad draws and me getting then royally ♥♥♥♥ed by the AI because my draw also was not good. Getting them gold while losing a hard match is fun for me personally but might not be up everyones alley.The NPC content is throughout with multiple campaigns which grant you prebuild decks and show you the different mechanics the card sets in Magic Duels got to offer. Completing a campaign rewards you with a selection of pre-defined cards of the specific set you completed the story for. I don't know how long random NPC matches might satisfy players not comfortable playing against other players but as of writing I have you to beat a hard difficulty NPC.",1

Music must be turned on in this game, it is good Active developer feedbackNeutrals Akin to a grinding korean game, however quests are lined up everywhere. You will only encounter a few bumps that will require grinding some zones Auction house, marketplace setup is similar to maplestory/ragnarok's. Nothing special, but important to be decent enough.

Yes, it was a pro because it was a breath of fresh air from other things because they make sure you have to use spells you've learned early on, but per job rank-up you only get two options each time. Sure, you do rank up a lot of times, but variety would be lovely. Contradictory to this, it will be hard to balance ( see any MOBA ) therefore this belongs in neutral and not consCons Unbalanced, seeing from closed beta 2.

13838,Robocraft,2016.0,"This game is a fine example of wasted potential.Everything was fine in the early years, there was variety, there was fairness, there was a GOOD F**KIN GAME. Then they started adding updates that raised a whole lot of suspicion. Firstly, they removed tier 1 wings, balloons, and other types of flight modules. I can only assume they wanted to make sure players understood the game a wee bit better before they went super complicated, but its more likely that they wanted to suck money out of all the people who lost their flying vehicles by paying to get to the stuff they used to have. Over time, the game got worse and worse, player outrage followed, it was only a matter of time before IT happened. and then IT happened, the loot box update, this update ditched the Tech tree for parts in favor of a loot box system that was worse than the tech tree in almost every single way. Player riots followed, protests, petitions, etc. Newbie and Veteran players alike left en masse as the game was now a hollow shell of what it once was. I stayed behind, hoping that they would return to the old ways. I was wrong, the curency system was changed, you were given rewards base on performance (Ie. the better you do, the better your reward) This created a strong sense of Teamwork and assistance between others. Over the course of 1 update, that was gone. I've played video games ever since I was 3 years old, I can remember the first game I ever played (Crash Bandicoot 2 on the PS1) and ive seen some of the best of the best (Ie. Super mario Galaxy) and the lowest of the low (Stuff like The Slaughtering Grounds by Digital Homicide LLC). I went from casual to regular to Hardcore Gamer over the years. I play to win and to have a damn good time doing so. I dont play to get an RNG chest and get worthless crap that is only there to make me even more annoyed than I should be.

11405,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewSecretly installs the Gajin program to your computer. It also sets up your computer to auto seed the download to other users. Would not reccomend the game, especially since it secretly installs a client to run in the background and doesn't warn you or say anything when the game installs, unlike most other games that do this. Also the Gajin client stays on your computer even when you uninstall the game. I realize that other games install clients or launchers do this, but they have a popup when they do so and ask if you want to install their 3rd party client.The game itself runs bettter than most other BR games though and there is a bit of fun to be had for a few hours but the game only has 30 people per match",0
8602,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,"As requested by a loyal fan, here is my review of Sakura Clicker.This game was created by the same folks behind the classic ""Sakura Swimclub"" and ""Sakura Dungeon"", but instead of the visual novel flare, this game instead is based upon the browser game ""cookie clicker"" where you click a cookie, however, in Sakura clicker, you are instead clicking on anime girls. as you progress, the girls you click on will gain more health, requiring you to hire new girls who do more damage to aid in adding the enemy girls to your harem (this also includes bosses). Gold is usually used to hire new girls, but beyond this, there is an underlying method of levelling girls, for example; to unlock abilities like added 5% gold per girl or +20% damage you may have to spend gold to get a hero to lv100 for an added 100% attack bonus. Additionally, it is possible to prestige to gain bonuses at the cost of your progress. A mechanic which I enjoyed was how you could close the game, but when you return you are rewarded with gold which you would have earned if you had stayed on, but returning to the game may be required for fighting bosses, requiring your presence to click and activate abilities (gained once leveling up the main hero). Another aspect of the game I found interesting was how every (enemy) girl has a slightly different look, whether it is the apparel, hair or eye colour. The music on the other hand does suffer from being repetitious. As far as I am aware, there is no story to date or lore, as well as no ending, or character development, however there is a girl by the side of the screen whom you can customise with a small variety of free hair, skin, eye and clothing options for free, but beyond these are microtransations for weapon, clothes and hair dlc (which Im personally not a fan of, but does not harm the core gameplay). All in all, it is a solid clicker game, another hit by the Sakura Team.Recommend that you play the game with the music and sound effects off, with the voice left on.Another gripe of mine would be the absence of a ~buff man in the game.",1

19458,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter recent developments, I no longer recommend this game or this developer to anyone.EDIT: Since the developer chose to chime in with a BS reply: Spyware, by definition: ""Spyware is software that aims to gather information about a person or organization without their knowledge, that may send such information to another entity without the consumer's consent, or that asserts control over a device without the consumer's knowledge.""RedShell is literally software that aims to gather information about us as consumers without our knowledge. It collects information from browsing history to note if that user has seen or engaged with their advertising efforts to check for their efficacy. That information is then sent to another entity (the developer) without the consumer's consent.RedShell fits perfectly into the definition. The developer is arguing this isn't the case because there is no 'personal' information... Even if it is the case that there is no way to reverse engineer the source (which seems to be a dubious proposition that RedShell merely recommends, not enforces), that doesn't matter. Any data collected via software with no consent and without one's knowledge qualifies as Spyware, and RedShell is that. Our spending habits, our advertisement engagement, that's our data that we own. It has value. If they want it, they can either pay us for it or do the ethical thing and just ask. That's all it takes. A quick pop up, ""Hey, can we gather anonymous system information to help us determine how to best advertise our game and expand our outreach? It would really help us expand the community!"", ""Why of course, game that I like, have followed, and want to see flourish. I'd be more than happy to help out in my small way.""But no, instead of that, we get a BS response like below doing whatever they can to deflect any guilt after getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar. My original review above remains, and if anything, should be hardened further.Let me also add that I am not just some random person looking to insult the game.

826,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewOK so this is my 3rd time editing the review, this time changing the negative review to positive.In my last review I mentioned that the game has a great future and is a great concept but it was very unbalanced and needed some fixing instead of upgrading particle effects and stuff.And the developers fixed it, the game got much much better, they added new modes which solves the main problem of tryhards they got more generous to the players and let them get hardly obtainable items easily obtainble and so on. But obviously there still are problems which they're working on, the developers are doing pretty good I'll be honest The problems are: the player base if you and your friend are searching at the same time you could even meet them but they're doing a lot of giveaways to  get a legit playerbase, also supporting twitch streamers to promote the game and so on. Also another problem is deck building, it's really hard to build a stable deck, over updates a lot of cards get nerfed and buffed, you need to be able to stand everything: giant 1 unit cards, hordes, flying units, long ranged units, etc.The game does have a high price for what it is but it's practically free, you can really easily get it from a giveaway and there's always at least one Minion Masters giveaway at a time. So I suggest giving the game a go, if you're into strategy and planning and stuff, it's really fun and competitive, it's free after all and it's really fun with friends and they're gonna release 2v2 any time soon so it'll be great to play with friends.",1

The larger environments don't have anything to keep them going. One thing about the first game was how tight and well designed its levels were, but that's gone now. It's like the microtransaction model was made to rely on past players, but the design doesn't attract them.",0

Despite being grindy, it is more tolerable since it gives you more money and experience per battle than its cousins, the World of Tanks.Of course, each games took longer, let say you are average gamer, you might spend 10 mins for each battle. Even if you are ""noob"", it is likely that you survive for 5 minutes. In his other game, the WoT, if you are ""noob"" you will be dead within seconds after you spawn.

14970,Fishing Planet,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFishplanet, is a good fishing simulator. There are a lot of good features in this game. One thing that would make this game even better, is if there  were more locations in the world to fish in E.g Australia for instance, New Zealand, Canada and more international countries.So Devs, pleaes try to add a variety of countries in the game. What also be nice is Steam achievements, that's make it a whole lot better.If you guys are looking for a different type of game that is calm and relaxing, I would strongly recommend this game. It's a very good open world(Not really open world as of yet) game, and if you're into fishing, I'd probabaly check it out.

With Neverwinter I find the gameplay fun enough that I have managed to level up to 64 quite pleasantly. I am a big fan of Dungeons and Dragons, so it is a lot of fun to see monsters and locations from the famous Forgotten Realms setting. The zones are mostly pretty cool to romp around in and I find the combat fun, which is good because almost all quests are of the kill X monsters type. I have set myself up with a controller by using a key mapping software called AntiMicro, which is working really well and lets me chill out and play it with controller, which it is designed for in any case. 64 levels in and I've not spent a penny, which is pretty good!",1
3062,Creativerse,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewKeep in mind that I only have a few hours into the game as I'm writing this, and that the game is in Early Access.+ Fluent Combat(compared to many other voxel games)+ Graphics are gorgeous(compared to many other voxel games)+ Good Soundtrack+ Nice Tiering system, gives the feeling you are actually progressing+ Lots and LOTS of stuff to play around with(and it seems there is much more to come)+ Seems there is a lot to do and discover- Crafting items is smashed all over the place(First you need to craft something in your Q menu, then you have to use machine A to craft piece B, and then you have to combine it with Piece C that has been created in machine X... you get my point. It's rather overwhelming, and quite time consuming)- Interface needs improvement(As for now, you have to browse huge lists just to find that one thing you want to make. And the further you go, the bigger the lists become. Seriously needs a few QoL improvements there)- Monster AI is quite derpy, sometimes ignoring people completely- Once you got your basic set, the game isn't very challenging anymore(unlike items, it doesn't feel there are different many tiers of monsters out there(... yet?))- Standard occasional bugs(no major crashing yet, just a few silly bugs like being stuck in the ceiling after jumping on the bed x.x)(+ you can jump on the bed)- FPS drops a little when venturing underground(Nothing major, but slower comps might notice it)As it is now, It's the typical Early Access game. It's playable, it's enjoyable, and it has great potential. There has been a lot of thought put into the game, and I appreciate it. The game isn't there yet, hence the EA status. It's up to the devs whether this game will become a master piece, or another could-have-been-awesome.I will update my review if it turns out to be the latter, but until then, download and give it a try!",1

1713,Aura Kingdom,2017.0,"I have always dreamed of living out my life in the body of tiny, kawaii desu little japanese girl with pink hair. I thought to myself, ""Wow, Aura Kingdom?"" That looks tight as ♥♥♥♥. I downloaded it and I was like, ""HOT DAMN. I GET TO BE A TINY, KAWAII DESU LITTLE JAPANESE GIRL WITH PINK HAIR...AND...I GET TO BE A SWORD EXPERT???"" Right away, my heart started pouding with the intense anticipation that I felt as it downloaded. When it finally was done, I clicked it and opened and I made an account and I was like, ""Yes. My dreams, today, will come TRUE."" When was deciding upon what kind of character to make, instantly I knew she had to be female, and instantly, I knew she had to have pink hair. Though, when looking at designing my character, I thought, ""Maybe theres like, a little bit of similiarities between all these hair styles and stuff?"" But then I quickly brushed that thought aside when I remembered, ""HEY! I CAN JUST DO THE REALLY GOOD THING AND LIKE PAY TEN BUCKS OR WHATEVER TO GET THE SPECIAL PTW HAIR!"" And I just put the hair on, and I was like, ""Yeah, pigtails are like just a good option."" So, with my pink pigtails in tow, I made the name of my character and I was like, ""Yeah something japanese would do, i guess"" and typed in something, i don't know, it was probably japense? Sounded like it? Dont know if it really was. I like anime, but like, I've only been into for like two and half weeks so Im not really sure. I took chinese in highschool, so it might've been a chinese name? But then again, I was binging sword art onlne before i made my character so it couldve been influenced by that and I think it might have been- anyways, the point is, I TRIED to name her something japanese, so hopefully it worked. Anyways...So I got her good and ready to go and it started me off in like, this tutorial thing right? And I was like ,"" OH LOOK, anime guys who look like anime girls wearing big bulkly anime armour"" and i thought ""Hot damn, Im in for a hell of a bumpy and exciting romantic and adventerous ride"" whoops i forgot what i was typed oh yeah ""Now time to do this tutorial"" and i did the tutorial and it was like, kind of weird? Like im really bad at video games so i dont reall yknow. Like i dont have any MASS MULTIPLE PLAYERS ONLINE experiecne, so i dont know how good of a MASS MULTIPLE PERSONS ONLINE game this is? But i would say pretty good. I really like how if you dont play games really good and you dont know how to walk inside a game, you can just click on the quest and it would make you auto run to the quest and when you get there if you still dont know what to do you can click on the quest and it would do it for you. Like ""How do i fight thing? Im bad at games and im not very athletic and i dont know how to swing swords irl"" and then the game was just like ""♥♥♥♥ yeah dude let me hit the rodent for you"" and then it boom man quest OVER HELL YEAH I DID IT MYSELF ALL ON MY OWN  So then yeah, it just took me to the next quest and it workedsometimes i can make my character ride on a moon and the moon would just drive me to my quests and then like drop me off and then pick me back up again when I needed a ride and that worked pretty well my payed outfit lokoed pretty sweet. though i cant really show it off because every time im online im literally the only other god damn person on the whole ♥♥♥♥ing server so thats a little lonely but im actually an introvert so i dont mind i dont like being social so this game for me im cool with it. so con, lack of social interaction, and auto completed quests.   but other than that i think its a pretty perfect game well rounded im deducting like ten points because i cant make my character a cat?

I haven't been able to progress through the story much for the last two days because everytime I try, the server disconnects (and no, it's not my computer or internet connection). Another thing to keep in mind, you might as well play the windowed version and keep a browser up in the background because you will constantly be searching for vendor recipes, etc. It's interesting that it doesn't have one base currency like so many other games, but can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥sometimes with such limited inventory space. I hope you like Tetris because you will be playing a lot of it in this game. It'd also be nice to have auras and certain summons not take up skill slots in order to be used.

17957,Star Trek Online,2015.0,"This game has become a bugfest. There are bugs almost everywhere in the game. The developers don't care about fixing them. They turn a blind eye to feedback from the playerbase. On the forums topics are being locked that provide negative feedback about the game. They only focuss on filling their own wallet's. They keep adding broken content and the amount of bugs keeps getting bigger. They fix 1 bug? 10 new bugs appear to replace the one they fixed. Their hardware is crap. Everyone gets disconnected from the game every few hours due to ""server not responding"". Yet the developers keep saying everything is working as intended and that the problem always lies on the side of the customers.The 5 year anniversary is the latest example of Cryptic's incompetence. The first 48 hours after the 5 year anniversary launch the game was unplayable because of the high amount of players logging into the game at the same time. What was the developer team's response? They told us to wait 2-3 days until everyone has finished patching their clients. Yet again this new content is filled with bugs and some of it isn't even playable because missions can't be completed.I have never, ever seen an MMO go downhill as badly as Star Trek Online. MMO's are supposed to be stable due to the high amount of players playing the game. But with Cryptic? With them: ""everything is working as intended"". I'm a big fan of Star Trek, and this game is the closest thing a Star Trek fan can have to an MMO representing the Star Trek universe. But it all gets ruined by a company that is only interested in filling their own pockets. I have endured this mess long enough. But enough is enough.If you are curious about the game but not familiar with the world of Star Trek, It's not worth it.

But if you're just looking for something interesting to kick back with and not have to think too much (like myself), I would recommend avoiding this game, or at least download with caution, as the amount of easy/free/enjoyable gameplay won't take you far past 3-4 hours.This game has a really interesting concept, and I'd love to see what other guns and modes it grows to encompass, but doing something ridiculously difficult again and again and again just isn't for me.",0

Infact, this game is so geniusly built i would actually be proud to say this is what Diablo III Should have been. (Sorry Blizzard, comming from a huge Blizzard game supporter in my past) The customization and variations of this game are so vast beyond anyones wildest dreams, I absolutely love it. Your currency system is GENIUS as well, its exactly what a game like Diablo lacked. Gold became really useless in late Diablo 2 gameplay, even in D3. It was really sad. Your currency system designed here keeps every currency in demand. No matter how far into the game you are.Ontop of this overwhelmingly amazingly positive review, you keep releasing more and more things that will keep this game alive for years to come and that truely takes talent.Leagues- BrilliantMore Skill gems!!! WOW EVEN MORE CUSTOMIZATION TO YOUR TALENT TREE BUILDS!!!!Reward incentives.And yet again, if you could put anymore cherries ontop of this wonderful cake that you already have, the game is FREE! Yet again, your genius plan works. Microtransaction is the way of the future! You keep huge respect for your games F2P Scene but yet if a player wants to spend a little money to customize their Character, they can by choice.MY ONLY COMPLAINTS about this game  (Which is extremely hard to fix) is your rubber banding system. I dont know if it is because of lack of servers around the world or not, but it has adressed me some serious problems when playing Hardcore mode in your game. And i know that is disheartening to any gamer. My other complaint, which really isnt even a complaint, is this games graphics. Its not a deal breaker by any means, but  feel like it could use some improvement.All in all I would rate Path of Exile a 9/10 since you seem to keep improving this game further and further.

1737,Crush Crush,2017.0,"Crush Crush seems like it should be a game I don't like. Yet somehow I'm still putting time into it.Let's be fair here though, this isn't your typical ""boot up and spend a few hours at a time"" type of game. It's an idle game that relies on resource allocation (in this case, time) in order to raise affection levels and earn money to progress through multiple relationship levels of the girls. Earning achievements unlocks more time slots that can allow for more activities active at once. Hobbies increase your attractiveness to the girls and also unlock jobs, which can be worked at to earn money and promotions to higher tiered jobs.Each girl has a set of conditions at each relationship level. This starts off simple like needing some affection and money to unlock the next level. As you progress you can go on dates or give gifts to meet more criteria. Earning affection is done through clicking, but once you start getting the hobbies levelled up the affection levels will also increase automatically depending on hobby level. This is largely where the idle part comes in, as you assign time to tasks and then let the game take care of them itself, logging back in to alter tasks as needed. Daily events are also a thing, using up time slots to earn bonuses like money or a time skip. Some daily events also offer unique rewards if you participate enough like special costumes or poster images, although needing to log in at least twice in a day for them (once to start the timer, once to claim the reward before events change) is annoying.Admittedly, I probably wouldn't be that interested if not for the girls themselves. There are quite a few girls to meet with brief backgrounds showing how you met (often in disastrous ways). What shines is your interactions with them, like Mio who is a walking goldmine of video game references, Quill who lives the life of a cat and we can't forget BEARVERLY WHO IS LITERALLY A BEAR.While it is a recommendation, the game does have one major flaw currently. Even after paying for some premium currency and buying a x64 speed multiplier I still find I've run up against a wall in progression. The further down the list of girls you go the higher their requirements are. If you think Nina requiring a car is bad just wait until you meet the girl that requires 10,000 of them. There will eventually come a point where you will just have to rely on time to get those later down the list.",1
11075,Neverwinter,2014.0,"I really like this game. I almost didn't bother with it after seeing such bad reviews. I realize that this is a free to play MMORPG. Something a company thought of to give the public something to do with their time. These reviews sadden me because I feel like the people who wrote them were being truly ungrateful. Some things you do need to buy but they give a lot of different items so you don't have to pay. You get a horse for crying out loud for 5 gold and a variety of companions for 2. Some games that's completely impossible. You can get astral diamonds from the online gateway and you get nearly 10,000 a day for repeatable quest, PLUS you can sell any rare items to accumulate more astral. You can even get rare pets from events pretty easily. I recently got a flame sprite, and it's awesome,  if you don't have 300,000+ in a month then it's probably not the games fault. It's probably yours because everyone has a life but the game gives you what you need to be successful. I haven't gotten to the higher levels yet BUT so far I've leveled up VERY easily with no problems. Runestones are dropped left and right from any dungeon. I love the dungeons, I love how it's practically got a video game type interface. Don't let the reviews make you turn away from this game. Check it out yourself. If you like it fine, if you don't, that's fine too, but don't leave a nasty review making other people turn away because YOU can't get something you might want. I recently got a 3ds and I am thankful. I am not going to complain about how I have very limited games or about the color. Going to be grateful the damn thing was free. Not all games are for everyone but that doesn't mean it deserves such negativity that half of these reviews displayed.",1
19368,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,I wanted to like this game but I have barely played 30 minutes and ran into bugs. *I probably shouldn't complain because it's free* but they are game breaking for me and I wasted more time trying to get them to run then playing.,0
581,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2016.0,"Overall a good game, It's built well.. If you like time consuming games where you just sit and stare at a screen like I do, this is the game for you.

3372,Creativerse,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewUnbelievably addictive, this game hits the nail on the head. It mixes a creative environment with adventure and an exciting amount of suspenseful danger.

3740,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewWriting this review was not easy to me because I really wanted to like this game way much more... I was searching something less p2w feeling than Hearstone and ECG was a good answer to that... Playing ECG is fun and enjoyable, even if you need quite some grinding to reach a decent number of Legendary cards for ladder ranking decks (that everybody use), there are plenty of option for solo or pvp playing and rewarding allows you to increase your collection over time.This game has an issue toh... and a big one. The way it handles mana is quite disturbing: mana flood or mana screw are so easly to happen that you find yourself loosing or winning A LOT of matches just because that happens to you or to your opponent. While there are some mitigation you can put in your deck, this still a point that force you to rely more on your mana luck than in your actual deck composition. After a while this get to a point that the fun with the game fade away.The only deck that does not suffer of this too much is rakano aggro because you can basically play your entire deck with 3 or 4  mana which is easy to get...I bought a 50$ founder pack to suppor developers but this mana issue does not encourage me to invest more on the game nor spending my gems to buy cards that I would not be able to play because of mana issues.Someone suggested to have two separate decks, one with mana cards and one with the rest. That seems a very good option to solve this issue but it looks unlucky they will ever implement this...",0

8623,AdventureQuest 3D,2018.0,Early Access ReviewI have always liked AQW and this game is no different. Though unlike other MMO's its fighting system is not as complicated I find it to be a nice break from the complexity games like WOW or Black Desert bring around. Being a pre-release I still think it is quite good I havent personally ran into too many game breaking glitches. When I play I always have fun and hope this game goes places. My only real complaint for the game is how the character models are made. I hope to see something more detailed and smooth in the future and please no more drawn on faces.,1
2291,AdventureQuest 3D,2017.0,Early Access ReviewIts still in beta but sofar its worth it all.

I strongly suggest that you buy one of the guardian packs if you plan on buying premium currnecy,1
927,WARMODE,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI want to reccommend this game. I really do.Sad thing is the servers are all located in Russia. So my lag is really really bad.(If they add servers, like Asian ones. I'd probably enjoy this game more.)The graphics are fine, and i really see the POTENTIAL for this to be a great f2p.(unless they make it a game you should buy, which i am not sure about.)If, and maybe if. The Developers fix some things (Like the ugh, text buy menu), get a better anticheat (maybe?)I want to be able to play this again in the future. Perhaps when they fully release it?Or rather when they fix most of it/ add more servers / put a ping checker.I want to believe. I really do.",0
4015,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEveryone who gives this game a positive review are blind.... For starters i refunded the game, because it's not worth the 40$ not even 30$. The devs said the game will improve and will be optimized better, but it's worse then the Korean version was... And let's be real... It's a game that runs on DX9, YES DX9 IN 2018, it's impossible to optimize a game on DX9 for new pc... I thought it will be at the minimum dx10 but no... It's still DX9 and even that is working like♥♥♥♥♥♥ so you can't get stable FPS even if you have the newest ryzen Oc at 4.4ghz and a 1080Ti.. I still get 15-120fps and in city's or crowded areas are just plain unplayable... The game is censored, a lot of key elements from the story is cut and makes holes in the plot. The combat is the only pozitiv thing about this game, and that to is not the best or even that god...The translation... Well it's impossible to understand it's so bad... And there is a lot more but these are the key things im very disappointed. So god luck for those who think this game will survive like this... For starters, if they wanted a smoth start why didn't they make a beta test of 2-3days for those that bought the founders pack? Because they know the game is in a state that is unplayable after 7-8years of development and multiple fails... And this is the reality of this game. God luck for all who still play the game....",0
6173,Brawlhalla,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat game, But needs a TON more work done on it before it's a title worth spending any money on. (Though the devs look like they will be delivering that ton more content it needs.)      For those complaining about the online being hard it's because people playing this game on the PC are not used to brawlers or the strategy involved in them.(Not many brawler type games for the PC, even fewer have online gameplay.)      One good tip is when one guy has 9 points and the rest of the team is averaging around 2 then they need to work together to get the points balanced again.      Otherwise the guy with 9 point just has to get hit once by the lowest scorer and ""accidentally"" fall off the map whenever his damage is high to keep anyone else from getting anywhere near him score wise. (Easy win for anyone who actually read this.) There are many other tips and tricks assosiated with games exactly like this. But I'm too lazy to list em all.       Just use your heads people. (Something that pc gamers have been doing allot less of since game capable computers have become easily affordable for the generall public. Lets not end up like console online gaming.)     I wrote this review in hopes that I can inspire better tactics in the player base.... it's way to easy to win at the moment and it makes the game dull.     Review cap  Highest scorer= Biggest threat.                       and Feeding the weakest player when damage is high= Easy wins.",1

Hey you guys do know that WoT PC. Big Wot(The one on Worldoftanks.com) not Baby WoT(Blitz)is a huuuugeee file. Like 40GB's i think. Maybe? I dunno & i don't care all i know is that it's a good game. I'm not looking at this like ""Oh for shame on you WG.. We wanted WoT on steam.. & this is how you pay us? With WoT Blitz? UNACCEPTABLE!"" If your like that. Fine! Go play World of tanks. But WORLD OF TANKS BLITZ is DIFFERENT!! They both do great at what they want to portait here. WoT(big WoT) is great at realism while WoTB(Baby WoT) is good for those who have a terrible computer & still want the World of Tanks expirience. In my opinion they are both different games, you cant say that one is worse that the other cause one of them is originaly a mobile game. AND dont say that WoT(Big WoT) is a saint. Cause your wrong. They both have thier flaws, & thier stengths. But they also have different audiences. WoTB is for people who dont like the console version but yet still wants a competitive yet fair playing field in a quick matter. While WoT(The one that EVERYBODY is saying that you should go DL instead) is for those who want to play a game that is a bit more detailed & historicaly driven but pretty is much the same. imo.

1668,Aura Kingdom,2015.0,"Honest Review:  Alright started  playing this game and never had questions on how to do something ,meaning the tutorials are great and easy for people to understand.    Things that annoyed me:1)To access higher level maps you have to do the main story line meaning you can do dungeons all the way to the max lvl 75 but if you havn't  done the quest line you will be stuck in a 1-30 lvl zone until  you do so. Why is this bad? Making a new character will be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥since you got to do the same questline over and over again, you are forced into doing the quest line.2)This game is very strict on censorship , there is no turn off swear filter button any typo that you do will be bleep by these annoying a** s**t.3)Auction houses - you know how you can put a price per unit on something your selling ? Well yea not in this f**king game you have to put a price on the whole thing meaning they have to buy your thing in bulk or you won't get any sales and get this you can only put the item in the auction for 1 day ,oh and it is also taxed.4)PvP blows - it is a type of event in the game meaning you have to get on a certain time of the day in order to join and i don't even reccomend joining if you aern't max level.You don't recieve bonus stats or game changing stats for that matter if your lvl 20 going up against a lvl 75 you will miss everything, your stuns won't even register and you will be a target by all players since you WILL get one shotted.Negative♥♥♥♥♥♥aside- The game allows you to respec your stats and masteries (not your class) for ingame currency ( The one you earn) you can also chose a sub-class at lvl 40 for example i make a gaurdian and at lvl 40 i get a quest in order to be a part bard to get its healing abilities.I reccomend this game though not bad when PvE gameplay is involved .

6788,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"Excellent free-to-play Hearthstone'esque clone. The model is similar, for anyone familiar with the digital CCG. The game reinvents the wheel enough to make it the better offering as of 2017. Daily quests reward players with gold that can be used to buy packs, get entries into solo or versus player arenas, or can be used to buy bonus content that would otherwise normally be stuck behind a paywall. Cards that you own more than 3 copies of can be sharded to craft other cards you don't own, eventually amassing enough of a collection to venture into constructed play. The game itself is just so much more intriguing than Hearthstone, given the multiple lanes, rune additions, and deck combinations between the various stats. Play this at least for the free solo story campaign that lasts ~4 hours! As of 06/28/2017 Heroes of Skyrim expansion is out, adding in an additional 150 cards and all sorts of fun!

You get it, read tutorial steps once and you are ready to go. It involves skill on a different level, not only do you think about your command combo's but you actually have to know where you will stand. you can see red circles for charging/casting moves from enemies, there is a very accurate dodge system that you have to use yourself by pressing ""shift"" (limited stamina). And many more various other powers, passive abilities, mounts and pets. It can be a very friendly community, because Neverwinter has a system where it parties you up, if you need/choose. No constant standing around waiting for a nice group to let you in to Clear Dungeons, Onslaught Skirmishes, and more.  This game is free, it's great.

16417,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewFor a fishing game, and me being a fisheran, I have found this game to be very true in so many respects, while there are some minor problems with how the ine acts, and reacts to the water, and the casting mechanics can sometimes be wonky, HOWEVER, the fish all respond the proper way, they hit the baits the same way real fish do, and their fights are much the same as in real life as ye can get without actually feeling the rod bend in your hands and the thrill of the first solid hook. The only other problem is that it will run your video card on the hot side due to the fact that they rendered the entire space and the trees on the far side of the water area, as wel as the water surface and reflections, so that graphics card can get a real workout, but it is VERY Much Worth it if you are a real fisherman.  So far I have managed to take the time and slowly, oh so slowly, bring in a 17+lb Flathead Catfish on 8 lb test.  Just a matter of playing him out, letting him run under light but constant, wearing tension, the tension keeps it moving to escape, which will, eventually, hopefully, tire it out so that you can then slowly bring it in to you.  So, I would Heartily Reccomend this game to any and all folks wo either fish or would like to learn how.Say ""HI"" to Cutch fer me, I visited him long ago and got my copy of DeerHunter 2K5 from him, such a good fellow, knew some of the folks my grandparents did, similar hunting and fishing areas, and he was an excellent games tester as for the reality end.!Chuck Sweet as Steelwolf",1

2766,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Brutally Charming.Let's tackle some of the issues players have been having with the game, And some of the misleading reviews, and then let's go on to discuss briefly the actual state of the game as a whole.MicrotransactionsPeople seem to be very upset with the microtransaction system in place, limiting the features of the game.  This is misleading.  The tokens that give your account premium for 30 days are purchasable through the Auction House in game and are extremely affordable currently.  The Current Cost of a monthly premium token on the Auction House : 500kThe problem arises in that there are still restrictions even with the monthly token. Are they annoying, yes.  Will it cost you money to unlock premium?  Not at all.Server Maintenance/Lag IssuesI've been playing MMO's long enough to know that stepping into the grind day one is not the wisest decision.  Every night I receive several rewards in game, and problems get fixed.  It happens.  Personally the biggest problems that friends and myself have encountered so far have already been fixed, but there are some issues that absolutely need to be fixed in the near future, and that I have no doubt will be.  Nothing I would consider game breaking.  Side Note : they have also added two new brand new servers for different world locations since release.  Work is getting done.Disappointing?  Yes.  Overall?  Expected.A Warning to New PlayersDo not start in Orsha.  No matter what. I'll be blatently clear about this, This area is unfinished, unpolished, and requires a steadily more intense amount of grind, even including an area from 40-60 where there just simply seems to be zero quests, and nothing to help push you through.  Start in Klaipeda.  The storyline is well polished, satisfying, has many more rewards than the Orsha side, and doesn't brick wall you on your quest to level 300 nearly as often.  Do not confuse this with the server also named Orsha,  I am strictly speaking of the starting city options during character select.Performance1. The client needs to be restarted entirely every few hours, I would say 4 is a nice round number to be safe.  Load times can significantly increase as memory does ableit slowly.2. The game crashes sometimes.  Thankfully it takes a whopping 4 seconds to boot to menu. 3. I get consistantly excellent frames 30-80 during game, and unlike most modern games, your frames do not directly impact the visual appeal or performance of this game in any fundamental way.  It is however extremely noticeable in cities where population can be absurdly high at times.4.  No matter how hard my internet chokes, burps, deflates, or otherwise acts up, I stay connected to the game and can resume my gameplay without being punished for it. (This may mean a lot to some of you, I thought you should know.)Current State of the Game/My personal ReviewThis game is a diamond in the rough.  It's a beautiful, and sometimes brutally charming isometric styled grind em up that wants to be played.  The controller support is excellent, my couch can attest to that, And I don't have to think too much about what I'm doing.  I just like to sit back and explode all the things, and so far I keep getting rewarded for my behaviour and I can appreciate that in a game.  I keep getting these deep Diablo feels, and the game keeps reminding me of its FFT/RO inspirations.  The game is unfinished, put simply.  But I don't seem to mind.  I've been disappointed, engaged, surprised, I've muted the music only to unmute it later, finding that I enjoyed it in the backround.  I've raised a pet by force feeding it silver until it now succesfully headbutts things at the speed of smell.   Ultimately there's a lot I would do to change this game to what I want it to be.  But it's not my game, I'm just here to play it.  And I've been enjoying that so far.  For all my disappointment in it not being the next Tactics Game, It does a lot of things right.  And it keeps it simple, from the gui and large easy to read buttons, to the immediateness of slapping a controller in my palm and booting the game up in just a few seconds.  It's more of a sequal to Maple Story, minus the socialite nonsense.  You just get to look cool, be what you want to be, and kill thousands of monsters.  And that's just what I signed up for.",1

20198,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access Review EDIT: Don't buy it. You know, I ended up finally letting common sense kick in for a little. I really wanted to like this game, and I really wanted to be a part of it and the community, but then I just added up all the development mistakes that have happened in the past few months during the port, with the fact that it's a game that's failed in other regions not only due to its awkward combat, but the base game itself. Yes, it's listed as an alpha game, but every other port of this type (BDO, Archeage, etc) started out as an almost fully working game, with some bugs, or misstranslations here and there. Bless started out with tooltips that make almost no sense, and bugs so severe that areas reload as you're in them, over and over and over again. I tried to push myself to play on a Berzerker (the only class with a working action camera), and I was just flooded with bugs and grindyness that it wasn't worth pushing though it. I  wanted  to love Bless. But in reality, if a game is coming to a new region, with their primary feature being a revamped and fun combat (that's not even fully implemented in the 5 classes they claimed to have adapted it to) it's just a bunch of fluff to a broken game. Maybe they'll work on it down the road, fix their laggy UI, actually implement the action camera, add a dodge mechanic to most classes that interupts animations (you'll find yourself animation locked in telegraphs a LOT), hire someone to translate their UI instead of using an auto translator (You've obtained 2level! 10% damage increase taken reduction!). If you REALLY want to try it, go ahead. Maybe you can push past all the bugs and stay on it long enough for the developers to ""fix"" it. But they'll probably just look for a new region to port it to, I hear Oceania is the new hotspot for thrice failed launches. ----------------- Original Review ----------------- The game is actually pretty fun. Surprisingly fun considering how skeptical I was from the previous releases and how shady the development was.  (There’s a TLDR in the end) That being said, there are so many issues with it right now that I can’t really recommend it. So, I’m going to start out with the bad, and lead into the good. I haven’t played it for long (only had the chance to make two characters and get them past the tutorial) but there is a lot that can be said in terms of issues from there. Here’s what I’ve picked up so far: Breakdown  Graphics 3/5  - The game looks okay. It’s not great, and it’s not horrible. It’s basically a more realistic GW2 artstyle. The skills do look very neat, and the effects are enjoyable. The transition animations are horrible. If you’re walking in a straight line and turn left or right, your character snaps in whatever the direction you’re moving without any transitioning animations. Same for most skills, sometimes it looks like your spine is breaking in half to switch to whatever animation you’re transitioning into. It’s a bit awkward to look at, for me at least.Audio 4/5  – The soundtrack is nice, but the skill and weapon effects are amazing. You actually feel like you’re smacking down with your battle axe thing when you charge it up. It has a nice feeling to it combat wise. The voice acting is pretty bad, and you can’t tell if the voice actors didn’t care, or if they used Microsoft Sam for some of the voices. But the combat sound effects were so enjoyable that I only bumped a point off for the weird dialogue audio. Gameplay 2/5 or 4/5  – I’m having to give combat two scores, because it’s not fully implemented. If you’re playing a Berserker and you’re using the action camera, along with the combos, it’s really enjoyable. It doesn’t have the same excitement as BDO does, but it’s pretty good in it’s own way. It’s some weird hybrid that gives you a sense of flow, and lets you play around with the combos to figure out how to adjust your abilities to each situation. So 4/5 if you’re playing on the Berserker. For every other class, it’s a 2/5, because you’re stuck with a clunky tab targeting system and awkward movement animations that don’t look right. They’ve -disabled- the action camera system for every other class, without even warning the players. They’re supposed to bring them back at some point, but that’s just stuff I’ve head from other players. Story ?/5  – I can’t really judge the story yet, since I’ve only tickled it’s fancy. It seems like it has a lot of potential, if it wasn’t ruined by the awkward voice acting. The developers did make use of the generic evil villain with a robe and facemask, but I enjoy that type, so hopefully they’ll sort out the translations and voice acting soon. Pay2Win (No?)  – Doesn’t seem like it is, the cash shop gives you minor boosters, but nothing that makes you mega overpowered. It’s basically pay-to-level-a-little-faster. Costumes offer no bonuses, nor do they make you almost invisible to other players. (cough, cough, BDO Ghillie Suit, cough) Summary: It has the potential to be a really good game, I’m a huge mmo fanboy and love to play new games in the genre. Graphics are okay, and the sound effects are nice, combat and gameplay is pretty fun (on the ONE class it’s actually implemented in). If all of the classes had the action camera implemented, and the developers were more transparent about missing MAIN FEATURES, I’d definitely recommend Bless Online. But, at least for now, I’d say hold on to your wallets until the developers give us a proper announcement about what’s missing, why it’s missing, and when they plan on giving it to us. I understand that they’re still working on the Mystic/Assassin, and that’s fine, but it also looks like they’re working on four other classes and forgot to tell us.  Note:  You have to edit an .ini file to remove the profanity filter, and your characters don’t have nipples. They used to, but now they magically lost them during some weird censorship that happened. Not a deal breaker to me, but the game was made T rating friendly. TLDR:  I really want to recommend this game, but until there’s some proper communication from the developers about  BASE FEATURES  that were shown in trailers and promised to us (I’m looking at you, gameplay video of a ranger “aiming” to shoot her arrows) I can't do that.  Buy it at your own risk.  This review was done with consideration if this being an early access game. The main complaints are about things that were supposed to be in the base early access game, and that were removed without any major dev announcement, in some cases without any at all.  ",0
17427,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access Review        Buggy and imbalanced, But a fantastic take on the battle royale genre! The classes and weapon/ability forging system is super creative, intuitive, and a very nice mixup to the genre. Becoming a chicken as opposed to the usual ""downed"" state is so much more exciting, and frankly its hilariouos.

3000,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"I love this type of game, and I love Fallout, but this game is absolute garbage. It was obviously created entirely to bilk money from whales, and the gameplay is awful. I really wish it didn't have the Fallout name. Bethesda is really killing the Fallout brand.There's nothing fun about it. It's literally just a game of maintenance. There are no fun exploration aspects. When you send people out to explore, it's just text about what they're doing, and all you can do is recall them or tell them to continue exploring. There is a ""Rush"" mechanic to make your workers produce faster that sometimes fails and causes fires or nonsensical radroach invasions. There are loot boxes and every other manner of pay-2-win-style mechanics. I can't actually think of a single fun aspect of the game. I think it was literally designed just to psychologically manipulate people in to paying for their microtransactions. I wouldn't even call this a game.It's a disgrace that damages the Fallout brand.

For a new player this doesn't matter much, but for players that previously have played World of Warships this means the Steam version of the game offers NOTHING except a clean start. If that's what you're looking for as an old player then sure, it's a thumbs up. For other older players of WoWs like me a game that offers nothing can't get any recommendation at all, leaving ""no"" as the only recommendation option for the steam version of this game.",0
5584,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"I really enjoy the game, but you shouldn't get unless you willing to p2w and invest a lot of time. 74% of people who have the game  HAVEN'T even gotten the first objective done.You can f2p, will take more time though.",1
7539,theHunter Classic,2014.0,"Note: theHunter is a NICHE game. It's a wonderful niche game, don't get me wrong. But other than the gameplay itself, I have nothing but issues with it. Compare this game to the big name games out there... CoD, Bioshock, Farcry, Skyrim and so forth... ignore the genre. Production value and sales are what I'm comparing here. In all of these big name games have one thing in common. You buy the game, you can play it. All of it. You unlock gear and items as you play through. You don't have to buy additional junk just to complete missions/progress through the game. Occasionally you will have expansions or add-ons, more DLC that you can buy that will in most cases extend the gameplay, but in all cases will at least net you more content of some kind. So, I'll take CoD, one of the best known, most loved, and highest selling franchises in the gaming industry. I think I paid $60 when it first came out. That was it, for the whole game, all equipment, all levels and weapons attainable for that $60. Oh, I forgot to mention that you OWN the game at that point, you don't have to buy a membership to enjoy all of the games content. Now, theHunter. Free to Play? No, it's not mistitled. It's deceptively titled. The F2P portion conains one rifle, one scope, a bleat call, a camera, a GPS and binoculars. Oh, That's fine and all, but you only get to hunt ONE animal (Mule deer) on ONE reserve. If anything, it's a free demo. If you expect to see the rich content in this game, forget it. This ""demo"" is nothing more than a snapshot. Ok,... so that's what you've gotten for free. Let's spend $60 on this game, like we would any other, and see where it gets us. $45 for one year basic, and another $15 for three more months. That's it. That's what you get. I would love to say that you get more, but you don't. You get 15 months, with no additional gear, no additional weapons. Oh, you DO get the option to hunt on all the reserves. You also gt the licences to hunt all of these animals. But you still CAN'T because you haven't bought the proper weapons, proper ammo, proper equipment.... So you have to shell out more money just to take advantage of the fact you just shelled out $60 for 15 months of play time. What's that? Did I just hear someone squeak the words World of Warcraft? Denied. WoW at least gave you access to all of it's content after you've paid your subscription. And no, I'm not going to complain about the subscription, as WoW is/was an MMO. Gotta maintain those servers. Yeah, I know theHunter has multiplayer. Big deal. Out of the 20 people who enjoy multiplayer, theHunter could loose all 20 of them and still be a perfectly great game as single player only. You guys want to make more money? Add the cottontails and a crappy shot gun to the ""Free to Play"" version, and call it a free demo. Sell the game for $30, and monthly membership of $5. Make gear and weapons unlockable. Get rid of the microtransaction garbage. I would buy this game for $30. I would pay a $5 subscription, IF I had access to all of the games content after I made those purchases. That's at LEAST $35 you guys would have made from my first month. $5 and maybe even more a month after for my continues subscription. However, due to the way you guys have decided to sell this game, I've spent $15 for the subscription, had my fill becasue I refuse to spend more money on trivial, and temporary purchases, and that's it. You've made $15 from me, and you won't make any more. I don't recommend this game. Sure, download it, shoot a few mule deer, and call it quits. For the price you'll be paying to make anything in this game available for use and the fact that these are only temporary purchases, (subscription/consumables)  this game isn't worth the disk space it occupies. Even with WoW, purchased when it was released, and played for the first year at about $180 is still cheaper than this. You want a good hunting game? Play CoD, or FarCry, or Bioshock. You get to hunt people and monsters, you get tons of weapons to choose from, you don't have to pay a monthly subscription, and your purchases are yours to keep!! DON'T SPEND A DIME ON THIS GAME.  ",0

1246,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,"I've been playing the World of Tanks series of games (started out with normal World of Tanks for the PC, calling WoTM for now) for almost 6 years, and WoTB is quite a fun replacment. I lost my interest in WoTM because of the very broken artillary mechanic (and yes, I used the Arty as well, and found it quite broken, although they claimed to have changed it but I am skeptical), and when I was watching videos on WoTB, it had no arty in it what-so-ever, and I desided to try it out, and I found it to be quite fun, and I have been playing it non-stop ever sense. PROS: Smaller matches compaired to WoTM means quicker grinding for tank lines, and sometimes comical more chaotic battles. New Equipment System: Many players will disagree with my statements (and that is fine), and yes, although the old equipment system was very good, the new one is even better in my eyes. And I will say, at first, I absolutly hated it. The new system allows players to mount 9 different equipment types on there tanks, and all it takes is some grinding for ""Spare Parts"". Many players think the old one is better, most likely because all the needed to do was grind IGC (in game credits), but it only allowed us to mount 3 equipment types total, and some classes of tank, such as tier 5 tanks, wouldn't even get to mount certain equipments because they were too low tiered, namely the Gun Stabilizer, which in the old system could only be mounted in tier 8+ tanks, and now can be mounted on almost any tier. Tons of tanks to choose that fit most playstyles:There are tons of tanks in here, just like WoTM, bar Arty. If you want quick, zippy, deadly tanks, go down light tank paths. If you want a balance of power, go for medium tanks. If you like to camp in bushes and torture your victims, go for Tank Destoryers, and if you like to sit an laugh at people trying to hit your armor, go for heavy tanks. And as the game is still improving just like WoTM, more tanks are in the future. Good graphics and gameplay - nothing much to say, although they are not as HD as WoTM, for low-to-medium-end systems (somewhat like mine) they are perfect, but I am not into games for fancy graphics, I play for gameplay.Cash grinding is quicker do to smaller matches.Cons:Smaller matches compaired to WoTM. Although it has it's perks, if you come from WoTM, you might have some withdrawls from the old 15v15 and have to deal with the 7 v 7.Spare Parts System: Although the new equipment system is good, I will say that the Spare Parts system is somewhat flawed. We should at least earn 1000 spare parts for a victory and maybe 250 for a loss. I've only won about 300 for a victory. This makes getting equipment quite slow and somewhat annoying. The only way to get more than 1k spare parts is to complete missions, but these reset only every 12-24 hours (forgot which lol) To be honest people, the new equipment system really is awesome, but the amount we win spare parts at is too slow for it to be truely effective) - Update 3.10 claims to add new ways to earn more parts per battle. Overpowered tanks: Although a somewhat realistic feature (example, a Tiger II in real life would blow away a Sherman no problem), many tanks in here are too powerful for what they are. Some notable tanks are the Leopard Light Tank of tier 5, KV-2 of tier 6, LTTB of tier 7 to name a few. What makes them flawed is the raw damage output they can deal, the Leopard only had 2 varients built in real life, so not much is known about it. The KV-2 in game can 1 shot anything at tier 6 and below when using the 152mm gun, however in real life, this thing couldn't even turn it's turret when it was on a hill. LTTB reportedly broke it's suspention when traveling over rough turrain. The LTTB is also a light tank, and it moves as quick as many light tanks of lesser weight and armor, yet it has 90mm of hull armor. I don't think it should be moving that fast (perhaps why it failed in real life) However, these tanks are luckily not without flaws. Leopard has a long clip reload and poor armor. KV-2 has an insanely long reload (upwords of 20+ seconds), and the LTTB is quite large for a light tank and can be easily shot.There is also somewhat of a ""Russian Bias"" with this game, and many of the Russian tanks are quite overpowered, and seemingly the German tanks are underpowered (even though a real scenario would have the German tanks with the upper hand, depending on the crew, with a few exeptions on tanks) - luckily this bias isn't as great as it is in some games though. And yes, I am parcial to German tanks, but I also use British, American, and Russian, so this is from personal experience. The new ""Millitary Honor"" system:Absolute **** in my eyes. I've been having some stability issues with my computer, so sometimes my computer will crash during game play, and I don't exactly have the cash to buy an entire new rig (luckily I might know the problem and am fixing it) but because of  this new ""Millitary Honor"" system, you're ""honor"" stars go down because random players think you're botting, or AFKing when you could have issues like I am experiencing. In my eyes, this system needs a major reworking or removal. And my final and main issue with the game: NO THREE MAN PLATOONS LIKE NORMAL WOTM - I understand that 7 v 7 might be difficult to have 3 man platoons, but we need something cause 2 man platoons is just too small. All I can really say about that. - honestly we should start a petition on WoTB for 3 man platoons for those that agree with this.Another thing for new players is DON'T JUDGE THE GAME UNTIL YOU'RE AT LEAST AT TIER 5, AND THIS GOES FOR WOTM AS WELL. I've seen too many people quit because they don't invest the time into learning this game. It's not just ""point and click and get a kill"" (unless you're an old arty or KV-2, then it sometime is). There is tons of mechanics in the game for armor, a skill called ""sidescraping"", and many other things that will help you survive in battle. Learn you tank too. A Panzer IV will have a completely different playstyle than a T1 Heavy or KV-1 (these are all tier 5s too, so not compairng two diffrent tiers). Use youtube for education and training, and you might enjoy this game more. Note: These are all my opinions, ignore misspellings, etc. And that concludes this long winded review. ",1

15402,War Thunder,2016.0,"So this is going to be my first review of any game on Steam. However I think that people need to know what they are getting into before sinking any time into this as I did.  As a warning this is a long review but there is a lot to go over.First the pros:1.) The different physics models per mode (arcade, realistic, and sim)2.) The wide variety of vehicles3.) beautiful graphics4.) damage models that are not hitpoint bases, i.e. not World of Tanks style5.) intuitive controls.6.) can take multiple vehicles into one battleNow for the cons:1.) The developer does not accept any criticism from the players. Forum posts that are negitive get deleted by mods and you can get your account suspended.2.) the economy is screwed up. The only way to make any decent silver lions (free currency) is to finish in the top three on your team and be running a prem account and several prem vehicles.3.) The matchmaker. War Thunder works on a system they call battle ratings, BR for short. In essence it is a system to reduce the waiting time for a match. Each vehicle has its own battle rating and the different BRs in a given lineup create the combined BR used for matchmaking. Now this all sounds well and good but having even one vehicle of a higher BR in a lineup can put you in very high tier games. Here is an example. I am taking a german air lineup into a match. I have two Bf-109s, two Fw-190s, and a Me-410. Using this lineup will likely get me into a battle with F-82s, Bearcats, and late model Mig fighters. All of these fighters can easily beat my lineup if the enemy pilot is halfway competent, which is likely a given for such high a tier. The same problem comes up with ground forces. M4 Shermans are regularly put up against Tigers and IS series tanks.4.) the damage model. I did put this in the pro section but it also belongs in the cons. This is because it is extreemly easy to one shot vehicles, especially tanks. This is actually the aspect that drove me to stop playing the game. It is a regular occurence to get ammo racked from even the smallest hit to the ammo rack. In order to do well you really need to study all the vehicle models to know where to hit to do the most damage. 5.) the graphics. This is another thing I put in the pro section but also is a con. This is specifically the lowest graphics setting. Despite what the developers have said about fixing the exploit many players still play on the lowest setting to remove a lot of the foliage from the game. This is key in the realistic and simulatior modes because there are no enemy markers to aim at, only direct observation. many times I will be behind a fallen tree or tall hedge and get shot at from the other side of the map. Thanks to the kill cam feature I can see that the shot was not random but aimed correctly and hit the ammo directly. The person who killed me is clearly using the exploit because I was completly behind the concealment and without target markers it should have been impossible for him to see me.6.) the grind. Over the course of my time with WT, not just on steam but also on the direct client from the devs, I have still not unlocked any tier five machines. this is because it literally takes hundrest of thousands of xp to unlock a vehicle and higher than tier three. As I mentioned before the economy is also terrible and makes it hard to buy any vehicles you unlock. A silver lining is that once you buy a vehicle you keep it and do not have to have a individual garage slot to keep it in like in WOT. You also have to unlock other ammunition and the stock is often terrible. There are also no current vehicles that have multiple choices of main weapons, only extra mounts for aircraft. 7.) the playerbase. The community in WT is one of the most toxic ones I have ever encountered. Due to the damage model system almost every kill ends up with the receevign player calling hacks and reporting the other player. I made it a polocy to never enter team chat or general chat.8.) game engine. The game originated with the aircraft component. Therefore the game was developed on a flight sim engine. This made for a wonderful air combat game untill the massive changes to the aforementioned BR and economy. If you are a new player I would suggest you really only play air battles because the physics for ground forces are terrible. Collisions are extreemly common and can lead to huge glitches. For example tanks can get stuck inside each other or get pushed into the gound. Fast tanks can also easliy flip and many heavy tanks use it as a tactic against lighter tanks. Final thoughts. War Thunder started out as a great game but has now devolved into a money maker by the developers. It is possible to advance research on vehicles and even outright buy the upgrade with Golder Eagles, the prem currency. i personally have not spent a dime on this game and I am glad I didn't.My final rating is 2 out of five stars. If you can put up with the grind and want a good MMO flight sim then go right ahead but ignore ground forces and try not to spend money. The developers sometimes have specials for free prem vehicles but they are often extreemly hard to get. As the developer is based in Russia the event times can be sometimes weird and you have to keep watch for them. You will also need a decent comp and large monitor. I do not know if this issue still exists but the Mac client is filled with bugs. I have not used that client in a couple of years so that might be fixed but if trees are not rendering correct with it then it is not your computor but the game itself.",0

Absolutley disappointing. I got that giant battlefield I was wanting. Wide open spaces and fresh air. Until some guy shoots you from half a mile away, that is. Let me tell you something. You have absolutely NO IDEA what helplessness is until you've entered the wrong zone with someone who lives a lightyear away. Seriously. I pull out a rocket launcher (when I was heavy infantry) and shoot the guy in the face. Seems normal, all is cool, yeah? Nah. He whips out a knife and stabs me while I shoot him in the face. That rocket? He ate it. And those ""bullets"" I unloaded into the guy? Never left my barrel I suppose. You'd think that you'd be able to dominate and be ""stealthy"" in this game (was an infiltrator at the time) while all of the other infantry risk their lives for a point. No, not really. There's always that ""one guy"". You should know him. No? How about a brief reminder? He's that one guy who is always looking for you. No matter where you are, he will find you... and murder you. Because one of his friends told him that you don't like his new axe body spray. (and he's super self-conscious)I would love to tell you the story of all my failures, but nobody is gonna wanna read that scidoodle.So, here's a summary: You got GOOD internet? Play. If not? Please, find a garbage can, proceed to stab yourself (not too much, just enough to bleed out in a good few minutes) and throw yourself in the trash.Just think of all the good you'd be doing, for example:I would've gotten to experience the game to it's fullest extent with friends.Along with all those other people you scared away because of your internet's absurd temper.Q/A:Q: I'm a veteran player with 500+ hrs and never experienced this problem.A: I envy you, you little sh- next question!Q: Was it possible that it was your side?A: If it was me, I'd stop playing and find something better to do.

(I can run the game at ULTRA)Q: Who's ""that guy""?A: You're joking right? We JUST went over this.Q: You've only got an hour and a half into the game, why judge it so harshly?A: Game's good, but you might want to have a couple friends. (people I met were awful)Q: Why do you recommend the game despite you not liking it?A: Let's get real, this game is good. If you had not played it yet I suggest you try it when you have the chance. I may not play it for a while, (a long while) but when I get time I'll definitely come back for more when I've got some friends gathered.Q: What would you rate this ?/10?A: 7/10 (opinion may vary through further gameplay)Please, if you are reading this and have yet to play this game.Get some friends.

While the game is a bit tedious at times what with one team being stronger than the other, it's still loads of fun. Even some things that probably shouldn't hapen make this game more enjoyable. If your're sitting at home bored, get this game, call up your friends and make a squadron. You can dominate the battlefield in brute force, tatics, or doing really dumb things like crashing a expensive ship directly into a base and hopping out.

5453,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewDon't even think about playing this game.. Its are crappy game and the only thing the devs want is money.. Why is that you ask? Well try playing it and getting to rank 6, after that good luck because you need to grind for atleast 100+ hours to get something good, plus the devs don't care about the players, they are hiding behind a mask and it might look like they do but they don't.Another BIG issue is the balancing and it is terrible, your team might not have tanks and the enemy team has tanks, the same for planes and everything else.Also this is a pay to win game, Why? Well because the money you are earning is not near enough to buy anything, you get like 3k per game and the basic meele weapon is 15k, not to mention the sniper rifle which is about 250k so you will have to but gold with real money and spend it, if it was only for the looks it was ok but it isn't, you pay for guns, rifle, lmg and basicly... everything, the only thing that you don't have to pay for is the civilian car and bike that spawn near points, you even have to pay for repairing your weapon and buy ammo. Plus you have 3 factions and the items that you buy doesn't share between the factions... and if you look at the reviews and the rating you'll see that its probably droping because people are starting to realize that this is a pay to win game with a lot of bugs and doesn't worth your time and your money.",0
1926,theHunter Classic,2016.0,Ok so after a few hours playing this game i can honestly say i really liked it. The negative reviews are people crying because they expect something for nothing. This is F2P i have been for some time now. Every week the animals you can hunt are rotated you also start with two guns and five types of ammo which can deal with most of the creatures. Yes there is a lot of things to buy in the game but you are not being forced to and you earn in game money for your kills. My personal advice would be to get a 12 month mebership which i think is £30 and with that you get so much extra stuff plus the right to hunt what ever you like. So if your into your hunting give it a try and see for yourself.,1

I think this stems from the flawed idea that every game should be smash bros. while Brawlhalla does mimic it in many ways, I think that a lot of the differences are what gives brawlhalla a little kick. half the fun of this game is aerial battles and throwing bombs at your friends, which the mechanics allow a lot of.",1

16349,Magic Duels,2016.0,"A good way to learn the game, and play some casual games.Awful booster pack system forcing you to create singleton decks with basic playsets only availible through the crappy starter sets (despite your AI opponents having full access to playsets). A very subpar deck building interface that would benefit from viewing cards as a list, and adding more filter options.Some very frustrating rulings, especially when it comes to instants and abilities. There is no seperate timer before your enemy's combat phase in SP, and I have not been able to activate abilities on a tapped creature, even when the ability does not require tapping or mana.The interface also suffers greatly. Your decks should be accessible from the main menu, and from the booster pack opening screen. And why is the ""Skip Attack"" button on the top? You know, the button that immediately skips combat (with potentially game-losing consequences), instead of the one that gives you a chance to back out. If I didn't have a durable headset, it would surely be broken by now. Even with my hours of play, I still occasisonaly, accidentially hit the skip attack button in especially tense games, or when I'm playing after work, and I'm tired.It barely makes it as a recommendation, if only because it's a good resource for new and potential players, beign ""free"" and all (it gets boring pretty fast without boosters and deck building, after the story games).Once you learn, move on to paper Magic (recommended) or Magic Online to avoid the unending frustration Duels throws at you. The only reason I continue to play is for the AI opponents. Great for a quickie or two when none of my friends are availible. Unfortunately, my patience is beginning to thin, quite a bit, as I feel the money I spent on it ($40) didn't offer me greater enjoyment. I'd rather buy paper Magic, or just buy a different game for entertainment, at that price.You can earn boosters, but it takes forever just to get enough coins for one after the story games. You have to win TEN games on HARD, to get ONE booster. Even then, it's only six cards. Good luck getting playsets, of even commons, at that rate.By the way, the only reason I even started a review, is because it ♥♥♥♥in' spams you after every goddamn game for a review. If this game wasn't initially free, even if it cost $1, I would have put 'No'.---TL;DRGood for learning, little value in long-term play. Buying the six-card booster packs adds little to nothing, in terms of enjoyment. They take a very long time to earn after the story missions. After the stories, the fun quickly wanes. Frustrating interface both for play and deck building.I cannot recommend spending money on boosters for it. The money-to-fun ratio is zilch. Play the stories for free, spend your cash on paper Magic at your local game store (or on MO, if your a doomsday prepper living in the mountains with minimal access to civilization).",1

I came back one day and I played Diana. 49 levels in Diana later, I've been pretty much enamored with the game.

Imagine this, in my few hours of playing I had to create 8 different characters in 3 of the servers just to try and progress the quest. Why you ask? Because apparently, unlike other MMOs where the worst bug/glitch that could happen is crash to desktop, Tree of Savior being the highly innovative and ground breaking MMO that it is, makes your chars get stuck in perpetual limbo. I'm serious. Playing your guy, enter a MAIN CLASS TRAINER home for A MAIN STORY QUEST, gets kicked to the server list with a error message showing up for a fraction of a second and then BAM! that character cannot be played again. Yup.Only ways to fix it is..raise a ticket in their support and wait for something to happen. After a day, they responded that they moved my first char to starting city. Ok good, skipped the quest (which again I mention, is a MAIN QUEST) and entered the next map on the list AND IT HAPPENS AGAIN. Raised a ticket, made other several chars, same issue. Go to map, get slapped with error and then char becomes unplayable. I have 8 different characters in 3 different servers stuck in various dimensions of purgatory and I'm at a loss. It's seldom an MMO is this badly made. Sure, MMOs get grindy or boring or hit a pay to win wall..... But for an MMO to be an unplayable mess is quite something else.Such a shame though, as a guy whose first MMO was Ragnarok Online, I was really excited to play its spiritual successor.

14206,War Thunder,2013.0,"Well the game is turning quickly into a money sink scam. They are even banning anyone who points this out on their forums and here in steam forums. Ive been a steam member since the early days and never seen this behavior before. Don't kid yourselves, this game is turning into a massive P2W game. The game is fun in AB, but the biases are so obvious its almost shameful. The new patch was nothing more than a massive attempt to get people to spend more cash or you will have to grind forever and ever. If you don't have hundreds of dollars to throw away to be competitive, then get used to the idea that you will be fodder for the rest. Overall the game is good, but the company running it are on par with hedge fund managers. Buyer beware.",0
4973,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewBless online looks incredible at first glance, but like a new car bought off craigs list the problems quickly come into view.   The engine simply doesnt work, FPS drops are consistent even on a pc that can run BDO on 60 fps consistently, the UI freezes your computer consistently for small spurts for no reason, the windshields literally 5 inches from your face and trying to adjust it simply launches it into the stratosphere, and finally the game itself freezes like its going to win something.  Now this can be forgiven as the game is in early access and as such can easily be fixed.  Lack of optimization is not neccessarily a bad thing and shouldnt affect ones purchase, however with this game having been released previously it doesnt really scream GOOD THINGS at you while you play.Bless online has some of the easiest leveling in the game, which is one of the only things I am pleasantly surprised by.  Most games with enchanting systems like bless have long slogs of leveling and enchanting to keep people around for years (im looking at you BDO) simply because they lack content.  Bless seems to have corrected this issue.  It is altogether possible to hit level 30 in around 10-14 hours while running dungeons and while it is boring it isnt neccessarily difficult.  The problem with this is that the game is so boring you may never want to find out what combat or pvp is present at endgame and if you are lucky enough to not crash every 30 minutes you might even get that chance.TLDR:  Bless offline is a brilliant tool to train patience with, if you enjoy staring at a login screen for hours and crashing constantly give it a try.  Also I enjoyed it 10/10 would play again...after its fixed.... in 2 years",0

1163,Sakura Clicker,2015.0," Note: This is going to be a 'serious' review Normally I like Sakura games. They're fun perverted visual novels with absolutely Ludacris plots, dialogue, and situations that scream fan service with copious amounts of anime boobs, butts, and the occasional tentacle monster or two. However Sakura Clicker is anything but that. Yes, it does have Anime girls(dressed as animals and Ancient Egyptian gods for some reason - so I guess if you get off to Anubis or Osiris this is the game for you) but that's really it. You click on those Animal/Egyptian god Anime girls to do damage while your character stands awkwardly to the right and watches you. Each Animal/Egyptian God Anime Girl you defeat drops gold which you can use to hire Hero's to help you or upgrade stats and that's basically it. All you end up doing is basically click as hard as you possibly can until your wrist feels like it's about to implode and ending up on the next monster. The game is a never-ending grind fest of just doing that over and over again while facing the same 5ish Animal/Egyptian God anime girls over and over again. So why this game was made you ask? ""Oh it can't be that bad, it's free right?” One answer: To sell DLC outfits to thirsty guys that makes your character that stands to the right be wearing a bra made out of a ribbon or something. PROS It's freeThe girls moan when you click themI guess this game could finally quench someone’s thirst who has an ancient Egyptian God fetish CONS Pretty obvious the game was made to sell DLCDLC is overpriced (for a dollar it doesn't even change how the monsters look - just the outfit of your character who stands to the left and creepily watches you play this game)Grind fest Conclusion Skip over this one. If you really want to play a Sakura game, check any of the other Visual Novel ones out or wait for Sakura Fantasy Chapter 2. ",0

1987,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewHello all this is my opinion of the game. Take what i say into consideration before purchasing this game. Week 1- Major issues was happening not anything new to a new MMO launch. Fixed pretty quick to say the least apart from other MMO's i have played.Week 2- Was ok i believe pvp started up got to experience it and wasnt bad but some classes were op and considering this game is focused on pvp. It didnt meet alot of players expectations but pvp is hard to balance but pvp was the only end game there.Week 3-4- Devs kicked half if not all emissarys some deserved to be kicked and some didnt. Emissarys are post to give feedback Positive or Negative, if the dev team cant communicate to emissarys then why even develop a huge potential game and very profitable if it was executed right. Gameplay- I thought the gameplay was smooth although huge fps problems for alot of people including me i felt optimization could of been better for a Early Access game that was mostly done just a few minor fixes here and there but that was not the case.Combat- Was ok kinda felt clunky even switching stances felt clunky to me. Combat was a slow/fast pace mix when using skills but overall pretty fun.Taming- Brillant idea that i hate to see go to waste loved this aspect of the game. You could capture anything just about in the game. Hope to see other mmos use this idea but make it even better although idk how you could make it even better haha. Crafting- It was simple i liked that not really into lifeskills that much Dungeons- Were pretty difficult after a few patches but the loot was meh even for the last dungeon.This game failed because of poor communication from devs, youtubers who only play to lvl 20, and so forth. But i can not recommend this game in its current state. I hope to see it bounce back but i highly doubt it. Took to big of a hit.",0

5572,Dota 2,2013.0,"I played over 3000+ hours of Dota 2 as of right now. While playing this game I have been called the worst profanities that one could imagine, I have been tormented by loss and betrayal, I have dealt with the worst human beings this world has to offer, I have cried, suffered and lost my sanity at the hands of this game and yet I still keep playing... I definitely recommend :3",1
10746,Dreadnought,2018.0,"This game is now infested with corvettes which are supposed to be hit-and-run ships and general harrassers that tankier than the tanks of the game.This game is now infested with ramcans that disable entire teams in a single sweep with zero penalty to their obliviousness, amplified by the number of the same oblivious ramcans with zero penalty.This game is now infested with an absolute necessesity for a dictated ""meta"" loadouts if you want anything done, ever.Save your time and energy elsewhere.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Having been in this ride called Dreadnought since its earliest Alphas, a long running supporter of it, I can definetly, without a question say the game is nothing related to World Of Warships nor it has Anything to do with ""muh moba"".Dreadnought is first and foremost a team based, role dependant Third Person Shooter, that allows a great deal of hybridization of classes. This does not mean that the 5 ship types deviate from their inteded fields, but that the available upgrades, modules and passives will enable every ship to perform hole plugging and support tasks in one way or another, without overreaching out of their respecitve roles.Gameplay-wise the game does not offer anything ground breaking or revolutionary, but it repacks a good 'ole TPS into goergous settings and lets you loose on awesome spacecrafts. General speed and pace is on the slow side, but that only adds to sheer mass these vessels possess.Audiovisuals in general have lots of quirks every Sci-Fi fanatic appreciates. All the modules are animated and it's every time a pleasure to see broadsides firing, missile bays and batteries opening up and deploying the payloads or to see your ship recoil from the firing of high power catapults. Not to mention your Tactical- and Weapons Officers are constantly talking to you about target lock ons, module usage, shield status, you name it. Really driving home the impression you ARE the Captain.Dreadnought is also one of those rare few Free To Play games where the advertised ""NO PTW"" is actually true. Nothing in the store offers you anything over your opponents beside a nice suit and a cap. One might argue Hero Ships fill this role, and maybe so given their income bonus, but then again, they all have god aweful locked loadouts it's not either worth using them, or then you need to know what you're doing. Balances that bonus out.On the downsides of the game I'd say after Tier 3 the progression grind starts to become a chore as at that point the player has practically seen everything the game has to offer, only tougher matches in higher tiers against seasoned players after that. And that Corvettes have most of the modules in the category ""absolute cancer"".Great Third Person team Shooter with very little real problems, and nothing that is beyond repair or salvage, other than retainable player base. I myself have ""quit"" the game 3 times now!",0
9331,Creativerse,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewWhat seems like 'Another Minecraft Clone' quickly shows how much of it's own beast it truly is. Don't get me wrong, with its voxel based terrain and building mechanisms, it wears it's influences firmly on it's sleeve. But Creativerse has carved it's own brilliant niche in the survival/creative genre.It's extending building system, wiring system, advanced crafting, adventures and multiplayer ease all put it a step above the 'big guy' in the genre, and it's character modelling, music and lighting all go towards creating a truly characterful and inviting game space.It's free-to-play model is weighted perfectly, microtransactions are available for 'premium' blocks, but the core game is completely unhindered by any 'pay walls'... they have the balance perfect.A fantastically fun, characterful and in depth survival creative game. Not to be missed!",1
9338,Magic Duels,2015.0,"I tried to like this game, but I cant.All of the criticisms are well founded.One awful aspect is just how many times you can run out of lands in this game, even when over 1/3 of your hands are lands.

15697,Creativerse,2018.0,"I've played this game for a while now, i think about 20 hours at this point? On different worlds (my world, my friend's private world, and a public world). I haven't even fully explored everything in the game yet (though, I do have a good understanding of the game imo lol). And I'd say this is a pretty good free to play alternative to another well known block mining game *cough minecraft cough*. Pros:free to playlots to do addicting, easy to spend hours in a single session playing and losing track of timelet's you be very creative (the name says it all lol)can play with friendshuge worlds to explorecons:sonetimes theres lag when moving (or maybe thats just my bad computer lol). It doesn't really take away from the game imo, but its noticeableYou have to pay for the pro version for certain features (I especially want this for the flashlight bc im terrified of the dark mines), however, these features aren't nescessary for the game and you can play the game entirely without it. But, if you're a free to play player, you can't make a new world, this means you can only play in your starter world, a friend's world, or a public world. I kind of wish f2p players could at least make one more world, but if you want to create another world for whatever reason, you need to buy the pro version, however its a one time payment and its not too terribly expensive, so its not that bad.my rating:7/10",1

5815,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017.0,"Well you're down here looking at reviews so either you're looking for a laugh, looking for someone who agrees with you, or are legitimately deaf to the social world and need this second opinion. If you're gonna read this just know this isn't written completely out of spite, it's just my way of rationalizing how such a decent game can cultivate one of the most horrifyingly sadistic and brutally toxic communities I have ever seen in my 18+ years of gaming.Well, here we go...If you value your time, self-esteem or general sanity, I advise you stay as far away from competitive as possible. Stop. Don't bother. Save yourself the heart condition and stick to casual. Or don't play at all, that would be the optimal choice. This game is a test of character, not just a test of skill, and I will tell you why.This game splits everyone into one of 3 categories of player, the one who is bad at playing but can learn and improve, the expert player who harrasses and belittles all others for not being good enough, and the trash players who votekicks and teamkills reguardless of target or skill. This, of course, is nothing new and is pretty common in all online multiplayer games. The harshness of this game, however startlingly eclipses all other communities I have ever seen, creating a sinkhole of reason and leaving everyone with pure hatred not only for the opposite team, but every single person on their own team.You see, like the snake that consumes it's tail, all players that stick with this game end up reaching the second archetype, who in turn become the harrassers after all the hostility they put up with. They go and become the average player in the game, maybe a youtuber, who baits others into trying the game and constantly filling the quota of targets to harrass and belittle. It's a self sustained cycle that has slowly ramped up since the game first came out in 2012, which I can attest as I have been here since the beginning (my hour count doesn't reflect this, so it doesn't relate).That's not to say this is a bad game, no no no. It's just that the entirety of the community is toxic and spiteful, with about 3/4 of them (a generous measurement I'm sure) that WILL sour the game for you. On the other hand if you somehow fit into this description, then by all means try your luck. I promise you your newly found anger management disorder will find a perfect home in your life.If you've made it this far you're either intrigued by what I've said thus far, or you are skipping to the end to see my point. Well either way here it is:If you really want to play this, whether it's for a friend or personal interest, stick to the casual and more open game modes, otherwise I guarantee that you will not like the outcome. Even if you do decide you like it, you will reach a point where you reassess what you've experienced, the community you've exp[osed yourself to, and eventually decide whether you want to put up with this anymore. It'll be your loss, but also your lesson.",0
999,Realm Royale,2018.0,Early Access Review1st. This game gets 10 thumbs up from me!!!! The gameplay is great and so are the graphics very very smooth! I havent had any lag or glitchs except for chars running around with their arms spread out [once in a great while]. The people commenting that its a remake of fortnite have issues with their brains... This game is NOTHING like fortnite..... Fortnite doesnt even have a mount system {except for the fail A$$ jetpack}/classes/Forging/Special abilities..... And crying about the team play only and no solo...... Get a life and some friends.....{wine A$$es}....  It's not hard too hop into a game and meet someone with a mic..... And it also makes this game different then ALL the others for NOT having solo..... But yet ALOT are saying its a remake LOL.... {Low IQ I suppose or just need something too cry over} I have a high end pc so I can't say how it will work on low spec pc but with 5.5ghz and 1080TI 32gigs Ram game runs smooth as silk!!! Finally a BR that has something different then all the others the forging and abilities really make it for me!!! Its not just run around and kill till the end if you and your partner dont take the time too farm materials and forge all your gear and weapons you can kiss your A$$ goodbye when it comes down too the last few teams cuz the regular guns and armor wont get you anywere vs peeps that forged and took the time too farm materials!! Which is EXACTLY why this game is NOTHING like ANY other BRs!! Give this game a try you have nothing too lose and alot too gain if you like it xD,1

14459,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewHello Steam community it great to meet you all, thank you for taking the time to gaze at my review. Frist off, I start by saying after playing well over 668.0 hours of Robocraft, I come to a turning point. the crativity that once made the game enjoyable has become sadly ended in my own option.  no more will you see duck or boat, or even cute anime robots. the choice to jump on to a loot based game system left a bad taste.I really try to embrace the new changes.  but time and time agian the move to a a more competitive tournaments style of gaming to me rune the beauty the game once had.I really do love the the ideal the game give, i love to be ceative. building a robots in robocraft was once rewarding, i use to enjoy battleing and come across someone who would creative with there own robots battle mine, notice funny than seeing a  hat waring duck battle a big piggy, but you dont see anything like that now.Most matches are now all competitive tournament robot are build for only one idea to win loot crates to get the best weapons & armor.when I was at about 500hrs into robocraft I started to notice the change. but the last few changes I hope things would return to a playable game, but sadly the introduction to loot crate, have only reward people who have enough spare time and money to buy them, it make the game feel cheep. feel like a cash grabing tactic in my own opinion.If you new player, you're robots are only going ot be meat for the higher level players with the best weapons and armor. but that being siad.  the game still offer enjoyable gaming for competitive players. but if you just want to be creative player then sady this is not the game for some people.Talking aobut what i liked and dislike about the game has all change.  becuase this is not the same game i played when i frist started playing robocraft,  with before there tier system you had balance, with the exponential scale in Robocraft that determines how strong a robot was, and what other robots it could battle, but now with the matches base on cpu  favior poeple who buy loot crates to who then make lower cpu robots with extramly powerful weapons witch then in my opion then rune experince.I also sadly if you had ask me  a year ago to recommend the game i would have, but becuase of overtiering and introduction to Loot crates system, having to pay primum monthly jsut for extra pant colors, really under vaule the game. so with a vary heavy hart i must sadlly un-recomend this game to anyone who  think the game offer crativty and fun enjoyable gamming. and only  .....*sighs*..... recomment this  for people who are competitive tournament player types.",0
13038,Neverwinter,2014.0,"A F2P game with some elements of nickle and diming but they're avoidable. It's totally playable without putting a cent into it but you're restricted to two characters. There's no restrictions on the gameplay itself and it's quick to level to 60.     Resetting your character's active skills costs ""Zen"" which is real money, but you shouldn't have to unless you've been playing level 60 for a while. Resetting passive skills called ""Feats"" cost ingame currency called ""Astral Diamonds"" and it scales depending on how much points you put into it already. Astral diamonds can be traded for Zen and vise versa to help cover costs for an extra character or a skill reset if you're worried about spending real money, but it takes time to collect enough of.    Unfortunately, the economy is somewhat bloated with bot farmers selling ingame currency for real money, causing some items on the market to be ungodly amount of astral diamonds to buy. Finding a party to get into a dungeon is almost impossible unless you advertise yourself on the ""Looking For Group"" chat or bring friends. One of the classes, The Devoted Cleric, has a high difficulty curve that can surprise new players and is not recommended to play during your first time unless you know what you're in for. There's also balance issues with enchantments and high level pvp which the developers said to be patched soon.     All in all, decent free MMO that if you don't have problems with gambling (see TF2 or CS:GO i.e crates), should really only cost you none to 15 USD. Surpisingly fun and the classes feel great and powerful to play. It's recommended, if it is your first time, to just play the game however you want without worrying what build you should spec into.",1

Alot funner then you might think, so ya I recommend this game as it has HUGE growth potential. 2v2 player maps 3v3 player maps, different space areneas to fight in, weapons upgrades and whats with that first video? I would love to be able to go in my cockpit. The growth is there so keep it up guys. Also read alot of reviews about it not connecting to people?

16545,Path of Exile,2015.0,"This game is one of the worst ARPGs out here.Non challenging and easy gameplay? Check.Massive and unreasonable difficulty spikes? Check.Being one shotted regardless of your build sometimes by single attacks or by literally aoes who take up entire maps? Check.Uninspired and meaningless quests? Check.Bland environments? Check.Outdated and primitive game systems? Check.As you can see this game has a lot of problems. From meaningless and useless loot which is so common that it will act as a hazzard in actual combat to never receiving anything good. In 30 hours of my gameplay as a Witch, I had received like 10 unique items at least and non were useful for me. Maps were the worst. They are like mazes filled with unchallenging enemies those only purpose is to delay you. System existing in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Skills coming from items means that you have sea of gems to sort through and to collect even to build hero which you would like. Without literally getting to know every ability in a game, you cannot start your build in a first place. AI could be done better by university's students. Mobs can only attack in straight lines, they lock on the first target which often ends up in a fragile heroes being one shotted. If you play as necromancer, you are in a whole of pain when boss will lock up on you and you will be forced to dodge and run and your spectres and  zombies will run with you. Only skeletons were smart enough to fight reliably enemies. I also got corrupted skeleton summon and the whole game became ""if I can summon my army at the right time"" I win kind of a game. Who could had guessed that summoning literally 40+ skeletons at the time would insta shot some bosses when combined with buffs and sacrifices. Then there are other bosses where you cannot raise corpses and their massive aoe will melt through your summons. Fights are not at all playtested and there isn't any class balance. Some classes are plainly unplayable.Game loves to permamently debuff you, no joke. Your reward for finishing the campaign is that you will be denied picking boss loot as you are instantly teleported out and your stats are forever reduced for your achievements. You are not given decent resist gear and are literally drown in special abilities who can instan shot you. The worst thing is that you take bonus damage from those abilities as negative values are simply immense and it requires overpowered end game gear to even be competitive. Veterans had long forgotten at how terrible this game is with their twink speed leveling.As for story, it is the worst one I had ever encountered. Developers think that simply creating a lot of made up stuff makes them good story tellers. So we no have Japanese level nonsense where main characters are names as: Piety, Sin, Innocence. Where empires are names as: Eternal Empire. This utter nonsense and disregard for the lore makes everything pointless. For example in chapter 2 I literraly on accident had stolen the light of a day. Literally. Then I fought an easy boss and brought back the light...The very next quest was to find lost lover of some worthless chick. Questing and story telling is nonsensical as that. At one hand you are murdering Gods, at other you are doing lowly errands for random fools. Characters are even worse, outside of their tendency to spout walls of meaningless text at you, some of them are so painfully generic and gamey. For example, there is a NPC who is all about the maps. So her voiced dialogue literally is like this: ""Keep your maps safe"". ""Take care of your maps"". Really, how I'm to believe it is a real world with its own story when every person in it is so damn artificial? Things just happen. Your enemies become your friends, because literally they decide they are now good guys. Bad guys impede and fight you just because. I never seen any other game where they would put so much effort into a story and it would emerge so painfully bad. Like every cliche and most horrible writting practices kind of bad. For being this bad you need a talent which is equally rare as being just better writer than anyone else.As for items, you will never get  any. They mostly look horrible and they never drop anything good. My core set was found at act 2 which I never really replaced since. You will look terrible, your will be bombarded with loot, but never ever you are going to get anything useful. Small inventory space, meaningless RNG grinding, massive time wastes. It is MMORPG for ARPG fans who enjoy mindlessly wasting their time and grinding nonsense, putting on with unintuitive and obscure character building systems and want to pretend being veterans and better than others just by sheer virtue of time sink and getting their heads around of poorly made and highly unintuitive systems.",0
2448,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"I've only played a short while so far, but what I can say thus far is that - if you can put up with occasionally over-the-top and edgy artwork - the gameplay is solid and actually has some very interesting and new mechanical ideas, viz. the evolve mechanics which allow you to (generally) empower a creature and the Storm ability (think MtG Haste) versus Rush (Haste but only able to attack creatures, aka ""followers"" - this ability is also given by evolve). The result of these mechanics is a healthy amount of counterplay options, versus say Hearthstone and its numerous competitors. Another of the strongest aspects of this game is the relative generosity of the publisher: 10 free packs for every previous expansion and 10 free packs of the new one upon release. With login rewards of gold currency and card pack tickets in addition to daily quests that provide much the same, at no point have I felt at a complete disadvantage, even at only 4 hours in.As to the meta, I can't speak much to that because of my relative lack of experience. However, I began playing this in the previous, much-bemoaned patch and have played some with the new one and I will tentatively say that I have seen a greater variety of decks already.Considering these various aspects, it's worth a try if you're into virtual CCGs, I think. Cheers, all!",1

12813,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2016.0,"Multiplayer contains alot of trolls with no admins to get arid of them and im a big fan of multiplayer when It comes to online games. But for this game, you get at least a couple trolls here and there in a server. They often like to ram you off the track or use their car to block part of the track. Drivers like me would rather roleplay and play the game the professional way. It only takes one troll to ruin the server gameplay and there is no body to take care of the issue. If trolls were not such a big problem, I would recommend this game, but I don't. Just about ready to uninstall this game if multiplayer doesn't get any better.",0

875,Neverwinter,2014.0,"For a MMORPG Neverwinter looks great and sounds good... The combat system is easy to learn and the quests seem good and fun so far. Allmost all npc:s have voice acted dialogues. Graphics are great and very detailed. The world seem alive and full of players. There is a lot of different cool looking monsters and enemys. Your given a lot of different choises to make..You need to choose your race and class carefully..Most of the skill sets/kits give you the opportunity to do some additional exploration, like opening hidden doors and scavenging resources/spotting traps.For the F2P part I havent seen anything you would ""need"" to pay real money for yet. All is seemingly achievable by playing and spending your in game resources.If you are in a hurry I can imagine you need to pay to win.And Im not in a hurry :) Iw been playing Neverwinter with a friend and the need/greed/pass system seems to work just fine. It also seems like some of the loot is shared by all players so we both get to loot the same chests* and so on(*note that not all loot is shared).  I found myself skipping some of the sidequest dialogue because its not allways very good. Sometimes the npc:s are a bit boring and just seem to stare with glass stale eyes (warmly affectionate eye contact;)And I also had some connection issues with the servers from time to time.All together a positive experience so far.If u like MMORPG:s you might really like this too.",1
5001,Aura Kingdom,2015.0,"I've not played it for long, but here is my opinion:Apart from the UI which I found annoying, the game is standard quality.

13369,Creativerse,,"game is just good. No more or less. The survival aspect of the game (killing monsters, buffing your character ) is fine and well made so it doesn't bother you in any way or is too agressive. A lot of mobs to kill and be killed by makes the world like it's living and not just "" hey you are here, build and nothing else awaits "" and i like that. But there should be more boss like creatures which you can't tame but killing them grants you armour, weapons and stuff. I know that Golden keepa and the Thing are such creatures but i think the game needs more like in early stages of the game. The quest system is 10/10 right now, i love the idea and it fits the game perfectly. It's good to have a way to get coins and grab some skins from the store just by playing and completing the quests.Bulding system is the core of the game. Devs should focus on it more than on other stuff, like realy focus focus. Add more wiring stuff, so player could create automatic Farms, forges, proccessors or storage system that will sort everything and do when the player can do something else in a meantime. This is the only thing the game is missing ( in bulding category ofcourse ).I think the problem with creativerse is the Free to play system. Devs look at Minecraft, 30$ for a game similar to yours and you can do everything in there. Make use of bugs, exploits, mods and more. Not like here where copying block with phasers or auto replanting system where deleted just because some players copied premium blocks which normally you can't get unless you pay. The patch doing so was almost a year ago and you guys didn't come up with anyithnig to replace it. Such things pis.ses players off. stop focusing on money and start respect players more. Because when you loose them money will go away. I don't know how this is gonna be solved by you devs, make the game Pay To Play or make Pro version more attractive and stop thinkig like this game was made for you to make money. Think about like a gift for others and money will come.For now i leave a negative review. START THINKING DEVS OR YOU WILL GO DOWN LIKE BETHESDA AFTER FALLOUT 76. ",0

13633,Trove,2016.0,"I loved this game for a while. It was a grind for power and items, but it was fun enough to keep me around. You could pay money to shorten the grind or to make your character look special, but it has always been too much money for what you get IMO and you could get by without spending.Recently they've made the grind infinitely long to achieve most goals, and they've moved some items behind the paywall. But their prices remain too high. So you basically have to dump a bunch of money into it to get anywhere, or you grind toward fewer goals that now have no end in sight.They took a big step in the P2W direction. I understand that they are trying to make money, and it's their right, but I'm positive they would've made more and lost fewer players by going about it differently.",0

15725,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"I keep saying I don't like games like this, I keep saying how 'card games' are not my ''thing'' and yet certain ones will come around and disprove me, they'll lull me in and a few hours later I am hoooked, and this is one of those games.I've played 2 hours of Elder Scrolls: Legends so far so my review isn't a review of the entrire game as such but more an impression of the game after giving it what I feel is ample time to get a idea of what the game is about.  The battles themself are a mix of really easy and really bloody hard, and so tactics play a big part of card selection, attacking, defending and buffing your cards to inflict damage but also to keep the enemies away from you.  I struggled with this taking 5 attempts to do the early Wolves battle but as sh arp as I felt the learning curve was it made me want to beat it to stick the middle finger up at it and say 'there i beat you MF'er' and I suppose ultimately that is what you want, a game that is not too easy or two hard but requires you to think a little more tactically each time you face an opponent.I did see that there was DLC, for a free game it's not really an issue as there's plenty to keep you occupied and to be unlocked if you are willing to put the time and effort into playing it although I can understand if some want to save time or simply have to have everything at their disposal to play with.Overall a great game and would recommend people at least try it once.",1

13687,Magic Duels,2016.0,"Product received for freeI tried to play Magic Online and I told them during the registration process that it had been a while since I'd played, so I got shunted off to this game instead of being allowed to download the actual Magic Online.  Apparently I'm not good enough for the real game, you know, the one where there's no animations, a terrible UI consisting of separate windows popped out for weird things, minimal sound, and zero explanation as to what's happening as you mash your way through interrupt opportunities via the tiny OK button off to the left.No, instead I'm forced into the Retard Corral of Magic Duels, with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rock-sounding OST, minimal animations without any sense of impact or importance to them, minimal sound (though slightly less minimal than MtGO), and a plethora of features designed to make me feel as though the game itself is calling me stupid for playing it.  Is it the mandatory pause of 2-3 seconds between each phase?  Is it the narrator who reads verbatim all the help text, that pops up explaining things like the concept of what a ""turn"" is, at a rate of about 1 word every 2 seconds?  Is it the insultingly easy ""challenging and fun skill quests""?  Is it the way all the cards zoom up to the screen when played so I can take my sweet time in seeing that yes, this is another of the same 2/2 with no abilities?  Or is it the way the game directs me to follow the glowing sparkles on the menu to go through its deeply stupid story about some kid who is a thief but he has HONOR and he WALKS a PLANES before I'm allowed to actually, you know, make a deck and duel someone with it?I got so fed up with all this that I actually gave Magic Online another shot, managed to stumble my way through enough of the terrible ♥♥♥♥ing interface to finish an actual game, decided hey yeah I'm gonna register an account, then!

I find its name ironic because it lacks SOUL.I wanted so desperately for this game to succeed, and I was willing to put up with a lot.

19980,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"P2W vs Hearthstone: Either very (generous / heinous). Booster packs are somewhat 'fair', with rates for each card revealed officially. Many bronze/silver tier cards are viable. However there are 2~3 really powerful class legendaries that you (want to / have to) stuff the deck with full three copies for serious jump in win rates - Game allows you to buy the same starter deck three times for that reason more or less.Gameplay: Some matchups can be very stagnant. They do their own thing, you do yours, and maybe once every three turns Haven and Rune will react to your turn. Hell, if the game let them do it, I'm sure they'd throw single target removals against an empty board out of force of habit. Aggro Swordcraft floods the board every turn and doesn't care how you deal with it, but at least there is a war of attrition to be fought there. In the end everything is balanced because everything is OP, sort of. Except poor fairies, combo system isn't friendly to them yet.Audiovisual: You're playing this instead of Hearthstone because of dem waifus. Illustrations are large enough to appreciate them as CCGs tend to be.Overall: Nice distraction, probably worth investing a few starter decks, good fun being in the middle of the pack playing suboptimal decks, but the climb to top isn't appealing.",1
7363,EverQuest II,2011.0,"When I frist started playing Everquest 2 it was amazing (its still great). The players were friendly and mature, there were lots of things to do (still is) but now days groups are tough to come by because of the population decline about a year ago (update 6/2/2018: population problems seem to have been evened out due to server merges). The shadow oddesy was the prime of everquest 2 (iMO). I suggest playing this, many people have made life long friends and even gotten married IRL because of this game. I still have so many great memories from people I played this with, but, bridges have been burned and I cant relive them, so I have to make new ones. It's so sad for me to see so many people I used to play with leave for other mmo's and never return. The best time of my gaming life was when I was playing my main (at the time) on the everfrost server (merged with another server so it isnt call that anymore) in a guild called Stormsurge. This is a game where you have to be respectul of other players because there arent millions of people loggin on every day like FF14 or ESO. You unknowingly begin making a name for yourself when you begin playing.Get this game. Maybe you can have great memories like I do. Everquest is an mmorpg unlike any other, unriveled in its content. Update 6/2/2018: I have been playing EQ2 for 10 years. The only reason steam says i have less than 300 hours is because it hasnt been on steam for the full duration of it's release. So if I had to guess i'd say I have around 3000 - 4000 hours on Everquest 2.My main is called Scuttlebutt and he is on the Antonia bayle server. Hit me up if you want to play.",1

9480,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewLet's get right into it. Why does another Battle Ground need to exist? Well lets talk about what makes this game different than its popular competitors-Choose your class (warrior, assassin, engineer, mage, or hunter) all have special abilities, weapons, and passives (no healer but there is some support builds that warriors and engineers can go for).-Ride a horse mount to ride through zones when outside.-Disenchant obsolite items to create materials to craft legendary armor, weapons, abilities and potions.-Look for forge smoke to spot enemies who are crafting, swoop in, eliminate them and steal the legenday loot-When your HP reaches zero, you are polymorphed into a chicken, survive as a chicken for 30 seconds and you will revive. If you die as a chicken or get polymorphed 3 times and you are eliminated.This is a simplified explaination, but there is a lot more I could ramble on about, but honestly you should just get in and give it a try.  The game is very early access and needs to be polished but plays well and the game is being updated and improved very rapidly.P.S.It's amazing how people over react to a bad patch. Yes, this latest patch has its flaws, but it solved a LOT of other issues with the game. Most people read the patch notes and immediately freaked out. Most of these bad reviews come from that drama.

The publishers. ♥♥♥♥ing 3 hours for 10%exp life destroying grinds. What the actual ♥♥♥♥.2 years later and most of these problems have been resolved.

57,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"For a F2P FPS MMO game, PlanetSide 2 hits the nail right on the head. It is essentially TF2 except on a MASSIVE scale (when I say massive I mean massive. Think of a map as big as a free roam RPG.) with vehicles, more players and endless fun. I never played the original, but this would probably be better. It is also a first person shooter.It is a hard thing to review PlanetSide 2. There is just so much content. We'll star with the good:The Good:The map size is massive! A whole continent. And not just one continent. THREE! With another one releasin in April 2014. Every inch of the map is accessible if you have the right equipment. From the sweeping planes, mountains and desert of Indar, to the barren and snow swept continent of Esamir, with its huge craggy purple things and plains of snow, to the lush forest of Amerish, with its trees, grass and mountains. There are three different factions to choose from: The glorious Terran Republic (my personal favourite), the xeno-tech worshiping turds of the Vanu Soverignty, the rebels dogs of the New Conglomerate. If you want more about each of the factions, here is a link: http://au.ign.com/wikis/planetside-2/Factions There are five classes to chose from in PlanetSide 2: The Infiltrator who handles sniping and sneaking. The Light Assault who flies around the battlefield with his jetpack. The Heavy Assault who just shoots stuff with a HUGE amount of ammo and has heavy armour. The Combat Medic. He (or she doesn't matter) heals allies and shoots stuff if they get in his way. The Engineer who repairs vehicles, sports the same weapons of the Light Assault. There is one last thing I have to mention on the classes: The Max! This is just a smaller mech. he has two mounted weapons, huge amounts of health and a high kill rate. Engineers heal him and Medics revive him.The amount of players. You need lots of people to fill up a large map right? Well here we have hunrdreds of players PER SIDE! And if you are lucky enough you may get a three-way battle.Finally, the vehicles. You can use vehicles like the Flash and the Harrasser to get around the map fast. Things like tanks steam-roll anyone who gets in their way. Planes can get you around, destroy♥♥♥♥♥♥and be mobile spawn sites. Sunderes on the gorund can also be a moblie spawn site.The Bad: The lag. DO NOT PLAY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A GOOD INTERNET CONNECTION!!! There is so much lag if you dont have a good connection speed. It makes the game a horror to play.Sometimes other player are real dip♥♥♥♥♥. They team kill you, run you over and scream and swear a LOT! There are also a huge amount of micro-transactions. Like for weapons (you can buy them with ingame money as well, but it takes FOR EVER to get a good one). They are also for vehicles and aircraft. But this is not that bad as you can buy the station cash (micro-transaction money) with Steam Credit.Also, there is a glitch that I experience when if I log off to play another game and I come back later, I can't log on! Not sure if I'm the only one though... but if anyone else experiences it, please tell me!Rant Ended.Conclusion:All in all this game is AWESOME and you should really get it.

15097,theHunter Classic,2016.0,"I have played this game for more than 1000 hours, just not through steam. The game is beautiful and probably the best hunting simulator you'll come across for a very long time. Some new players won't enjoy it because they don't realize that the game is not meant to be played as COD or Battlefield, and you'll have a hard time getting alot of harvests if you sprint around with your rifle when trying to find animals.The biggest problem for new players though, is the awful payment model. You need to buy membership or licenses to be able to hunt all the animals, which costs real money. You also have to buy in-game currency to buy new weapons through the store, which is the only way you'll to be able to take ethical shots on all species. You can buy membership packages (bundles) which comes with discounted weapons and equipment, but it won't take long before you wish you had more callers, camos, tents, weapons, you name it, even if you bought the 1year membership bundle. There are alot of items in the game, and pretty much all of it will cost you real money, aswell as being somewhat expensive compared to most other F2P games.All this taken into consideration, I still love the game, simply because I feel the gameplay is worth the money you need to spend on it to enjoy it. If you are looking for a good hunting simulator, this is your game, but you will have to be willing to spend quite a bit of money on it to be able to enjoy it to it's full potential. If you are just looking for a F2P time-waster, then this game is very likely not something you want to spend much time on. ",1

5148,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI enjoyed this game from the beginning. FInally there was a FTP battle royal game with a class system which didn't involve unnessary complexity (like building in fortnite). However it was always frustrating from the beginning because of how high the player community skill level is. I mean here is an early access game, yet I never once encountered a new player (noob), but rather seemingly all seasoned veterans, who are clearly experts w/ PC shooters. This made the gameplay very frustrating and difficult to intially get into when you barely stand a chance against any of these people. But with this last patch, I would have to dissagree with the people who complain about it and actually argue that it now balances the game MORE. GIving new players and perhaps people who are NOT experts at PC shooters to actually stand a chance. Although, I do think that forging a legendary class weapon at a forge should STILL be an option, as well as obtaining legendaries from chests being a possibility. If the developers make that simple change, everything else is in place to where it needs to be for this game to be the best battle royale game on the market.",1

87,Star Trek Online,2012.0,"I feel that after playing this game for so long, I can write a proper review now. over 900hrs put into this game, so that should say something off the bat. As a fan, Star Trek Online is a trekkie's wet dream come true. The creators have gone through great lengths to honor the Star Trek franchise. Each mission feels like you're playing a tv episode! Fans will notice throughout the game plenty of references to all the various television series as well as many well-known characters like Worf, Spock, etc. Lots of the voice acting done in the game is supported by many of the actors that played various characters throughout Star Trek, so you know this game is legit. For those who aren't exactly Star Trek fans, you'll most likely see this is simply a themed MMO with a typical MMO experience. Plenty of grinding, reputations, and raids which come in the form of ""STFs"". Although there are plenty of quests and things to do, if one gets bored, there's always one of the more under-utlized features: the Foundry. This is a place where players submit custom-made quests for others to play. That's right, user-created missions! This is what I love most about STO. The possibilites are endless, and the game is easy to pick up; no real learning curve at all.",1
2293,Neverwinter,2016.0,"I've jumped around through several ""Free"" MMORPGs.  Thus far, I've found Neverwinter Online to be the most fun. The combat is reactive and skill can matter as much as the skills you choose. I know that a lot of people have cut the game down for being ""pay to win"", but if you are not out to be the most dominate player in the game with all the best gear (right away anyway) then you will have fun.Pro: LOTS of quests with varied objectives.     *Decent community compared to many games. Get in a guild and you will have a lot of fun.     *Good respawn times for MOBs. Not a lot of waiting around.     *You can play casually OR delve into the depth of the game's crafting system.Cons: *The graphics are standard. Not bad, but mostly not going to impress seasoned players. Some nuances ,such as mounts, look very nice though.      *It can be considered pay to win. If you are one of those who really think ""winning"" is possible in an MMO, then you may not like this one.    *The HUD is weak, but can be customized to your liking.There's a lot more to be said about this game, but the bottom line is that it is fun for casual players who fear getting involved in the time-sink that is typically associated with MMOs",1

9747,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewIt is p2w grindfest.Newest update changed system to something we have seen in Hearthstone. Now you receive random loot instead of money after a match. This pretty much means you will spend most of your time grinding aimlessly for poor 25% Robits(equivalent to Hearthstone dust) rate to get parts you want. Any building is also now limited to one robot as you cannot use one part in multiple builds, I scrapped all my robots from pre-update to buy half of weapons for my main one. It is Hearthstone where you can only use your legendary card in only one deck.However grind is not biggest problem of this game. It is kinda annoying when you are at rank 24 an someone playes legendary card in HS, in this game it is much worse. Legendary weapons are constant pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for you as they are pretty much just better.Pre-epic loot it matched you with people who had unlocked same stuff meaning weapons gettin powerful was not a problem. It was also not p2w but more like pay to progress faster, which is something to consider p2w but also it didn't really afect you as f2p player. Nobody cared about how many parts you owned because level was your limiter.On top of this railguns are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.",0
1133,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"One of the best MMO out here for now. The publisher is too kind and linient with the players.

Now i wan to lend my powers to IMC and give a good review and recomend everyone who is unsure if this game is fun or not.IF you are a new player just starting out, it might be scary as there is so many choices in jobs. its always best to visit the forum first and have a birds eye view on the skill build they have. some of the skill build at tos base is out dated. so dun bother going there to have a look at their build.

13360,Magic Duels,2015.0,"I find that the game has quite a few positive qualities.Free to play is always a good entry point. Good soundtrack, I really enjoyed the music which made the multiple and long loading screens more bearable. I also liked the art style, it felt true to magic and was well executed. From what I saw from the story in the tutorial mission the plot, while somewhat cliche, is fitting to the purpose of a young planes walker raising up to be a hero.However...there are 2 big elephants in the code that can't allow me to give this a thumbs up. One - constant crashes. One peculiar example is a specific card play order on the last tutorial mission will ALWAYS result in a crash. Loading screen - crash, check options - crash, click a button - CRASH! In the 2 months since release I fully expect those basic issues to have been addressed by now.The 2nd problem for me is the general interface and the tempo of the turn stages. By default the game puts in place some odd arbitrary presets such as automatically end phase if you can't play a card or automatically pick the order of blocking creatures. Seems like a good way to make the mechanics more accessible to new players but the options don't allow near enough customization to make it an efficient system. For example no option to extend or pause timer automatically if you have an instant in your hand you can play. I have to constantly hammer on the space key in hopes to pause the timer in the ridiculously short timer during an opponents attack phase. I find these mechanics EXTREMELY frustrating and after about an hour of battling with the interface and crashes I am giving this one up. ",0

224,War Thunder,2018.0,"TL;DR - If you enjoy giving up your whole life to play a video game, that is unbalanced as all heck...then sure play it.....prepare to whip out your wallet and just give it to them otherwise.Well i put in enough time on this game to grace it with a review. First i would like to point out that despite it coming out a couple years after World of tanks/planes/ships....it still seemes to mess up the one thing that MOBA's(yes it's a MOBA, last time i checked u couldn't fly/drive from russian to paris or w/e) tend to be good at, and that's team balance in terms of game play. I mean you either ""know"" what to do, or you don't....simple as that, no team covering for you when you want to assault a point, no team providing fire support for you when you defend...it's basically a bunch of people running around shooting at things/people. I say things because there is PVE, although i would wager that some of the AI in this game is cheating...they know exactly where you are at all times, know exactly where to shoot at all times, never miss due to RNG, and will always score kills on you when they hit. It's a shame that such thought went into the RPG aspect of this game (at least more so than World of X) As you can already tell i have played both Gaigin and WG games, i like tanks, like ships more (although Steel Ocean is better at it than these two cash grab companies). All that aside, don't kid yourself this game is just a big ""long Con"" cash grab, the company i would imagine saw just how great and excited (aka dumb and gullible) us gamers were to see that we can progress the ranks and fight with better tanks if we just spent a little (a metric ton to be more clear) gold in the game (gold eagles being the Cash only currency).Don't get me wrong, i know there isn't any such thing as ""free to progress"" free to play meh ok, but most people get bored of playing a couple hours a day just to see you progress down your rank/tier couple 100 xp per battle for a win ( and you will lose often) when you need something like 50K xp to unlock a semi-decent vehicle. It's sad that they show pictures of naval combat on their store page, when they haven't even came close to being done with it....just a another sad marketing ploy by a sad and full of crap Company.

2299,Freestyle 2: Street Basketball,2016.0,"Freestyle2 is a free to play MMO basketball game which is both awesome and nerve-wracking at times. First, I'll get into the positives and then I'll rant about the major issues.To begin with, it's a street basketball, thus, it's played on one basket, there are no fouls, no free throws, etc. Matches last 5 minutes, they have overtimes and replays. I won't be going into the details about the basketball itself because it's self-explanatory. Next, in order to jump into the match, you must pick a position and create a character which is customizable to an extent. Then you'll be launched into a really confusing lobby screen with tons of options. You'll notice card sets, toys (mascots), sh*tload of events and so on. Next, there's training mode which is essential for a newbie. You'll get a chance to practice every ability of your chosen position. Those skills, if not yet acquired, will be available to buy in skill shop as you level up. For more flashy moves you can try equipping freestyles.My problem with this game is that there are a lot of microtransactions which affect your stats and gameplay. You can get stuff like new characters with additional skill points, buffed items and other stuff which increases your abilities and gives you an advantage. Though, it's possible to get them without spending real money but it's pretty tough to do so and only available during certain events.Furthermore, there are many bugs, crashes, freezes and connection stability issues and they show up pretty often and haven't been fixed for too god damn long. Besides, many people state that there's a bitcoin miner inside the game files..  that's a first.TL;DRPros:● Fun gameplay● Addictive● Challenging● A wide choice of clothes, accessories, cards, toys, skills, freestyle, etc● Non-stop events● Great and fitting musicCons:● Slightly pay2win● Many bugs, crashes, freezes, connection issues● Bitcoin miner inside the game● Unchangeable character appearance except for clothes, accessories and hair● Salty communityOverall, this game is so fun and competitive but also has so many problems that prevent me from giving this game a 10 9/10 ",1

2501,Aura Kingdom,2015.0,"Ok, so I can agree. This game has a good fantasy feeling to it, unlike other MMORPGs that just make you bored in 5 minutes of gameplay. The game classes contain some awesome gear and interesting spells, especially when you're the new class.Here are my GOOD sides and my BAD sides:GOOD:1. Class selection is wide ranged, unlike other MMORPGs.2. Recieving free gifts each day and a free eidelon (an in-game pet for starters).3. Friendly players who communicate kindly (most other MMORPGs aren't like this due to ragers and racism).4. The new class is awesomely epic (sorry if awesomely isn't an existing word)5. Good gameplay to make a good hour of footage/streaming on.6. I've always wanted to see a good fantasy RPG that is like Perfect Worlds but got a better aspect to the gameplay.7. The review rating is very positive which means new players every minute.8. Noobies get a good teaching tutorial unlike others where they babble on forever.9. Last but not least, fantastic graphics and music.BAD:1. Unable to switch what gender the class is (most RPGs allow you to do this, make this an update please).2. Some people tend to break all the dungeons which usually crash the game servers. This means that people can't join       fast enough and sometimes can't join at all if they have a bad computer.3. Some advanced players will try to 'help' you in to levelling, instead, all they do is leave you in a high level place and you die. This can be annoying because these players are able to persuade with such good passion that loads of players usually get tricked into it and this CAAAN be pretty rageful towards those type of players...4. You know what I'm going to say, don't you? The graphics. Sometimes the graphics ARE a bit too powerful for some computers. I usually get gigantic lag spikes but at least I don't freeze like I've been saying with some players. 5. Some attacking animations are broken. Bad computers usually make the game crash. I've only had one crash for when I was in a guild dungeon raid and I was attempting to use my sorcerer skill which kind of crashed out my game because the attacking animation was broken. This is usually caused when the creator hasn't been bothered or forget to add an actual animation to that specific skill.6. Finally, FIX THE SERVERS!!! I'm sick of people messaging my on Steam about how the Aura Kingdom servers are not working and it's all cause of me just because I used this special software to boost up my Aura Kingdom. I message them back saying ""It's not my fault the servers ain't working. The software doesn't even affect the servers on Aura Kingdom so stop blaming it on me because it will most likely be a person scamming or exploiting the servers out"". Like, I know Aura Kingdom can't help all these problems due to the game is gettin really popular and sooo many people are trying to join at once-especially at night. Now, I'm never going to stop playing Aura Kingdom due to these problems (I'm going to have to write this quickly because I have a guild dungeon in like 7 minutes and I don't want to miss it because if I do, I'll be kicked out the guild). -  RKIDNB (YouTuber)",1

1231,War Thunder,2013.0,"Fantastic WWII based flight sim, for the great price of free.Currently there's 5 nations available to play (and you can swap at any time) with a whole host of iconic aircraft to play with in any of 3 different play modes which are designed to cater to those that want a fully immersive simulation experience, a quicker, faster and easier to control arcade experience, or for those who find themselves in between.Tanks are due in the near future, with naval combat planned for later on in the games development cycle.  The game run's well on pretty low end systems, and looks absolutely stunning on more powerful gaming rigs, and can be played with mouse and keyboard or joystick well (in fact, mouse and keyboard is actually easier than stick for arcade mode)An RPG style progression system means that you are always able to work towards either improving the planes and crews you have, or unlocking new ones, whilst having a very active developer means that there is always something fresh to try, and some new event or map, etc to try out, plus there's various in game achievements and decal/skin unlocks to work towards to give you a sense of direction when you want it.Freemium unlocks are well balanced, and typically provide a better range of options to a player, than any kind of ""pay to win"" scenario you can find with some other titles.If you like flight combat sims, you need to give this a try.  If you're a fan of FPS style games, take a look anyway, it's surprising how much fun tearing chunks out of aircraft, instead of people, can be. ",1

6545,theHunter Classic,2016.0,"I did not pay anything for this game, but i have greatfun playing it never the less!I honestly can't understand the people who say that this games is crap because it takes them to long to find a animal, or it takes them to long to find an animal they are allwoed to hunt... yada yada yada... moste of the negative reviews cry all about the same♥♥♥♥♥♥If you are not willing or able to just play the damn tutorial and after that use your f*ing brain please go back to school and learn something!The thing about the hunting licenses, yeah as a free player you can hunt 3 animals, White tail deers, european rabbits and phesants, additionally to that 2 randome animals that are changing each thursday. I don't have problems hunting them. If you want to find and hunt them you first should play on the right map and... ahh wait, i don't want to be your tutorial, just play the tutorial and use your brain, after a few hours of gameplay i think you can try writing a review again.I have to admit that this game has very much features you have to buy for a specific time or temporarily and i don't like this either. Also the premium credits are the opposite of being cheap. But if you realy want to have something from the store and don't want to pay money, go play the game with the free stuff and compete in competitions, because there you can win the premium money. I don't say it is easy, but if you want it you can do it.The last thing i want to say is, this game is a very good simulation and you won't find any better! So if you like hunting play the game for free! If you like the game so much you can buy something, nobody forces you to do it!",1

20270,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewArguably one of the best CCG's on steam. Combines the visual aesthetic is similar to Hearthstone but the game plays a lot more like Magic the Gathering. I have well over 200 hours on this game and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon!Eternal has a balanced meta and card mechanics that could not be implemented in a typical trading card game. This game truly is refined and constantly evolving. Highly recommend this game!,1

2388,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI have played tons of games on robocraft.  I have played this game since it was awarded indie game of the year, and might I say props to you for accomplishing that. That said, there are a few things that need to be taken into account:Balance: The game is EXTREMELY unbalanced, the auto lock on missiles are very hard to dodge and are expensive(more on this later) and now the timer has been dropped from taking 2.5 seconds to lock on, to 2 seconds. Not only is this devastating but the main weapons of the game: plasma cannons, and plasma lasers have taken some nerfs. Lasers have reduced fire rate and plasma cannons increase power consumption. This creates a huge divide from the premium users that paid money to get the missiles easily and the basic players who can only afford one laser of a high tier.End game rewards (and money issues in general):I consider myself to not be at the end game, but close to it. My weapons have gotten quite expensive as of late. To list off a few: Top laser disintegrator: 959,549  Plasma devastator: 1,107,169 Disc Shield: 10,876,430     Blink Module: 10,507,740 Aeroflak Cannon: 11,071,688 Lock-on Missile Launcher: 10,149,047Now, this list wouldn’t be too bad, if the payoff was about 60,000~, 80,000~ with premium users in the game. Now, understandably it is frustrating that the most I can get in a game is 110,000~ with a first win of the day bonus and premium users. So, all in all you are required to play approximately 126.86~ games to acquire 1 lock-on missile launcher, let me emphasis this ONE LOCK-ON MISSILE LAUNCHER, and in order to be any use to your team, you’re going to want to pack at least 2 of them, making the amount of games you need to play skyrocket to 252~. This is unbelievable and give NO incentive whatsoever to grind out the game for the RP. I can hear it now, how can I play this game if it takes so long to get something. Easy enough, you just have to pay real life money to obtain all of these weapons, problem solved. For translation it costs you 2,300GC for 1 missile launcher, that would approximate putting $2.50(and a little more to get 50 more GC) and to get two of them you need $5.00 for it. Doesn’t seem like a lot, but this is a “FREE TO PLAY GAME” Why then would you make the game free and then choose to make the game SUCH A HUGE GRIND that you cannot even begin to reach end game content without going past a pay wall or dedicating hours upon hours to a game.Additional premium content:On a side note, I have noticed that glass now costs GC to purchase, no RP method. The three principles upon which this game is built upon is “build, drive, fight” can you drive? Yes. Can you fight? Yes, now building on the other hand. Building has been limited in the terms of glass. Glass used to be a fun cool block that you can use in your vehicle to have, which is now gone, banished behind pay wall.Things they did well at: Fun and amazing gameplay Large variety of game modes to choose from Roboshop to help you get a ship if you suck at creativity Have more than 3 bays for free Testing area Gaining RP for testing your ship against bots (although it is minuscule)I will update my review as major parts of the game are tweaked, but at the moment if given the chance to rate the game at its current state, I would give it a 4/10. This game is below average, it can perform meh compared to most free-to-play Minecraft cube copy games. However, the game still needs LARGE improvements before it can be considered a game to play.

6424,Magic Duels,2016.0,"The game its self has alway been great. But the mechanics of this one is a let down.

IN a regular Booster pack you get 8The cards you get at times are not worth it.I spent 20 bucks in game to get coins and only bought from one edition, and I can't even build a decent deckThe VS is way out of balance.

14402,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"I've been playing this game for about 3 or 4 months now and really enjoy it, my hours will say they are low because I've played through the bethesda launcher. Compared to other CCG's it is very generous. I've played f2p the entire time and have quite a nice collection of epics and legendaries. You get card rewards (including legendaries), gold, and sometimes even pack rewards for leveling up, and you get daily quests that give gold (in game currency) as well. You even get gold and cards (sometimes even a booster pack) everytime you win 3 games. You can use this gold to play arena versus players or the AI in solo arena mode. Both arena modes give fantastic rewards and is where I have gotten most of my collection so far. In fact I bought the newest ""Dark Brotherhood"" expansion entirely from in game gold I earned. The best part of this game to me is the card interaction between so many different cards, and games are not decided before a match begins because of classes or archetype. Decks are very fun to build and even after being around for the better part of a year there are still many ""new"" interactions and decks to be discovered, especially with new monthly cards and certainly future expansions. The meta is not just 1 or 2 decks like ""Quest rogue"" or ""Pirate warrior"". It is exceptionally varied and changes up quite often when new cards get released or something new is discovered. But even when the meta sticks around for a bit there are always decks to build and counter them.Another great thing about this game is the fantastic community. Between avid streamers, youtube content creators, and player-run tournaments, there are plenty of ways to have fun and learn more about the game. Some tips for new players:-Leveling up card rewards are based on your avatar you choose, and you can change it at anytime.-Arena is the best place to get packs and new cards, once you learn the game it becomes quite easy to get multiple booster packs for one arena ticket.-It is not always a good idea to just hit face because of the runes and prophecy mechanics, which make this game very interesting and strategic.",1
2905,School of Dragons,2017.0,i have to say i enjoy this game when i have quests to do i am not a memeber far as i can tell im out of quests. i enjoy that it is a copy of how to train your dragons movie. i do enjoy the fishing farming and takeing one of my adult dragons in battle and get once in blue moon lucky and get gems. key is save them up do not spend them to use to open up extentions and get more quests and so for and so on. slow hard way but price of not being a memeber. my major beef problem issue what have you with the game is i can not chat with anyone. i can not chat in local in clan or even to friends in my list if there people behind them and not bots. idk lol dose not matter i say i do enjoy the game im addiccted to getting gold by fishing and farming i enjoy the side games you can play with your dragon and if you play enough rounds you can level up your dragon pritty fast. but i am seeing that many forget this game is made for a much younger group kidergarden level reason why the quests if you know all there teaching already is insainly easy. all and all if you have grand kids or a child in kindergarden and they can read they would most likly love this game and learn from the quests. ),1

11082,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI used to enjoy this game, but I'm not really excited by it anymore.At the very least, I recommend waiting to try it until the devs claim the game is no longer in Alpha. The gameplay experience has been changing greatly from patch to patch and it's very difficult to understand the developer's intentions or the direction the game is heading in. The game began as a Battle Royale mode for Paladins with various heroes to select from. It then separated from Paladins and became a class-based game with systems like forging, high mobility, and frequent use of powerful abilities. At the time of this review it has become a classless game with less emphasis on forges and abilities and more focus on teamwork and precise gunplay.The future of the game is uncertain as there have been no publicly stated clear goals or roadmap set for where the game is heading. It might not even remain a traditional Battle Royale for all we know.

12530,Neverwinter,2018.0,"Review here - but I know play on PS4This game is fantastic, I only switched to the PS4 because I like the controller better for this game and some of my friends only use PS4's. Solid MMO experience for casual random dungeoning, soloing, and even doing public party stuff.There cash shop is completely nullified if you play their in-game astral diamond stock exchange (took about a month to get everything I wanted, not any of the insane stuff, but things like extra character slots and other necessities). End Game is as expected in an MMO - repeatable quests, raids, PVP (not great at all compared to other MMOs)The Amount of End Game Content is absurdly massive. If you're casual, you may never finish with the amount they put out, if you're hardcore, you can get to an 'end' point, but then do what I do and stay logged off for a summer and come back, then you'll be behind again.The game itself feels like a all around good MMO and the 'free' part is really that, free.

And it still does.As someone who remembers the early days of waiting 10 minutes to get into matches, it pains me to see the game in its current state. But the devs just don't understand how game balance works and that's this game's biggest flaw is that if you don't play the OP weapons then you get slaughtered.For instance.Tanks should have much more weight in a fight than they do. A light tank is essentially a truck with a gun. The ease that you can kill even the tier 3 tanks is laughable. An easy fix would be to adopt a weapon limit to each team. Or the fact than every and I mean EVERY SINGLE SOLDIER can have access to a scoped sniper rifle. Not only that, but properly modified every soldier can have access to a SINGLE BODY SHOT RIFLE.Not to mention the grinding. My God the gridning in this game has gotten terrible. The economy of this game is horrendous. You barely break even on an account with premium time; even then you better not play any fully automatic weapons. You can do very well and still lose most of your money.These are just a few balancing issue that really are easy to fix but all the devs change are things to extract more money from the community.

1195,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewPaladins is not an Overwatch clone. They have their similarities but are two quite distinct games.Positive:- Lots of different champions to choose from.- Champions loadouts are customizable, essentially changing how you play the same champion.- I like the inclusion of items. Allows you to react to your enemies better.- I enjoy the addition of mounts -> it changes game dynamics and you can force people off their mounts.- Games are fairly short (5-20 minutes).- Team interactions and combinations is exciting and fulfilling when properly executed.- Frequent updates and new content (maps, champions, skins).- I like that games cannot be won by simply defending the payload. You must capture the objective to win (allows for comebacks).- Different game modes and you can play on test maps.Negative:- No 'undo' button when buying items. Made a mistake? Too bad.- Occassional hacker (haven't spotted one in a while)- Like any online game, uncooperative teammates can be frustrating to deal with.- Matchmaking is not always fair.- Occassional bugs, lag-spikes, and downed servers.- Requires some grinding (like any other MOBA)Conclusion:Remember, Paladins is still in open-beta. It still has a lot of flaws, but I believe the developers are working hard to improve this game. In the end it comes down to this: do I enjoy playing Paladins? Yes.

7712,Path of Exile,2017.0,"This is the reigning king of the hack-and-slash action RPG (aka Diablo clone). It is the best one ever made so far, and is the spiritual successor to Diablo 2. For fans of D2, Path of Exile is in the running for game of the decade.That's not an exaggeration. Even when the game came out in 2013, when it had zero polish and only three acts, players immediately recognized it as a rival to D3 because of its incomparably deep game systems. PoE revolutionizes many genre staples including the skill tree, the entire currency system, how potions work, and much more. Since then, GGG (the devs) added so many features that I cannot even name them all off the top of my head. They added an expanded class system, the ability to make a personal hideout, and overhauled the endgame. Whenever I put the game down for a few months, there was new content when I came back. Every single nitpick and quality-of-life complaint I ever had about the game has been fixed. Now, with the release of Fall of Oriath (Aug.2017), it feels like the game has come full circle and deliver on the potential it promised. I believe the community will only keep growing.",1

I haven't played modo since I picked it up, and I tried arena but find it lacking in critical ways.  I've tried out hearthstone, gwent, and artifact, but none of them have really taken my interest.  I love that I can pick up and play 1-5 games a day, or if I want to play some events I can play for hours.  The game economy is friendly and sensible, decks are interesting.  I can play draft, sealed, or constructed.  The AI mode is fun for days when I just want to mess around with basically zero thinking, or if I'm on a bad connection or know I'll be interrupted.  The dev team is responsive to community requests, and keeps a close eye on comments (reddit/discord/twitch), in-game feedback, and the constant pile of stats they gather on all aspects of the game.  I haven't felt the game get stale, which is amazing for the length of time I've been playing.  It's easy to play for free, I recommend picking it up to try it out for a bit.  Check in on reddit and discord to get some pointers, the community focus is one of the best parts of the game.

CS:GO is a game that is compatible with any Operating System on ur computer/notebook, you can play this game on any system (notebook/macbook/imac/computer because it doesn't require great specs to be playable. The Character models and weapons texture can maybe be improved, especially the character models. More variouty would do a great work in my opinion, but some people of course do love the game as it is. The weapon skins and items variouty is amazing in this game, you have many options for every weapon. Everyone is able to find something to his/her personal taste which is a great thing. Also every now and then there is an operation, which gives you a nice badge, more maps to play (u will lose them after the operation ended) but meanwhile the operation u can play anytime on those maps which all look great. I want to thank a big part of the community for making amazing stuff in this game. Personally I would rate this game a 9/10 and it's my favorite by far. The only reason I don't rate it 10/10 is because many people are so toxic in this game, but to make them shush is just block communication.

15662,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewHiRez may very well have fixed the glaring issues with OB44, but I'm going to leave this review as it is for posterity.Once upon a time, this was a fun game. back when I started in early October, I found this game to be a nice reprieve from the typical fast-paced, low time-to-kill shooters that one tends to find. I remember all the fun things like how Drogoz could fly at sonic speeds, and all the bad things like Skye's inescapable time bomb. I still flinch a bit when I hear the phrase ""Time's Ticking!"". Unfortunately, time and time again, HiRez have shown that they intrinsically do not care about people having fun. Drogoz' speed limit was the first sign that things were going downhill for me. Instead of incorporating this fun little exploit into his kit, HiRez insisted that everybody has to sluggishly hover about in midair, becoming prime prey for all the hitscan champions out there. This, of course, is the wrong way to go about things. Multiple developers have taken quirks in the code and blown them up into full features, like rocket jumping in Quake, or the genocidal warmonger Gandhi in Civilisation. To me, this change just felt like HiRez were becoming the anti-fun police.Last month, they introduced a new champion, 'Maeve', whose arrival significantly shifted the game's dynamics. Whereas most flankers can be easily dealt with if not caught off-guard, Maeve is so stupidly agile that hitting her is nigh impossible on a champion that doesn't have constant hitscan weapons, not to mention the effective HP that she has from all her health regen cards and her insane damage output. However, the biggest issue with her is that she has rendered Skye completely and utterly obsolete. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to play as Skye anymore. HiRez have killed a champion that his been in this game since the closed beta, yet they've gotten away with it.And now, we've just gone through the 'Season 1' update, wherein they may very well have just signalled this game's death. Firstly, they did not sufficiently test this update; the developers promised a second round of testing on the public test server which never came. And during that sole round, I found that choosing the champion Barik would cause the match to never load up. How have HiRez solved this? By just disabling the champion.And then, there's this god-awful crafting system that they've just introduced. Prior to the update, you could just go ahead and buy cards with the gold that you can grind in-game, but now, the only way to get cards is to unbox them or use 'essence' to purchase them. How is essence obtained? By getting dupe cards in the chests. This makes the game incredibly inaccessible to new players, as they are completely dependant on RNG when it comes to creating a new loadout, and keep in mind that there is 22 champs, with 16 cards each. That means that there is a 1/352 chance of getting the card that you want.Or, rather, it would be that, if there weren't also emotes, poses and sprays in this chest, further decreasing the probability of getting anything useful, never mind the 66 legendary cards, which were just introduced, that can severely change the way a character plays. Now, here's something interesting; before the update, people extrapolated from the costs of the standard cards that legendaries would probably cost 10,000 essence. Despite this being used in calculations all over the place, HiRez decided it would be a good idea to make them cost 18,000 instead. It costs 792000 essence to unlock all the non-default legendary cards. I, a person with most things unlocked, probably average at about 1,500 essence per chest. It is inexcusable how the game has locked away playstyle customisation, one of the game's selling points, behind what is essentially a paywall, since you're going to have to buy boosters if you want to grind for gold, or even just directly pay for the chests.And that's just about the game itself. I could probably go on for a while about the general attitude of the members of the dev team that hand public relations, like one particular fellow who called people that didn't like the old Time Bomb 'noobs' (despite it being a guaranteed kill in a massive range), and how he seems to have disregarded all crticism on Reddit since it's just a 'hole for whiners'.I've seen this level of greed kill a fair few games in my time. I don't want Paladins to die, but at this rate it is going to die a very unceremonious death. Of course, it wouldn't be HiRez' first failure. Just look at Global Agenda and Tribes: Ascend.",0

I muted my mic, but then they get mad, because you cant hear them and yeah.Can't say I'm a fan of bullets not going toward your crosshair either, because of the recoil ""bullet patterns"". It's a problem since they're not random, so you're forced to learn them if you want to compete, because everyone else knows them. So in those situations where you want to hold down the fire button for longer than 1 second during close range combat and go for a headshot, you have to aim at their feet, then a little to the left, then the right. It's incredibly frustrating. Most of the time, you'll get beat by someone who took the time to download the recoil bullet pattern training map and mastered it.So if you have nothing, but free time to play this game everyday, feel like ""training"" and can deal with the overwhelming bad community, then this might be for you.

6847,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewCollectible deckbuilding card games can be a lot of fun.  They are not, however, a legitimate form of mind-to-mind competition.  They're certainly enticing and stimulating, to be sure.  The illusory pull of being able to come up with strategies and collect cards to support that strategy, building from a core idea into a set of techniques, and then unleashing them in matches, testing, refining, it all sounds very cool.  The problem is, in the internet era, an individual's efforts just don't amount to much.  And furthermore, there's far too much luck involved.Sure, you can make progress, as I've done with homebrew decks from time to time, depending on whether the meta allows for the strategies I try.  But for the vast majority of players, you must pay to win and bow to the whims of how the community is building its decks.The specific games in the CCG genre all have their quirks, but in every instance, you're up against the meta.  The game is less about refining your own ideas than it is about efficiently farming cards to steal the ideas of others that have been tested in far more matches than you could ever hope to play on your own.  It's about taking advantage of momentary swings and imbalances in particular card combinations, looking for a weak spot that will rocket you up a few more notches against a ton of other people trying to do the same.  You're not testing your own ideas so much as testing the ideas of the community and its ever-shifting whims, and then changing tactics when you get countered.I don't find the idea of trying to eke out a more than 50% winrate with decks I didn't make up very appealing.  Nor do I like the idea that all my individual efforts are mostly for naught when compared to a whole internet full of people using particular premade netdecks that far outclass me, throwing hundreds of dollars at the game to get all the cards they need.  Sure, I can try to scrape something together and compete, I can appropriate their techniques, but all I'm doing is playing the odds, hoping I draw into lucky strings of cards to make my combos work, hoping they don't draw into theirs.  Hoping that if we both draw into our deck's ultimate concept, that mine trumps theirs in the meta, that they aren't set up to counter me.  I've done pretty well with my homebrew decks, but once you're mired in the silver ranks, you'll start running into decks using enormous amounts of synergistic legendaries that were most likely bought with real money.  Sometimes, draw luck is on your side, other times, it's not.Don't get me wrong, this is still fun a lot of the time.  But it is not a direct competition between minds.  There's too much other crap in the way.  There's a certain amount of skill involved in playing the cards/decks correctly, but at their heart, CCGs are a matter of who has the time and the luck, who is willing to steal the best ideas efficiently.Compare the strategies in CCGs to the strategy found in a game like Go, for instance, where every piece has the same properties and the rules are very simple with no randomness, yet the depth of potential strategies is so all-consuming that people dedicate their whole lives to the game, and the game is capable of opening itself up to higher and higher levels of play as you progress.  In a card game, the pieces you even have access to are based on either your wallet or grinding out the hours.  In a sense, this might be similar on the surface in that more time = more power.  But there's no set of pieces you unlock by studying Go for 1000 hours that will automatically win games for you once they're all out on the board.  You're never stuck with pieces in your bowl that are unplayable because you lack some other amount of power, or finding that you reach into the bowl and there's no stones in there to draw out and play.  Your ideas have a direct expression on the board at all times, and the better your ideas, the stronger your purpose and the more efficient your play, the better you are at the game in a direct correlation.So, all that said, Eternal is still a pretty good example of a game in this genre.  It's pretty close to M:TG, and has a lot of great elements that make it shine with a hell of a lot less RNG than, say, Hearthstone.  The attacking and blocking mechanics engender some interesting mindgames and back and forth.  But it's still a collectible card game at the end of the day, and bound by those same limitations.I'll finish this out by saying that while I still do play Eternal quite a lot, and I usually enjoy my time with it, I can only provisionally recommend it to those who are willing to put up with the usual pay-to-win collectible card game frustrations present in every example of this genre.  If you're up for struggling quite a bit against factors outside of your control, for the sake of the occasional dopamine rush of an earned win interspersed with a lot of unearned wins and losses, well, you could do worse than Eternal.  It certainly whiles away the hours, and what more can we ask for?I'd also like to pose a (somewhat rhetorical) question: what would be so bad about giving all players access to all cards right from the start, and charging a reasonable price to purchase the game?  Or, providing the player with an option to draw cards instead of taking an action, like Infinity Wars does?  Then, much more of your success or failure would rest on your own ingenuity rather than RNG and time/money spent just unlocking the ability to play the game, or getting screwed out of power or card draw.",0

3162,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewIt reminds me of dota and lol just without the creeps. People need to hold and push down (space)lanes acordingly, capture resource points to then acuire upgrades for their ships. Once your teams ships are strong enough to take on the enemies final base a window must be seized, perhaps when some enemies are respawning.It's a great game requiring tactics, teamwork, patience and planning. Shame the only people I come across seem to be incapable of understanding this. Bunch up and rush down one lane seems to be the only play most seem to know. If both blobs pick oposite lanes, whoever reaches the end base first wins only after doing this twice. If both blobs meet they fight, the blobs will then reform and repeat. The most excruciating part though, is waiting for a game.I recomend this though, in the hopes that one day enough tacticly minded people will play this beautiful game and I'll start having some really good edge of the command seat capital battles.",1

9545,Infestation: The New Z,2016.0," Infestation: The New Z Review DISCLAIMERThis review does NOT take into account all the controversies about the game development or whatever happened before this release on Steam as Free to Play. As i have seen many other fellow Reviewers being negatively biased towards the game because of tis past controversies, i want to infor you readers that this is not the case. This review is based only on facts and how the actual content is. Thank you.=== RATING: 3.5 / 10 - Let's put Call of Duty and DayZ together, it will be great, i am sure ===- Absolutely essential to play- Recommended playing- Play it if there's nothing better- Play it only if you really are bored- Not recommended playing ->> Just don't, really === The Good - You have a nice storage box with unlimited space to store all your loot, and nobody will be able to touch it. It cripples the whole game balance, but it's good right?- Surprisingly enough, premium membership is very cheap ($1 for 30 days)- Good variety of weapons and equipment to find and loot- Decent number of zombies- Different maps- Battle Royale mode and testing servers to play without losing loot=== The Bad, The Ugly & The Rotten - When you die and respawn, you will respawn very close to where you died the last time. This is an issue because Regular players will have to wait 3 minutes before being able to resurrect and respawn (or pay a substantial amount of credits), while Premium users will revive immediately and without any cost.- Loot is worthless. Piles upon piles of weapons, ammo and gear in any location with spawns. In a matter of a few days you will be able to ammass a true arsenal, and even buy more supplies from the in-game shop, with the money you earned by defeating players and zombies. Since you have a global inventory only you can access, you will never risk of losing anything you loot and deposit there.- Weapon balance is ridiculous. SMGs, Pistols, Grenades and DMRs are useless, the only viable weapons are Sniper Rifles and Assault RIfles. Assault Rifles have bullet dispersion, which will cripple their effectiveness in medium to long ranges severely. They are only viable in close quarters combat. Sniper rifles instead, have no bullet dispersion, most of them will 1-shot any player even with armor, and are semi-automatic with virtually no bullet drop or travel time. In short words, only snipers are good.- You cannot sell the weapons / equipment you do not need. You can't even delete it, it will stay in your global inventory.- Very bad quality of life mechanics. You cannot, for example, take two half spent magazines and make a full one with those. Equipment will stack in the global inventory but not in your backpack. These are just some examples, the complete list is way too long.- Abhorrent technical compartment. The visual impact is just ugly even with maxed out setting. The level is the one of a game came out 10 years ago, maybe more, and is even very badly optimized and will not run on older computers, even if it should. Models, textures and sound design are very low quality.- Only 2 types of enemy zombies: the small common ones, whicha re slow and easy to kill, and then the super one, which is bigger and takes antire 100 round drums to take out.- Premium-only weapon attachments that will be always better than standard ones, making PVP pretty much pay2win even if the developers claim otherwise.- When people die, they will be sent back to the main menu, in which they will be able to get anything they want from the shop or their global inventory, and then revive, as i said before, very close to where they last dies. This means you cannot really defeat someone, they will just keep coming back and never let you loot in peace after being victorious.- Vehicles are utterly useless and overpriced.- No base building of any kind.- Tons of bugs and graphical glitches will ruin immersion and overall experience=== Conclusion Another failed open-world survival that tries to innovate with many mechanics but fails miserably because of ruined game balance and mechanics, and poor technical work.",0
13862,Heroes & Generals,,update that changed the way tanks take damage was the straw that broke the camels back. The anti-tank weapons and grenades are now useles.

Team Fortress 2 combines the teamwork and the individual skill perfectly, making you feel useful even if the only thing you have done in the match is killing a random person.Nine means nine ways of playing, which actually translates in nine different games. At least at first. As soon as you start unlocking weapons, you will discover that you can play with a class in a whole different way, refreshing your interest for the game.If that weren't enough to keep you playing this game forever, Valve releases updates every few months, weeks, or even days, with tons of fixes and, more importantly, additions to the game, making you want to play more and more.But that is not the best part.

This game, for the first year or so, of its development, release and subsequent updates was a GOOD game. A fun game. A game that drew in people and stole a good chunk of Wargaming's World of Tanks fan/customer base with its air combat in one of three distinctly different game modes. All that changed with the introduction of their BS riddled battle rating system that they would, with each patch, adjust each plane's, and ground vehicles when they were introduced, ""battle rating"" to fight enemies the PLAYERS WHOM MAKE UP A TOP PERCENTAGE AND EXCELL within the vehicles in question while shafting everyone else. Every. Goddamn. Patch. Time and time again you see a major increase in the number of SOVIET aircraft with their UFO like flight models outperforming, even though the Soviet UFO should never have gotten off the airstrip, other aircraft that make the ""UFO"" seem like a volkswagen.

3929,Creativerse,2017.0,"The primary reason I am recommending this game is because it is F2P. I haven't tried pro or spent any money on the game. I have logged a little more than 6 hours of gameplay. It is very similar to Minecraft with no real end goal besides exploration and pure creation. The crafting options are vast and I actually like the feel of the game more than I liked Minecraft. However,  finding the materials you need to upgrade tools and stuff is a nightmare and there is true mechanic of where to find certain ores. When I actually googled how to find Iron Ore, many actually recommended just running around looking for treasure chests because mining is less efficient. IMO, that is just crazy. And half the time when I am mining, I an ore I really have no interest in is in my way, and have to use an extractor just to continue on or mine around it.

7877,Creativerse,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewIn my books, this is the best voxel sandbox-game up until today:- Good Graphics, vibrant colors, cartoonish- Cool game mechanics (rotate blocks, gliders, gravity settings, blueprints, machines, etc.)- Best community i've ever seen so far (great support  from the devs, competitions organised by players, guides, ideas and suggestions posted by players and turned into reality by the devs)- So far every update improved the game even more (unlike other f2p games that usualy take a turn for the worse really quick), with bug fixes, added content and cool events.I highly recommend this game.Keep up with the good work!",1

5045,War Thunder,2015.0,"With the recent patches made to this game Tier 4 is being crushed due to tanks that they can do nothing against. That is no the worst part, anyone who says anything on it about the forums is having their thread locked. Do not play this game you are encouraging the developers to do crazy things like this, or if you do play it stay away from any battle rating in tank battles higher than 5.0, it is ruled by tanks you are nothing but cannon fodder to. As I said the devs are silencing anyone who voices a negative opinion on this topic. They also DO NOT listen to the community as planes have been asked to be taken out of tank battles ever since they were implemented and Gaijin have firmly stated they are staying.The censoring has gotten worse, they have been threatening youtubers who say negative things about their game and forcing them to say positive things or else their chanel gets deleted. this is a complete violation of youtubes copyright system. After the first time they did this and the backlash from it there was another youtuber who brought to light cheats people were using, not saying where to find them or how to install them and this time instead of doing what they did previously they held a poll on the forums that let players vote if the video should stay up or not so that they could be justified in taking it down. This is yet again more abuse of youtubes system and is also Gaijin using their own community for personal gain. DO NOT PLAY!

1652,Infestation: The New Z,2017.0,I DONT EVEN THIS GAME.Glitchy graphics or hacks.xD it is so broken.I would play this game but wtf is wrong with this game why am i disconnecting from the servers.WORST GAME EVER thats all i have to say.,0
9594,Star Trek Online,2015.0,"My opinion? I would say about 7/10.First, as a Trek fan I enjoy that it continues the story of the Prime universe, and that there are tons of call backs, references, and even cameos.Now, when I started, I admittedly felt like the controls were a tad awkward, but once I got used to them. I've found that that's all I really needed: to get used to them.The space combat is highly reminicent of what's seen in the shows/movies, even including attacks/abilities that can be traced to commands given by the various captains across the generations.The ground combat/missions could be better, but I personally find them tolerable.The graphics are good, but not fantastic, and it tells a good story overall.Also, if you love the ability to customize virtually everything(no, that's not an exageration), you'll get a kick out of this game. You can customize your outfits, your ships(with some restrictions based ship's class/type etc), alter your bridge officers, and even create your own species.The crafting system is a bit tedious, and materials are hard to come by, but it's not horrible.Now, if I had to name my biggest issue with this game, its the same as most MMOs: the microtransactions. By using real money to by 'Zen'(100 Zen = $1), you can unlock a lot of stuff, but some of it is kinda petty and/or overpriced. For example if you want to get a new ship past level 50(that's appropriate to your level), you better be willing to pay out $25 PER SHIP. Granted,, there are other ways to secure new level appropriate ships, but most are geared for LV 50, and require grinding for special currencies to aquire.Also, I have to say I've notice the community tends to be a bit juvenile.  Even though there do appear to be some more mature people among the community, by and large I would recommend just soloing unless you really need help.So, overall the gameplay is enjoyable and good for Trek fans, plus it also has some good storytelling and decent graphics. But, the petty money stuff and largely immature community are a bit offputting. If you are a Trek fan, or just love MMOs with lots of customization and decent story, check it out, and enjoy some nostalgia.If you aren't a Trek fan, can't stand stupid players, or hate microtransactions...feel free to give it a try, but it may not be for you.",1

9406,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you've ever played Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering, this is the real digital experience for you. Magic is a fantastic game, but it's old and doesn't translate well to online play. Hearthstone is quick and easy but lacks a lot of interaction with your opponent and always felt a bit flat to me. Eternal is the best of both worlds, with some extras. The game is silky smooth like Hearthstone, with some cool extra modes like Forge (AI controlled draft/Arena) and easy ""grinding"" (You will get cards at a *much* faster rate than in Hearthstone and have more choices in how to grind). On top of that it has stellar game play like I've come to expect from a much deeper game like Magic: The Gathering. It's hard to recommend this game highly enough. I went from playing Magic Online 30hrs or more a week to playing Eternal for 40 or more and it's swiftly looking to become my main stream game as well as something I actually enjoy playing off-stream as well. AAA quality here.",1
515,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewRobocraft used to be a very good game.Used to be.Now it is a slow running pile of garbage, with extremely unbalanced guns, repeatedly changing game modes, a major Pay2Win aspect, and it crashes constantly.During playing, I've repeatedly experienced crashing whilst building (removing all of my progress) and a failed connection which was not my fault, yet still gives me a ban.CPU Costs are majorly underrated, the rocket launcher and ion based weapons are extremely powerful, whilst you're lucky to get 4000 damage in a match with the second best laser cannons, and Plasma got even worse.Bugs are constant, Modules are overpowered, and the game only gets fun, and you only get a good ship, if you invest money, thousands of hours, OR are lucky enough to have gotten the alienware promotion (like me).I started this game with the pilot and tech tree, and it's going to end here, with protonium crates giving 1000 robits, 1 per match if topscoring, so you have to win 150 matches to get a module.It is incredibly hard to advance whatsoever in normal mode, starting players get a huge boost of which is unbalanced to old players, and this game is quite frankly trash.",0

An absolutely amazing space battleship game which really doesn't have an equal right now.Pros:+ works fine+ looks stunning+ plays really well+ extremly easy to get into (no spreadsheets)+ INSANE amount of potentialThere are no cons, anything that could be even remotely considered a con (lack of content, one map, no party system, etc.) is because this is still in early access.

It does have an increasing amount of cards now, as opposed to the older Planeswalker series which came out annually, and continues to be updated by the devs. I would really like to see them add older sets, hold events and/or short-term tournaments, allow for more matchmaking options, and give us more ways to make free coins. Having said that, this is a FTP game and for what it gives you is great in short burts on a daily or weekly basis. I would gladly pay a few dollars to see more put in to this game.",1

1258,SMITE®,2017.0,"There is no such thing as a simple review for a game which is so vast in its complexities.  But in short, the game is amazing.  The playerbase ranges from super friendly to little mortons salt girls and the three trolls under the bridge and everything in between.  Some players understand too much of the game and get bent if you don't select the character they want you to select and or buy the items they want you to select, and others just give great tips and don't mind carrying you a few games to show you the ropes.  I definitely recommend watching some videos on how to play before you just jump in though as I mentioned the game is pretty complex.  If you show up to a team game and you obviously didn't listen to the tutorials people will get frustrated.  The problem is that unlike other pvp games you dying repeatedly because you attack like leeroy jenkins during a raid makes your enemies stronger which causes your team to die also... Pay attention to the tutorials and ask a friend about what to buy for your chosen god... you really want to set it up BEFORE you go in to multiplayer matchmaking.  Those valuable seconds you spend searching during multiplayer will get your team killed.  I definitely recommend this game, but don't waste all your money buying skins... if you are able to resist!",1
18794,War Thunder,2018.0,"This game. It's a proper MMO, but I can't simply recommend it. It's fun as hell but it soon just becomes a chore to get new vehicles, spending countless hours playing boring matches to get a new plane only to do more boring matches. The controls are great, the 30 dollar campaign is great, the scenarios are really fun but it's just a pain to get anywhere passed Tier 3, with me, not being an avid player (wow, I want to play other games), taking a little less than a year to get my first jet.

12110,Neverwinter,2014.0,"Pros - -Straightforward gameplay, follow the ground glitter and 95% of the time, you will find where you have to go for a quest.-Really fun quests and storyline.-Breathtaking sceanery, that bridge in the ice is what?-No new abilties every level, (unlike many other MMOs) pick what you like and improve what you like AND no full hotbar for every ability you only have 3 slots (4 for wizard). So how you play changes depending on which ability set you slot.-Most vetern players are friendly and willing to help new players learn content. (Some are elietist who kick you for being new, but most are more helpful.)-Foundry community makes some of the most fun adventures EVER! (Shoutout to [Tired of being the Hero].)Cons - -Pay To Win, If you want any chance at endgame, you gotta shell out money for Zen to buy weapon and armor enchantments, enchantment improvements, and stronger companions. Yes you can farm the Astral Diamonds and use that to buy Zen, but if nobody is selling Zen you are stuck waiting or struggling on content that is beyond your gear.-Game constantly advertises someone winning rare lockbox loot. ""Player:(LuckyDude) won a [Shiny Unicorn mount) from [IceCrystalGemMetal Lockbox]."" as if it is always trying to get you to try your luck...~LIKE A CASINO~-End Game Content (Icewind Dale for me) was VERY long to reach, had to do daily quests for over a month to unlock it.-Account security is only as good as your ability to not use the same login/password elsewhere. (yes, I failed this and logged in to see my character emptied out.)-Admins / customer service type very good english but are not the brightest tools. (lost all equipment and entire inventory and 400,000 Astral Diamonds and ~200 Zen. Everything recovered but BUT AD and Zen. 3 more tries were made, but nothing else was returned.

11896,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"I wish Steam had a middle-ground option. The game is a lot of fun, even if you don't want to pay money. Plenty of content, good looking environments. It IS a bit of a grind-fest.The problem is the server populations are composed of a metric crap-ton of bots and the actual players are farming rare drops in lower zones and so a zone instance can easily have NO MOBS IN IT.  Zero. I traversed an entire zone and encountered 3 mobs. There were several archer bots running around though. I assume they were bots, most players don't name themselves ""hUuWUISI"" and ""IWNAoofiawi"".You can't use the trade board for 3 days after you join a server, which was done to help prevent RMT bots from selling crap on the board; problem is there are easy workarounds for that, so all it does is keep you, the new player, from being able to get decent cheap low end gear.So, should you try it out? Yes. Should you stick with it and play it as a primary MMO? Probably not.",1

917,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2016.0,"I regret getting into this.I very quickly became...well, for lack of a better term...obsessed.I would buy chests whenever they would do the ""free"" golden upgrade when you buy a chest! Over the course of playing this game I've spent quite a pretty penny. You can only get the best weapons through those limited time deals, which is why they would sucker me in. There is a problem when the best content is locked behind a never ending pay wall. That is where I draw the line between a ""good"" free to play game and a bad one. This is a bad one with grabby money tactics. And for every new flavor of the event crusaders that are added, there a ""special limited time only"" chests to buy to get equipment just for them!! It honestly just feels so scammy. The prices are a LOT for what you are getting. You do NOT get a good value, at all, don't let their ""sales"" fool you.  Don't waste your money on this game. They add only benched heroes, no actual new ones...so, in other words, you are perpetually swapping out your favorite crusaders for the new cash-grab flavor of the event crusaders (that are almost always better). There are a few positives, such as a nice passive trait tree they've added. But, let me warn you, this game gets very repetitive when you do the exact. same. thing. over. and. over. and. over. You will hardly ever switch up your technique (until the new flavor of the event) because that one group is effective for anything you'd do. I am a lover of idle games...just not this one. Try Tap Titans instead. It is superior to this game tenfold. And they don't lock the best stuff behind a never ending treadmill of purchases.Note: if you have a lot of self control so you do not spend money, and you don't mind the best items being locked behind event pay walls that refresh every month or so, don't mind the pointless grind (because you aren't really working towards anything worth getting, even though they do have a passive way to spent idols...it just doesn't feel rewarding), and if you don't mind using the same crusaders (because they never add any new heroes, they only add heroes to existing benches... it's hard to explain if you don't play the game. You'll have to swap out your favorite heroes for the flavor of the event)...if you don't mind any of that, you will like this game.I, on the other hand, am tired of supporting these horrible free to play market developers who, when all is said and done, gets a lot more money from people by their sly tricks than AAA/Indie developers of REAL GAMES will get... and that is just sad. From now on, I pledge myself to only purchase from legit game developers...those that care about more than just money and releasing an endless treadmill of cash grabby crap.Edit: I wish that I could find a screenshot. I can't help but laugh hysterically... the new shop page has two special event chests promotions going on!!! A set of 3 chests costs 5$!! They used to be 2.99$!! And, get this, ""Buy an event jeweled chest bundle today and get a FREE GOLDEN EPIC CARD that you won't find anywhere else!"". And there are two unique ones because there are two unique event chests going on... holy scam. Please, please, don't support these developers.Stop giving them money. I beg you not to do it. Don't fall into the trap. We, as people, have to tell devleopers that this is the wrong way of making money. Why are these online prices, something you will never see or feel in your hand, something that is temporary, something that is completely RNG (you most likely will get crap out of your 3 chests you buy for 5$ because they want you to buy a bunch of them... 42 chests for 50$ would still give you crap once you get going in your game and have a few hundred hours of time spent...)...something that is not guaranteed should NEVER BE THAT MUCH MONEY!! This market isn't for the customers, despite it's ""free"" nature...those that actually pay and support the developers are being ripped off by ridiculously high prices for what the stuff is actually worth. Maybe I am alone in this...maybe not. Only time will tell how this market goes.",0

I have only two planes (F-15, F-5) and I wish I had more. Hit me up if you wanna buy me the planes I want (F-18, Mig 21, M2000). The plane details are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and flying them feels so good. If you get a plane that's not apart of ""Flaming Cliffs"" prepare your self for 250+ page manuals on how to get your plane in the air. I recommend the F-15 as the first plane you get, why is this? I recommend it because it only takes a few buttons to start up and you don't need to trim all the time once you take off. You can have a 5 course meal and not have to worry about the F-15 rolling to the right or left unintentionally.Unlike most people, I use a yoke + throttle quadrant and others use a joy stick. Flying with a yoke is easy IMO, but it takes adjusting to figure out the perfect sensitivity. I highly recommend a yoke because it's cheaper and easier to use.The only thing I hate about this game are expensive prices for planes (it's worht it though) and no one in multiplayer. Multiplayer is absolutely deserted, and NO I'm not doing missions! Using statistics, usually 150-350 people play DCS world according to last month. So, if you're looking for highly dense multiplayer this is not for you.Do not listen to bad reviews.

19177,H1Z1,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewBom pessoal, é o seguinte, eu jogo esse jogo aqui desde o tempo em que ele não tinha divisão, ou seja, quando just survive e king of the kill eram o mesmo jogo. Nesse tempo, o jogo estava extremamente mal otimizado. Eu tenho um pc com processador i5 3330, placa de video gtx 750 ti e 8gb de ram e com essas configurações o jogo deveria rodar no ultra com uma boa folga, mas não era isso que acontecia. Nem no low, com as texturas e qualidades gráficas escrotas, ele rodava direito. Esse jogo tinha drops constantes de FPS. Na maioria das vezes, rodando em 100 fps, caia rapidamente pra 20, 15, e isso era direto, quase todos os minutos da jogatina, fazendo com que ficasse impossivel de jogar. Agora na divisão, o jogo ficou um pouquinho mais otimizado, só que quase nada mesmo. Os drops de FPS ainda continuam muito constantes, não importando a qualidade gráfica que se deixe. No meu ver, ainda continua injogável. Espero que em algum dia, a daybreak resolva otimizar esse jogo pra todos os usuarios poderem desfrutar de uma qualidade gráfica aceitável para se jogar, principalmente aqueles que tem um pc com os requisitos recomendados para se jogar no maior gráfico possível e que infelizmente não podem, por mal comprometimento da equipe em trazer um jogo bem otimizado.

4010,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"I can not in full faith recommend this game to anyone. The game has some huge fundamental problems.The game features several different controls depending on how you want to play. It's great that they offer the ability to change on the fly at any point. However, it does come with the problem of things like keyboard prompts appearing while playing with a controller.The gameplay itself is rather bland. It's slightly more active than a typical M-M-O game, but still lacking. The addition of awful server lag every time I played didn't help in this regard. It always felt like too many people were in a channel even if it displayed the capacity as being on the lower end. Sometimes you would also get thrown into the high capacity ones for seemingly no reason. Towns have plenty of silver spammers already. The speech bubbles that appear with their world chat spam will cover the UI / menus and be incredibly fustrating to deal with on the first encounter. Thankfully you can turn these global chat bubbles off and save yourself some pain. HOWEVER, the worst part is that the bubbles will actually LAG your game, and what does disabling them do? Only hides them. YOU WILL STILL LAG. I kid you not.Tree of Savior quickly runs out of quests for it's newbies. Around LVL 30 you'll hit a wall of a lack of quest lines in the starting area of your choice. Now you can go to the other starting area and progress through that one as well, but variety is pretty much non-existant as far as I could tell. The class system is where the meat of the game is. Plenty of options to choose and pick from.The game is free though and worth taking a look if you have the data to spare. Honestly to me it's just another MMORPG to throw in the bucket. I'd recommend Path of Exile if you want deep and complex character builds with RPG elements. It's free to play as well.",0

NO, that is not how adults should act (unlike them spoiled streamers). I will however watch the Devs clean up their mistakes and continue to play the game for fun with my friends.     Do I think alot of work needs to be done on our version they released? OH, Heck yes. And unlike, alot of the community here on steam, I believe in time they will get the game up to how they intended it to be released.     Do I think it is a cash grab? NO, I came from Black Desert Online where YOU MUST PAY TO RNG... I feel in Bless I can comfortably buy the base game and not feel like I have to spend 1500$ to catch my breath getting to where i feel i should be. (don't take this as comparing to BDO, I love BDO. I still play the game..)       So far in the game I see a few postive things, One being their actual player base. Everyone who did NOT refund.... and still is actively playing the game is so warming, The community in game is not toxic like Other MMO's. I have talked to many players by just exploring the game and they we're cool people. So Thank you spoiled brats for refunding your games.... Bless doesn't need your salty attitudes. XD     I have had fun doing the PVE aspect of Bless and taming every thing the most so far. I find it is a fresh MMO that everyone who enjoys having a role such as healers or Tanking. Should TRY bless. And not just for 5 mins and say what everyone else thinks, Honestly try it. As if it was a brand new MMO, Try it with the knowledge that it is NOT perfect, but nor is any human on this fricken planet so, remember this... not ""OMGBESTGAMEVER! Oh but he said.. she said... this streamer said.. but the reviews..."" No. Just, No. Your an adult. Or should be if you're reading this...So uh, act like one? And play it the way you want to. If you don't like it then that is a you problem not the Devs problem...      I have high hopes of Bless not failing as much as it is a older game and our release wasn't up to standards, it is still an enjoyable game to play.

3608,Champions Online,2012.0,"*****************A Message To The Development Team*****************To the handful of developers who still work passionately on CO: I am sorry. I know you, as game developers with some heart, lament with me the shift in CO's destiny. I thank you for your hard work with a meager budget and limited resources, pushing out what little content you are able to squeeze in between company-mandated monetization pushes.To the rest of you: Unless you are a roleplayer, steer clear. The superhero MMO as a successful genre died with City of Heroes, and since CO got thrown to the wolves, there is no longer a replacement. Champions Online is likely to follow in its footsteps, because PWE has Neverwinter now and that makes a /ton/ more money. PWE is not a company known for taking risks - why bother spending anything on CO?  So, from Atlas Park to Millennium Plaza, to wherever the superhero winds take us next. Overwatch, maybe?************The Long Version Of The Review************I have to change my generally positive review given the changed face of the game.Allow me to present you a brief history of grief:A few years ago, some of the original developers got their hands back on the game and we were promised a /surge/ of new content! Hooray! ""New content"" in this case meant a few new cosmetic items, and the ability to /purchase/ some new configurations of /already existing/ powers.Before that, PWE picked up the game and we were promised /stable growth/ and a business model that was faithful to the original plan! What we got was Lockbox Online, and no content that ever addressed the massive balance issues between content or the clumsy, flimsy-feeling absolute lack of tactile feedback that tries to pass for controls.Before THAT, we were promised ""near-endless customization""...well wait, we got that. Eighty percent of the choices you can make are broken and wrong, but I guess technically you /can/ make them. Hell, even the lockboxes are on a repeating schedule now. Can't even get new lockboxes.Looking at it from the outside, you'd think a well-to-do publisher with free access to the game's code and design documents could maybe do better. Maybe they could invest a little into the game and grow it beyond a gluttonous shadow of a passionate team's failed dream.I /remember/ the passion. I remember the hype. I remember reading these long blog posts about what we could do with a game like CO, and I remember being overjoyed that such a good team was in such a good position to deliver such a great game.I really wish I had bottled some of that hype, because I am really missing it.***************From Top To Bottom: The TL;DR Version***************1) Combat is shallow, flimsy, and stale. Powers feel ""fake,"" and very little feels impactful or even tactile.2) If you aren't 40, you can forget about grouping up (if you didn't trick your friends into downloading too.) Get used to solo play. REALLY BORING solo play. For HOURS. Nobody even wants to look at you if you aren't 40. You might not even exist. Who can say? 3) The much-lauded (and admittedly pretty cool) character customization system is almost entirely locked behind a paywall, with other little paywalls waiting in ambush just beyond that. The character of your dreams awaits! Shame there's very little worth doing with them.4) ""Missions"" are glorified kill-counters. Kill blue men. Kill red men. Kill monkey guys. None of the zones feel unique or original. If I have to kill one more purple ganger I'm going to start crapping purple out of every orifice.5) They added level-agnostic group content! Hooray! Unfortunately, this too is ""kill blue men"" followed by ""kill red men."" Instead of addressing the absolute lack of solidity and visual reciprocity in the game's movement and combat systems, they wrapped the existing clusterf*** up in new colors.6) Oh my god the voice acting. Oh my GOD the voice acting. Please, please, please, please...go back in time and just...spend just a little more on audio design. Please.**************A Conclusion**************I really, really wanted to like this game. I put a lot of hours into it, even while CoX was up. I really liked the idea of truly freeform characters and action-oriented combat. I played the hell out of it back when we had the promise of growth and bug fixes. I made lots of friends - I still have a big friends list of ""offline"" CO players when I log into Neverwinter.I really, really wanted to like this game. I really believe it could still be something special if the publisher wasn't just using it like a digital soup bone. Put some of that sweet Neverwinter money into it. Knock out the bugs. Give us some UI improvements, some dynamic combat, some new types of encounter.Give us PUBG-style survival matches. Give us MOBA mechanics. Give us racing, or team-up attacks, or buy the CoX license and give us the damn Skulls. Give us ANYTHING NEW. It doesn't even really matter at this point. Anything would be a blessing.But it won't happen, because this promising, once-beloved game has been sold for spare parts.",0

16552,Infestation: The New Z,2017.0,"Compared to the majority of previous...attemps at making this game what it could of been, I believe it has hit closest to home. Having beginner servers where it feels like the PvP is equally matched, as well as a place where new players can experience the overly done amount of loot is great, as when you hop on an official server that has high population, there's no doubt that you'll be popped in moments by a sniper depending on where you are (That's a downfall, but the majority of the time this can be avoided by just carefully selecting a server). The game mode 'Battle Royale' is great fun, but it feels like a heavy waste of time if you reach the top 10 and don't come in the top 3. I find that I reach the top 10 in a good amount of games, only to die before getting to the top 3 as people with heavy amounts of meds can sit in the radiation zone longer when the safezone circle is tiny, so they can easily pick you off. The PvP servers are good, if you have already gathered a mighty stash worth of guns that you really don't care about losing (A lot of game time till these servers become viable I believe).The warmup servers helpful as you don't lose your gear, but you do lose your consumables, so you need to bring a whole lot of meds & ammo for a gamemode where you achieve nothing but warming up.Overall, this type of game is still toxic, but a lot better than the previous ones and it does seem like it's heading in the right direction, there's bad parts, but good counter parts.",1

11682,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"First off, I absolutely LOVE Tree of Savior. It really had a ton of potential to be a great game. Unfortunately the company running it has caused problems and ruined their own game. The combat style is fun, but allows every player to afk farm certain mobs (due to static respawn points) by simply setting a book on their attack key. There is no forced logouts, which means (you guessed it) bots are RAMPANT. Half the players you meet will seemingly teleport around your screen and attack mobs before you can, or you are simply fighting them for spawns. This problem is awful from level 15-40. The bots seem to die off a bit after that, but I haven't made it to max level to see what that is like.IMC has done NOTHING about their botting problem, nor about the pretty toxic playerbase whom are pretty awful at the best of times, I can only imagine their attitude is due to their profits. Someone is supplying these people with tokens, be it themselves or others, and they are getting paid. The economy is a joke, and the restrictions placed on trading an item or using their auction house are god awful. I really enjoy their game, but until the botting problems and gold spammer problems are fixed a bit, I can't recommend this game to other people, which is such a shame. If you made it this far, I'll share some of the things I love and hate.-There is quite a lot to do-The art and music are AMAZING. Totally my style. -The combat is fun, but if you lag with a melee class you will be VERY annoyed in short order. (Most of my lag is due to my poor internet connection, not the servers but the punishment from the lag is totally lost melee attacks. Like, I attacked, I saw my character swing his weapon... and NOTHING happens. Unless you attack 2+ times, this will happen with a bad connection and you will almost always lose that first attack.)-Real-money is the ONLY option for resetting your skills or stat points, not sure if thats good or bad tbh. Choices matter, but ehh should be in-game option.-Sadly, you are locked into your class choices. If you pick the wrong class, or the class you picked turns out to not be so fun ONE time... Guess what? Better start over. Even if you are level 200 and simply made a bad call or thought something worked a different way.-There are very few resources for information. I know this is due to how new the game is but, because of the beta testing, a lot of information you find is old and has since been changed. Even trying to research a good class selection or which stats to pump at max level is next to impossible. Which is why I feel being locked into class choices is such a bad idea.",0
14085,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2014.0,Entered the game without knowing fully what to expect from it. When I started it I realised this was the perfect game for a gun nut such as myself.

Try it out!,1
19195,Creativerse,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is awesome!While at first, it may seem like a minecraft clone, but the only thing minecraft-like that it has in it, is the blocky world, everything else isn't blocky... (for some reason)It's really fun to play it and while you can get the best gear in the game pretty fast (took me like 20 hours) its still fun to explore and find new things.I do have some complains about it tho:The mob variety isnt THAT good... There are mobs such as Pigsys and Leafis, and they just made them a little different in other biomes (Dried Leafi, Feral Pigsy, blah blah blah etc) and the enemies are just basically the animals but aggressive and kinda glow in the dark.Which kinda sucks considering that the game itself is so pretty,  and does so many things so good, but when it comes to enemies and mobs, it can get pretty darn predictive.It also has some bugs that need to be fixed of course, I mean would you really expect an Early Access Game to be perfect and with no bugs? No... No you wouldn't...This game is beautiful, its not like in minecraft with pixelated blocks, they are pretty detailedThere is also a store which you can buy stuff from (I know this sounds bad, but believe me it really isn't)You can buy stuff with coins (bundle packs of decorative blocks and such or blueprints for buildings which will tell you how to build that building you want to) but with the blueprints you can also get it with no coins neccessary, the difference between having it bought with coins is that it will give you the blocks neccessary to build that building, while if you get it with no coins, and you craft it, well... You are going to have (a bad time) to get the blocks CRAFTED to build that building... It kinda sucks, it sounds pay to win but...it isn't.I highly reccommend this game and i hope if you do install it, have fun playing it!",1

14509,theHunter Classic,2014.0,"This game at first made me upset. I saw the ""free 2 play"" label and though, this will be awesome. I will admit, my thoughts as of first were bad. I did not like I had only one gun, that could only kill one of the two species I was allowed to hunt. And the fact that only one map really allowed me to play. I will be frank, the ""free 2 play"" portion is more of a demo really.But You'll notice I have put in lots of hours. I did indeed pay for the 3 month subscription, and indeed bought several guns and sights for them. This game, will cost about 40-50 dollars to get up and active with the full range of everything to enjoy. I will say though, I am very happy with the quality of the game versus this cost. I very much enjoy this game, and have found it both a rush and a calm, pleasant experience.I will not forget that moment where I dropped a buck with a muzzleloader for the first time. Or the time I killed a charging Moose with a WW2 German K98. This game will cost you to enjoy it fully, but I do recommend it, and I am very pleased. I consider it money well spent, it is a very detailed, fun, enjoyable hunting game. And With my physical CD collection of hunting games, rate this as the best.9/10 is my score, only because sometimes the rendering gets finnicky. 99% of the time, works well and plays amazingly. Looks beautiful, and is the best hunting game I've played.",1
4291,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAt first I really enjoyed the game and found myself winningg and having fun. I kept going up in rank ant then it happened - cheaters. The output of the people once you hit the silver league is often clearly illegitiment. I am fine with losing as long at it was a fair fight, and still fought may rounds at the silver level where the player was clearly not cheating but just good - those were tough but fair matches I lost. However, once you get to that point you will start finding players who are clearly able to output more cards than they could possibly have mana. That's when it lost me. Fix the cheating problem and I will return... Not recommended - shame too it was fun until I realized I won't get beyond a certain league without cheating.",0

It is free but has many in app purchases, I advise not to send your dwellers exploring over night and always have security on guard.

12908,Trove,2018.0,"Been playing this game for a long time. not in Steam, on trion launcher. and I can tell that this game is so good. But after its release, the game changed really much. It was a good game, but this ""pay2win"" thing finally reached this game. Thanks devs, its all about money, isn't it ?Welcome to grinding simulator 2018 everyone, in this game, you pay all of your money to the devs to get actually good, or spend hundreds of hours just killing thousands of enemies and completing hundreds of dungeons around the world with dumb puzzles in it, which you don't even need to complete them just dig the block under you until you reach the boss or if its above just use your multiplied jump boost to get all the way up.The game is really fun,but only if you want to goof around with your friends or if you'd like to just chat and get to know some random players around the world, this game's for you. Which I'm actually doing this, chatting with random people while playing the game and grinding.The grinding is really bad, boring and makes you mad, I know that myself. But If you manage to find a way to grind this game without getting bored, it can actually work out. Like, you can actually have fun in this game. I actually don't play this game anymore since the game is completely dumb right now, but you can try it out.Also there is ""Test Servers"" for experienced players to try out upcoming things in the future, in these servers I believe you have unlimited access to everything, you have unlimited money, you can spawn things, you can get any kind of item for free on store and so on. But there is a Queue or some kind of thing for this server for a reason, I don't know why they did this, but one day I tried to join the server, I was the 12th person in queue. I left it open for several hours, around 6-7 and nothing happened. I was finally down to 6, then for a reason i kept getting up to 8 or 9. Finally i was 2th person, then 1st and poof. That was it. It just got stuck on 1st, i thought its having connection problems or some kind of a lag so i left it open again for several hours. And nothing. It still said 1st. I tried to get this server working for several times, and everytime i do this i started at as 10 or 30 in queue. And the same problem happened, maybe waited even 2 days but it kept getting stuck on 1st.I would pretty much say don't play it if you don't have any friends to play with. Because this game is hella boring when you don't have anyone with you.Overall, pay2win -7it needs grinding -3Only fun if you have friends +1Nice community (Its actually the only good thing about this game) +34/10",0

12918,Dota 2,2011.0,"2017:Did not play much for this year due to work.2016:After 5 years of Dota 2, all the heroes are finally released and the next newest hero, Monkey King is coming out in December this year.Dota 2 has become a spectator sport in the footsteps of traditional sports such as Basketball and Football, in the sense that they are all team-oriented games and require strategy to win.  Through the recent gameplay patches of 6.87 and 6.88, there have been many new changes that focuses more on the strategic aspects of the game, namely Scans and cheaper more defensive items.New items such as Echo Sabre and Hurricane Pike also serve to make competitive games more exciting as teams that have fallen behind in the early game now have a chance to comeback with the cheaper mid-tier but very cost-efficient items giving them an opportunity to fight back.""Everything can work""As a whole, Dota 2 has become a game very much focused on positioning and the right draft composition of heroes for the game match at hand. No particular strategy has dominated the tournament scene this year, be it push, defensive splitpush, or teamfight, and it is this remarkable balance that allows many teams with varied style tendencies to showcase their way of playing without feeling disadvantaged. Be it EG's methodical lane dominance and calm style, MVP Phoenix's all-in teamfight style, EHOME's strategic drafting style, or TI6 Winners - Wings' anything goes style.Valve has also shown interest in further expanding the game through its released custom games feature for Dota 2 and Virtual Reality support for spectating. Overall, its been a good year for Dota 2, the game is more fun than ever with any strategy being workable, all heroes being viable in competitive tournaments and more expanded options for spectating, viewing games and analysing replays and statistics that aficionados would love.2015:Over the course of a year, Dota 2 has slowly introduced its Source 2 game client, which allows for easier integration of custom games similar to the original system of Warcraft 3's Battle.net. The International 2015 tournament is also a huge success and has a record $18.4 million, of which $16.8 million were contributed by community spending. Valve has also revealed its future plans for the game in the form of quarterly Majors tournaments that is meant to further develop its competitive scene and community interest.It is also clear that Dota 2 will be taking a seasonal games events approach towards stimulating community support, with obvious targets being December Holidays, Chinese New Year and Halloween. With regards to porting over Dota 1's legacy, there are only 2 heroes left: Arc Warden and Pitlord; and they are likely to be introduced with the aforementioned games events.At this point, the longevity of Dota 2 is very much secured in the foreseeable future due to Valve's Steam Client storefront, massive player base and successful implementation of cosmetic item sales that do not affect gameplay.Icefrog, you did the right thing by choosing to work with Valve for Dota 2's future back in 2010. I hope that you continue to work on your legacy and enjoy the feelings of joy, happiness, rage, sadness and comradery that you have brought to millions of people worldwide.2014:Dota 2 just keeps improving over time. At the rate this game is progressing, it is likely that it will still be around 5-10 years later. The community keeps expanding and the content updates are constant and full of exciting new features. Seasonal events bring about new quests and co-op gameplay that make good use of the core game's heroes' abilities. The cosmetic items economy is healthy and ever booming with more and more workshop artists contributing. As a competitive game oriented towards esports, Dota 2's professional scene has certainly expanded exponentially and The International's prizepool over the years can be seen as an indicator. It has grown exponentially from $1.6 million in 2012, to $2.9 million in 2013 and is projected to hit $10 million in 2014.Dota 2 has also recently implemented Ranked Matchmaking, which allows players the opportunity to play games for an ELO-style rating. While it has exploits and flaws at its debut, the subsequent updates over time have vastly improved the experience. It is a welcome new feature and it enables players interested in a more competitive experience to play to their best abilities, knowing that their teammates and opponents will likely put in the same amount of effort.2013:Valve Inc. has proven that they will continue to support Dota 2 in all aspects and maintain a healthy esports scene. The game caters to all spectrums of players, be it casual, competitive or spectator.Matchmaking system still has its design flaws and the game still lacks a way to convey to competitive players their skill level and standings/ratings.2012:Dota 2 requires huge player investment, but provides magnificent and immeasurable rewards for commitment.http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/08/21/dota-2-pt1/Now free to play! All heroes are free and available. Items are available for purchase for each individual hero, they do not affect the game balance at all as they are purely cosmetic, and the colors and items fit Dota 2's medieval setting.2011:This is a game for the competitive PC gamers. DOTA 2, the sequel to DotA features better character animations, mechanics, graphics and interface design. The ease of matchmaking, connecting with your friends and playing a cooperative team game all culminate together to make DOTA 2 a complete game experience. No two games are the same and despite this game still being in beta, it is already a great experience akin to other AAA PC games out there. This game is a definite buy for me. What will it be for you?",1

1099,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"Looking for a new card game after Hearthstone, Magic Duels and Magic online, i tried Shadowverse.Starting out in the game you are rewarded with plenty new cards to try out, which is good. I jumped into ranked mode and tried playing other players. I discovered that (at the lowest level of the scale), I was only playing against decks filled with rare and legendary cards. Since i had no cards like these, i obviously had no chance at winning. With 20 years of playing diverse collectible card games, it is my opinion that i can build a decent deck with the cards provided.The game is is fairly simple in its mechanics. Easy to understand. If you are looking for a more complex game like Magic the Gathering, this is not the game for you. If you like Heartstone but are fed up with Hearthstone's randomness, this might be a game for you.Pro's:+ Easy to learn+ Rewards plenty of cards at the start of the game+ Logging in daily rewards you with some ingame items.Con's:- Probably needs some financial investment to be competitive- expensive cards overwhelmingly powerful- animations take too much time if you want to quit a match and start over.

17923,Dungeon Defenders II,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI liked the first Dungeon Defenders a lot. It's one of the most played games on my Steam account. I've only played a little bit of the sequel so far, but man, I am struggling to find any enjoyment in it.  The structure is mind-boggling. The focus on online/social taverns, extremely limited quick match options with no server browser, having to load back into the tavern in between every map in the campaign? What are the developers thinking? Forcing everyone to be online all the time and giving us no control over who we match up with leads to every game being half full of afk players or max level characters who are wiping the floor with the low level maps for some reason.At least when playing solo in a private game, I finally get to stop and look at the maps and use some strategy. But even then if I exit out of a map and try to do another one, I run into errors saying that I have made too many matchmaking attempts recently and to wait a few minutes. Can't even play the game alone. Thanks Trendy.I cannot recommend this game at all in its current state. If a loot and stat-based tower defense/action game sounds appealing to you, I would highly suggest playing the first game instead.",0

8827,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"This Review isn't really long, very simple just spaced out by category, go ahead and expand it and enjoy.*Warning: Plebs on the forums are ragers with little patience and lack propper understanding of the games mechanics.Website for practicing Class Progression (Too many ragers crying because they dont know how to google helpful things!) =>>> http://www.tosbase.com/tools/skill-simulator/  The game is a solid, having that said, it is in its early phases and the company is patching it constantly before its initial release.Review:[Gamplay and Performance]- Over all, its clean cut, killing monsters is very satisfying, leveling up is not a chore. The Questline is a story you experience and is very enjoyable. The game is very engaging and there are lots of bosses to fight in the game. The gameplay is simple its easy enough for beginners to start playing RPG games yet complicated enough for the competetive player to have the resources they need , to go far PVE and PVP wise.[Visuals and Music]- Have you ever played, "" Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicals"", some time in your life? The visuals and initial feel of the game has a very artistic and familiar feel to FFCC, it's very pleasant and very fitting. The Art style used in the game can be very compelling and give you sense of peace and then do a 180 and pump you up with great Power Metal Electro beats when doing a dungeon. It's hard not to be moved by the game on your first time playing it.[Game Mechanics] The game is a meta breaker, it changes the way you view class progression as a whole, usually class progression is linear But this game is very diverse. Slapping down money on the game can be a nice little luxury but is not required it is entirely just for your own pleasure.[Consistency] The game dose a good job making it easy when you start off but then progresses to become a bit more difficult.

7613,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014.0," I don't speak English really well, so try to understand what is implied.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Review Counter-Strike is a series of multiplayer FPS games, where two teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, battle for a specific mission. The game was initially a mod for Half-Life, Valve's first game, until the sequels of the game were created some time later.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the latest game of the series, and today it is the most-popular competitive FPS game ever played. The game is just basically the same as the first Counter-Strike games, but a ton of additions and improvements were done.  Graphics First, the graphics. This is probably the biggest improvement in the series, as the game now looks more pleasing to the eyes, it has smooth movements throughout the game, and there has been a lot of decal improvements. Compared to the earlier games, Global Offensive provides a better and player-friendly nature thanks of today's modern graphics.Of course all of these cannot be achieved if you don't have the requirements to play on a flawless gameplay, but it is believed that it can run even on entry-level PC's.  Gameplay Gameplay. As I have said before, Global Offensive is mostly the same as the earlier games, consisting of the two game modes Bomb Scenario, wherein Terrorists must plant a bomb to a bomb site in a map and the Counter-Terrorists must defend or defuse the bomb if planted, and Hostage Scenario, wherein Counter-Terrorists must rescue hostages held by Terrorists.Though there are additionals game modes that can be played. These modes are the Arms Race, Demolition, and Deathmatch. (although I believe these modes can be played on the previous games through a mod)Global Offensive also made changes to the gun system, they have added more guns to the shop and made improvements to them.The sound is still the same as the previous ones, however, around this year they have made changes to the guns' sounds, But the sound from Global Offensive is a lot better and clear than the others. Community The community is what most Valve games' community have. There isn't really much to say here, although it's worth mentioning that the community on this game series is actually more friendly and cooperative than other Valve's games. And since this a competitive game, (I'd say highly competitive), a lot of players are pretty serious on playing since this involves a huge amount of cooperation with the team.Toxicity is somewhat not that visible to the game, so players who are really serious about competitive games are present. Miscellaneous Like DOTA 2 and Team Fortress 2, Valve's other popular games, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has also what they call the inventory system. Here you can get item drops such as gun skins, gun stickers, and cases where you can get the gun skins and stickers. These items can be used to customize your gun loadout, or sell them to the Steam Market, where you can get money from. (If you are lucky, there are rare items which have high price on the market listings where you can sell those rare items for $$$.) Final Notes Overall, this game is one of the best games out there, for a cheap price, and offers a lot of opportunities to choose how you want to play the game. You could try making yourself into the game and go for the rankings, play casually to pass time, or probably to troll just to relieve stress and have fun for yourself. There is a lot of space for you to improve in the game, but still, like most multiplayer game does, playing this game with friends give the best possible experience and gameplay for the game.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not a pay-to-win game, and if you wanted to spend money on this game, make sure you just make it worth the money you spend on the game.-----------Definitely get this game if you want to get started on competitive gaming, or if you're just looking for a game that is worth the time and money spending. In fact, the most annoying and irritating things that could occur in the game is actually the most hilarious and most fun to deal with.Counter-Strike is a really popular game, so why not just get the game, and shoot down other players and join the fun?",1

16570,Fractured Space,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewEven though it's in alpha and many features haven't been added yet, this is an incredibly fun game.The graphics are good, the ships are (mostly) balanced, and the game is determined by player skill and teamwork, meaning that you can play many matches on the one map currently (23 Apr. 2015) available and have a different experience every time.The different ships each have distinctly different playstyles, meaning that just about everyone can find something he likes.I enjoyed it so much during the free weekend that I bought one of the packs to support the devs, even though those of us who played during the weekend got to keep the game for free. I highly recommend it.",1
1194,Dungeon Defenders II,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe original Dungeon Defenders was likely one of the best executions of an integration between FPS and Tower Defense that the marketplace has seen.  I managed to clock a substantial quantity of hours into the original game, and it was an absolute blast to play.And then they started monetizing the game.  DLC became incredibly commonplace for addons.  New Heroes, new levels, new cosmetics, new character skins, anything they could think of.  They never directly monetized 'power', however, with the introduction of new levels with a higher level cap, it was an indirect way of power-capping new players.The other concern out of the implementation on the original Dungeon Defenders is that as new content got released, there was a substantial amount of Gear Inflation.  +500 to a given stat, which was godly at release, was trivial a few months later.  It had a much more MMO-esque grind to the game that drove their monetization strategy.Then we come to Dungeon Defenders 2.  When I look at this game, I realize that there were a lot of underlying engine upgrades, tons of texture updates, and they completely revamped multiple parts of the game... However, it's different enough from the original.  A lot of rehashed abilities, the same/familiar characters, etc.  The strength behind Dungeon Defenders 2 is that they have a better grasp of their monetization model going into it, and it's built that way from the ground up.  The reason Dungeon Defenders 2 is so popular right now is because it's still at it's infancy.  But even incredibly early on in the process, it really appears to be taking the same path at the original game, but by 'resetting' everything, they're opening the door for more monetization opportunies.  In my opinion, there hasn't been substantial innovation into this game to necessitate the high price tag, or recommend this game to anyone that has already enjoyed the original Dungeon Defenders.  It satisfies the same basic FPS-Tower Defense itch that can be scratched by cheaper alternatives in a more complete state.  This is much less a Dungeon Defenders 2, so much as it's a substantial overhaul of the original Dungeon Defenders.",0

Cheats are a method of cheating or exploiting game using scripts or taking advantage of information received but not displayed to the client. From what I understand, he continues to write cheats in order to ruin other emulators and bring a larger player base to his version. I think this is sort of scummy to do, but I also think it's smart. I respect intellect and you definitely earned my respect. I've been playing this emulator since it got an official steam release, I've racked up ~250 hours so far and I can gladly say I enjoy this game. But I will say, if you've never played a version of this engine you will most likely hate every moment of it. Unless you have friends who can teach you the ropes you're in for a rough time. For a free video game, I've spent about 20 dollars on micro-transactions so I could have a different player model and a few skins that I thought looked nice. Did it give me an advantage over any other players? No.If you're truly looking for a free PvP game where the essential idea is to take gear from other player's GI and put it in yours.As long as the current developers continue to improve the game, reduce cheaters, and the player base remains... I will continue to play NewZ.  ",1

1534,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is a lot of fun. It is rather generous for those who are free-to-play. One can amass a nice sum of cards quite painlessly. As far as card games go, this is in the same vein as Magic: The Gathering. I can't tell you how much I enjoy it simply for that alone. Eternal actually has some depth to it, and skill comes into play much more often than RNG does. Perhaps best of all, you can try this game completely free and get plenty of cards to use in countless ways in various decks. It's really all up to your imagination, as far as deckbuilding goes. And even without tons of legendaries you can make any sort of homebrew deck that still has a competitive edge to it. Not top-tier obviously, but still good enough to play competitively and, most importantly, have fun.That's the keyword here: FUN. Can you honestly say that Hearthstone is still fun? Look yourself in the mirror and try telling yourself that Hearthstone is still fun. It's okay if you start crying. That only means the healing can finally begin.",1
4372,School of Dragons,2015.0,"Now let's just be clear here. I like this game, but I don't recommend it, because I don't think many others would. You see, I don't really care what I do in a game. I could just be walking around and I would enjoy it. But that's pretty much all there is to this game. Just walking around, a few fetch quests to do, nothing much. There isn't even a story, just getting a dragon and, perhaps, growing some carrots. The game is full of monotonous, repetitive tasks that would leave most bashing their keyboard to kingdom come out of boredom. So, therefore I deeply suggest you do not download this game. And if you do, I will shed a tear if you spend money on it. Really.",0
3463,Black Squad,2018.0,"Early Access Review# TL;DR -> Down belowAfter 124 hours of gametime I thought I'll give my opinion on this game. I saw a few other reviews about how the game is ""garbage"" because it has loot boxes and has a lot of hackers. Let me just say this.: You get lootboxes for free, you get keys for free every month. If there's an event going on, you basically get a key everyday. I can't mention any other game that works like this and it's even free. About the ""hackers""... This game is easy to learn but hard to master, which brings this game to the point where you can be matched with skilled players even though you just started 2hours ago and don't even know how to run faster. Talking about the quick matches,  the game does have a decent matchmaking system though. Not every match is balanced, but I don't know any game that has a perfect balance system. Competitive matches are weird, coming from CS:GO I was pretty surprised that a lot of people get ""Eagle"" as their first rank... ofc depending on how you play, but it is the most common rank I would say. This rank has a lot of newbie players thus making it harder to rank up ( look at it like CS:GO Silver ranks ). Overall the gameplay is fluid. The game does have a few weird things like the reloading is weird at first ( you can shoot at 0 bullet, since the last bullet is already in the chamber and not in the mag ) I can't really say any negative about anything in this game. It's free, you can get easy skins which you can sell on the steam market. Try it. Play it. You won't regret it.TL;DR.# Pros:- CS:GO's and COD's secret son - Fluent gameplay- Customizable UI ( crosshair, 4:3 stretched, FOV, weapon FOV )- Skins ( with Steam Market support )- Free keys to open boxes- Events ( Halloween, Christmas, ... etc )- Daily ""Missions""- Never met a hacker.- Devs are on point.#Cons:- Weird ranking in competitive. ( Not a big problem )- Reloading ... When the mag is already inside the weapon it doesn't mean it is reloaded ( ofc when you don't have to♥♥♥♥♥♥the gun ) It is a bit delayed. You gotta get used to it.I switched from CS:GO ( ~1900 hours ) to this. And I'm happy I did.Thank you NS Studio, very cool!EDIT: Now the game has Voice chat, my life is complete.",1
2108,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"Updated as of 25. november - everything below still stands true and is still an excellent game.I'd like to spend a few moments on explaining the business model of this free to play title.TLDR: The business model of this free to play is solid, you can aquire anything non-cosmetic in the game by playing it, but by spending a few bucks you can increase the rate at which you can aquire the things you want.""First of I'd like to say that you can access ALL non-cosmetic items in the game without spending any real world currency by simply playing the game.As you are playing the game you get XP from doing pretty much anything relevant in the game, and for every 250xp you aquire 1 certification point ( these ""certs"" are the primary currency in the game which you will spend on anything that interest you, except cosmetics that can only be bought with real money ).However, we are now going to look at the things in the business model that are impefect compared to a completely fair free to play title;While a lot of the upgrades and things that impact your gameplay are only possible to aquire through certs, certain things can be alternatively bought by spending real money, such as weapons, weapon scopes, and possibly the soon to be implemented ""implants"". Also, you can purchase experience boosters using only real money that will for a limited time increase the amount of experience you gain while playing the game. Lastly there is the ability to pay a monthly subscription to the game similar to conventional MMO titles and this will cause you to recieve an experience boost as well, among other things.That been said, the starting equipment is all competetive, even in some cases regarded by many to be the best in slot for the experienced players as well.",1

20287,War Thunder,2016.0,"War Thunder is sadly one of the game i decided to quit after following it over a long time. Playing a few hundred hours non-steam and 243 hours on steam i can safely say that i am done with it. Ive been a beta tester for planes & tanks and have had experience with early gameplay and the final gameplay - very often not a big difference between those two.The flight part is very good, might be even one of the best free flight games on the market. You have an enormous amount of planes over various nations with let you play in a lot of different ways. Bomber, Dive Bomber, Torpedo Bomber, Fighters, Attackers, Jets [...]. The matchmaking is okay, depending on the game mode you are playing. You have the choice between Arcade, Realistic, Simulation. The names indicate how realistic each mode is. A huge flaw however is the huge grind it takes once you reach slightly higher levels. The sheer amount of planes which you need to research to reach a new tier is insane! I would still recommend this for casual players.The tank part is incredibly bad. Many problems with it were addressed during the closed beta, but were never resolved. The Dev's were spamming unnecessary updates for stuff that did not need to get fixxed. While they tried to be realistic they went overboard and got too realistic. Tanks being able to fire rounds which were incredibly rare during WW2? Hey, doesnt matter, lets fully load them with it! Now every tank is gonna be a one shot easy kill. Bugs over bugs made this hugely anticipated game mode unplayable. Overall i do not recommend this game. The grind is just too strong and the overwhelming amount of bugs and problems within the game is too problematic.",0
14843,Crush Crush,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewEarly Access Watcher Reviews Crush Crush!Update Version: 0.32Disclosure: This is a free to play game with heavy micro-transactions (will explain)I have never been one to believe in the meaning behind the word free. In the grand scheme of things, nothing can be gained without first sacrificing something to achieve it. Free samples at a Costco or Sam's Club require a membership to enter the store, a free appetizer requires signing up for a rewards program, free miles with a credit card force you to get a credit card, and free to play games are held back by the ultimate sacrifice of time. Crush Crush is an example of a free to play game burdened with the sacrifice of time as everything needed to progress is held back behind a timer. There is a bit of offhand humor and some charming artwork on display, but the ultimate question relies on how much of a pay off it offers. Does this time sink give a memorable journey into the building of a lovely relationship or simply trick the user into a guesswork of plausible worth?Art can be a matter of taste for any given individual. The character designs to the backgrounds used for inductions and dates are all rather well drawn with very little out of place distractions. Each scene has their own comedic approach on dates that fit the personality of their respected female and the animations used for hobbies and jobs are a wonderful touch. The music is limited and can get old quickly, but the sound effects are downright grating (especially during the first few relationship levels with the girls when you need to click them to progress.) It shows effort and is pleasing to the eye, which is good considering how long you will be seeing them.The madness begins by meeting your first girl and cookie clicking her to the point she forgives you. Each girl has to be wooed through several relationship levels by meeting certain requirements from hearts gained (either by clicking chat, the girl or over time if you have the right hobby leveled) to gifts and dates spent on them. Upon reaching one of the three landmarks, you are rewarded with a picture of the character. Honestly, the reward for sinking so much time into this game is not that great, but it does let you level while not playing.You also need to level hobbies and jobs (all over time) to meet certain requirements. Money is generated by the jobs and each time you are paid the job progresses until you are promoted. Hobby levels unlock new jobs and also help unlock new girls to woo. Both have a certain amount of time needed to progress, but you can reset the current game to increase the time multiplier and decrease the amount of time needed to progress. Time blocks are also unlocked when you level up a relationship or job to a certain point which allows you to level more jobs and hobbies at the same time. If it really was this simple, I would have given the game a recommendation for being free and plausible to complete; I then found out the system is rigged.A free to play game can manage the balance between micro-transactions and time vs reward, but in this case the balance is not achievable. The in-game store uses diamonds (which you are limited to without purchasing them with real money) to increase the speed multiplier, increase time slots for jobs and hobbies and to skip time ahead by 4 hour to 7 days. Right now the multiplier increase from resetting the game is locked at 64x and to increase it further requires real money, which is never mentioned in the game. Time blocks are also limited without using real money and that is never mentioned either. I cannot begin to explain how much time is needed to raise a hobby past 30, let alone 40 and 50 without the use of a multiplier increase. This makes it quite improbable to even reach the eleventh girl's max relationship status (outside the fact you need diamonds to do it) in a reasonable amount of time. This creates a feeling many describe as ""time dilemma"" (I grew victim to it on Eve Online with the skill injects to erase waiting time for skills to level) that can make people flee to the in-game store to buy diamonds in order to complete the game. It is bad enough this gap exists, but the developer should have disclosed the limitations on their store page.Micro-transactions will always be a delicate topic in regards to games. I have grown to accept them in free to play games that are not in beta/early access and even MMOs when they offer cosmetic or pet/mount value. This game, however, does not disclose the free to play and pay to win gap it has created using the ultimate payment of time. I actually like the artwork for this game and thought some of the jokes, albeit dated, were chuckle worthy, but this is all pushed to the side when the micro-transactions rear their head. I cannot in good faith recommend this product and plead with the developer to disclose the limitations out of respect to the consumer. I will check back on this product later down the road and hope that my time then will not be put up for auction.Pros- Artwork and character models- Some enjoyable humor and clever charactersCons- Micro-transactions with undisclosed limitations- Sound effects can wear thin after awhile- Very little reward for the effort",0
6287,Digimon Masters Online,2017.0,"Pros:- Nostalgia- Digimon- constant game events- NOT p2wCons:-  very grindy- Poor english translationI reccomend this game if you like digimon, if you dont then this prolly isn't the game for you.The translations are pretty bad so the story is hard to understand and it's hard to figure out what all the items do.The entire game is grinding. Every quest. There might be one or two crafting based ones but that is it. Also this game is NOT p2w like many reviews say, you can get everything you can buy for cash with in game money or with grinding with the exception of a few costumes which dont affect game play.Edit: People commenting about this game being PTW on my review. You need to learn what a PTW game is. Offering in game purchases does not make a game PTW. Especially when the items you can purchase you can also get in game. PTW games offer things for sale that nonpaying users cant get themselves.",1

1606,Brawlhalla,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewRemember that time when you were playing a game and thought that ""this game needs a lot more mindless action and fighting"", so, now you have it, and you don't even need to pay for it!! Review:Legends       The legends have repetitive weapons, but each one of them have their own unique skills with them, but unfortunally there as always those guys spamming spear rotation to not let you get back in the arena. The Legends are completly free-o-money, you just need to play A LOT to buy the one you want. The Game has a Weekly rotation of Legends so you can play with 'em all without even buying them.Arenas      The arenas are kinda simple, with some of them that actually has some feature or other. The game itself got kinda of 7-8 arenas, but they all could get an upgrade and new features. All the arenas are spear-spamming friendly, but with the right momentum, you can just tell the sheethead to go away with a punch in his head. Skins      The game gives you the oportunity to have all the Legends with only playing the game, but the skins, just with Mammoth Coins, translating, real cash. I kinda think this is good, because you will only buy the ones you like for the ones you play, but there should be another way to get them, not like CSGO with crates and sheet, but kinda a presential month listing, that if you get all days ingame, you could trade for a skin, buuuut thats just me.Gameplay      Consist of the 'Couch', the 'Single Player', the 'Online' and the 'Ranked'. The cool part of them all is not that you just play by yourself, this game brings back the good 'ol same-screen co-op gameplay, meaning, you can add more than 1 player in one PC, for me, this is actually awesome. The game consist in killing everybody else in the arena, be it in teams or F4A (Free-For-All). All Legends have 2 weapons, and can still just brawl their brains out with their fists.End:     For all of you whom are reluctant to play this, i shall tell you: LETS FREAKING EXPLODE THEIR BRAINS WITH FREAKING MASSIVE ROCKET SPEARS!!!9.5/10 ",1

It runs more smoothly then the base game you download from Wargaming Sites. Steams WoWs has around 30-60+ fps. WoWs you download from the site only has around 20-30 fps. This game is great. But the only thing that is medicore about the game is the playerbase. The playerbase can be sometimes hostile to new players, critisizing them for picking a branch of a fleet they deem ""sucky and trash"". Be prepared to be called degenerate or metally challenged words. Other wise the game itself is 8/10 on my part.

13103,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewLots of strategy and tactics and a lot more as this game develops. I play a ton of WoT and this is more involved in your strategy and tactics options. I would recommend the short tutorial, then go to the firing range for a few minutes, then do the tutorial again, and then jump into the game. There is a match making rating system to try to keep balance and have new players with new players. You can fly with friends, you can have your own test matches against friends.  Currently there are issues with matchmaking struggling to put together games, so the two minute wait can sometimes be more like 5 minutes. The game is much more about playing than grinding. I put my money on it to support it, and thus far it is not pay to win. Games can last 20 minutes and the action ratchets up as you get bonuses built up. The win or loss as the players get more experienced can almost be a surprise - you thought you had more time, or you didn\'t evade and get to where you were needed. Watch the videos on the starter ships also.  Definitely worth a try, and coming back to again and again as they finish polishing it.

13420,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access Review*WARNING*This is my first review so it is probably garbage and I probably use too many examples, but tell me how I did. Here is a TL;DR version: it is OK to frustrating real quick Pay-To-Have-Fun Controls oddly and bugs when you don’t want it to Needs to be flushed out more Needs a catch-up mechanic The loot crate system is total BS Play with friends for 3 days with free premium, then uninstall the game Honestly, only open this game if you can play non-stop with 2-3 friends nonstop for the free premium length. This game makes you laugh, feel epic, and you can really bond with friends with this game. But it gets shallow quick.Here are the problems:“Premium”As you guess, you need to pay for this. It is a bit, but you get a free 3 day trial when you offer up your email. Nothing too bad on the surface, but you can see how it can get bad on the surface.I climbed levels way faster than my friend who couldn’t get premium to work, you get more loot (More on this later), and the game just became easier. You would have noticed free earlier. It is paid and not always that good. Prices can get a bit expensive. Since you have to build your vehicle there are 2 limited factors: Your level cap and your parts. You get twice as much paying and you level more so you can use all your shinny things quickly. It handicaps the people that are free. It is not Pay-To-Win but more of a Pay-To-Have-Fun.GameplayHonestly, kinda loose at times but it is ok. As someone use to PC shooters, the A and D rotating instead of moving is weird. It can get into a lot of stumbling which is nothing something you want when someone sneaks up with a giant shotgun and is about to fire. Shooting though drove me nuts. I really liked being a spider with 2 large rail guns and harass the flying people. But when you are point at a plane coming at you, it is shooting lasers, and you line up a shot, click, and NOTHING! It gets infuriating. I zoom out to see that my rail gun as accidently shot the ground, or my armor, or they might have been shot off already, or the worse thing ever is no reason. Now in the game they only let you get together with 3 friends if you are free, or 4 if you are premium. I thought it was strange until I realized why. A good fun bit of the game is fighting in hectic chaos. But when 3 friends get together, they can just march to your base and wreck you. (This is why I suggest playing with friends)When your base is getting assaulted, you need to head back to make sure you don’t lose. Then more enemies come and harass, then more, then more, and you die and have to wait for sometimes over a minute to spawn, defend, die, wait to respawn, and then watch your base explode. You feel hopeless.I feel 2 mechanics are at work. 1) There is no catch up system so if you start losing; chances are you are going to lose.2) It feels like they take a page from heart stone and try to make your wins to losses 50/50This leads to your team face stomping when you do really nothing and you working your♥♥♥♥♥off to see everything fall apart no matter how good you play.Ow, and there is no reporting players so you get some cleaver cheaters.LOOT SYSTEMSo my friend played this a while ago (Marco, if you are reading this, Hi) he told me of an age with cockpits, in-game currency, and planes not sucking at controls. He didn’t like the new loot system at all and I didn’t see why at first. Now I do.Doesn’t matter if you are a free to play or paying, you get displayed with “Loot you get” and “Loot you would have gotten if you have paid!” after a game. There are different tiers of loot crates and other reviews go into more detail but it sucks.It is random. Someone can get a rare item in a silver crate while you get stuck with blocks and uncommon garbage in you diamond box. You can grind up items you don’t want into dust and “Forge” new things you do want from the shop. This is highway robbery at the exchanges they have. When your team wins, your score is doubled so you get better lot. So often times the worse player on the wining team will get more and better stuff then the best player who happens to lose. This can make a game where you got 11 kills, 2 deaths, and many assists to a bronze crate, AND THAT IS LUCKY! It is just still.If you made it this far, good for you! I would give you all the stuff I got, but no in game trading. (Which is a smart move really but you can figure that out) ",0
5980,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014.0,"Another game by the valve company, its the Counter Strike ! The game that we all should love.The competitive part of the gameplay is full with teamwork, skill and tactics, its nice that team with a leader (A guy that command his/her teamates via team chat or voice chat) will always win if they are against a team without a proper leader. Soo the teamwork in this game is very superb. All the weapons in this game is balanced, so no matter which gun you used, as long as you can used it, you can kill even an opponent with a more expensive gun than you, i see alot players with a 800$ weapon win against a players with a 5000$ weapon. And if you didn't like competitive you can have fun too with a Call of duty style team deathmatch, and free for all. Its really fun, all you need to do in this mode is to just kill the enemy, killing another players in this mode is really fun and a stress reliever.

8936,Magic Duels,2015.0,"Let me start by saying I've been enjoying this game allot, i've played all previous Magic duals/planeswalkers games and this one finally gives us online and collecting capabilities. It's comparable to Hearthstone which is another game i enjoy ""heartily"".Now unfortunly the final product feels a bit rushed, servers crash way to often; UI seems a bit old; No chat in online games, etc. I wish they spend another couple months developing. This game could have been a big hit if they polished/marketed it more but alas.All in all i give this a thumb up hoping patching will fix the servers/no chat options during online play.TL;DR, pros and cons:Pros:+Gold seems relatively easy to come by.+Good explaining of the game mechanics for people who never played Magic.+Deep gameplay, brain required.+Online capabilities (1v1 and 2v2).+Great singleplayer.+Almost no bugs (Didn't encounter one yet)Cons:-Server stability. (Hopefully updated soon)-Somewhat simplefied UI lacking in options. (I think they did this so it's easy to port to phones/tablets later on)-No chat/friends, online (Hopefully updated soon)",1

2350,Creativerse,2015.0,Early Access ReviewWhile this game is great considering its beta i feel that onve you hit the corruption level the exploration stops and theres nothing left to do but build. I would very much like to see several more layers added to the world each with its own unique bioms and materials you need to harvest to get to the next level below. Other than that i would very much encourage you to pick this game up soley for the multiplayer aspects like the free servers saved to steam so you can play on a friends server without them being online.10/10 would grief my friends again,1

The graphics and presentation are top notch and the sound design is incredible.Tier 1 co-op battles are pretty easy but it really does get more challenging once you get Tier-2 with torpedo ships.So yeah, it has a very nice bot mode so it's well worth looking at.

16813,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"Full disclaimer, I am not an FPS kind of guy. I don't have the twitch reflexes nor the situational awareness to do well in shooters. I usually get killed in the middle of trying to get a bead on the person who just head-shotted me. Having said all of that, and not having spent that much time with this game, I can confidently say that this is a good one. The visuals are pleasing and the interface is intuitive. To a noob like me, things can be a little overwhelming at first, but if you are fortunate enough to have a buddy who is a regular player to show you the ropes, it will greatly ease your introduction into the vast battleground in the game world. I like the use of vehicles as well as the character classes, though it does put me off that you can come back as a different class every time you die and respawn. I prefer a certain amount of investment and commitment in the class or role that I play. There is defintely fun to be had here, especially if you play as a part of a team of friends that you are used to playing with. And hey, it's free to play. If I was better at FPS, I'd definitely play this game regularly.",1

638,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016.0,"The game is a money pit filled with hackers. The rank system is a joke.Overwatch is a joke.VAC is a joke.There is no anti-cheat system for this game.It has a tired engine. (2004) Source engineIt's a game based off a skill game. Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update and break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke)Adding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever !  (Not)I know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots.They will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke !DM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen.After one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet.Random lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well.Could it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone  other then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow).Legit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people  hence people having so many accounts...I have 1 account and proud of it.I know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth.......By the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, The real money has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers.    "" I'll just save it"".If your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized.If you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded.....If you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played.If you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game.(1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!Once again another update this time destroying the most played map in CS. Nuke was bad enough. Old Nuke was great. New Nuke sux. Old Dust 2 great. New Dust 2 sux.You want to fix something fix the anti-cheat I mean put an anti-cheat so the game can be enjoyed.For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours.I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players.If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do.And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore.......As soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!""I never leave a friend or a man behind"" (In other words I don't bail on my friends)After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system ""Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money""  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played !This game would be great........ There is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old. But 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman. No one gets banned. Hackers will say ""I heard you"" or it's ""my smurf"". In any case if your Global and on another account and play as a global on a nova account then your a cheater and a scumbag.The Facts and nothing but the facts........!

12681,Fractured Space,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewI really enjoyed my first match of this game! It reminds of me Star Conflict meets League of Legends. Capture the points, kill the enemy, capture the main base! Super fun, very colorful and pretty intense.",1
15217,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFor once an actual good BR game and its not so demanding like all the others that are being mainstreamed at the moment.I can find myself playing this a lot, solo or with friends.

6899,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis Free2Play Battle Royale has won me over. It has snowboarding, hand gliding, mountain climbing and ziplining! You can join a squad of up to 4 players, play duo or solo, pick your spawning point on the grid based map and your package of choice (snowboard/handglider/climber). Your objective is to survive the harsh cold. You will be pushed around the map by a blizzard which will black out certain regions of the map which are randomly chosen so that no match can be predicted beforehand. Eventually, there will be but one small space remaining, and the numbers of players will have dwindled thin to all but the strongest and most evasive survivalists. In these last moments before the blizzard completely engulfs the map, the players have to fight for their seats aboard the escape helicopter. Teams will be at eachother's throats at this point as they all struggle to climb the ladder, praying that they aren't killed before comfortably claiming their seat. One time I had almost claimed my seat and about 1 second before sitting down, I was sniped. It was agonizing, yet the thrill this game delivers me in moments like that are just plain addictive. When you DO finally escape the blizzard, that feeling of accomplishment is definitely there. My fondest moment thus far was when my friend and I had both taken down 2 people each who had us cornered down in a 3 floor building. The entire building was up in smoke, and it was like a Call of Duty Modern Warfare campaign. It was intense, and as soon as I saw the silhouette of a person I unloaded with my Origin 12 shotgun. Their buddy made the mistake of rushing to their aid and I downed him too. We both were the last 2 players standing in the game and we claimed our seats and triumphantly escaped. I've had many more satisfying experiences like this one and I could sit and name more but then this review would be absurdly long, so let me just conclude by saying that the Early Access title Ring of Elysium is a game you will have a blast in, and to me it feels like multiple games in one. If you have friends, play with them, it will only enhance the experience tenfold.I highly recommend Ring of Elysium with a 9/10 and it is one of the few Free2Play games worth playing.",1

12202,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,"The short answer is, it's holding up very well. The core action pits two teams of players against each other in a battle to capture points, move a cart, or steal a briefcase. The objective is always very straightforward; it's the interplay between the nine playable classes that makes things so varied and interesting. The speedy scout, the militant heavy, the diligent engineer, the conniving medic, the pesky sniper, the sneaky spy, the feisty pyro, the explosive soldier, and the even-more-explosive demoman all have unique weapons, attributes, and abilities that complement each other and clash in myriad ways. Encounters can vary widely depending on the match type and the makeup of each team, and this unpredictability is crucial to TF2's long-standing appeal.When you come out of the gate as a heavy with a medic in tow, you're a formidable offensive force, but if a spy loops around to backstab the medic and you round the corner on a pyro, it can all come undone in a matter of seconds. Snipers can cover expected enemy paths, but rocket-jumping soldiers have a knack for finding alternative routes and raining explosive death from above. You may think you have a comparatively weak scout dead to rights, only to be stunned by a baseball and beaten to death. As you watch your giblets splatter on the ground and see a freeze-frame of your gleeful killer, it's hard not to chuckle at the sheer variety of ways you can meet an untimely demise. And the humorous quips, ridiculous outfits, and histrionic announcer help cultivate this lighthearted tone.Of course, this core dynamic has persisted for most of TF2's life span, so if you stopped playing it a few years ago and come back for a few matches, you'll find things are very familiar. Learning the ropes and getting the hang of your chosen role is still a gratifying experience, and mastering advanced techniques doesn't just make you deadlier; it gives you more options for how to approach combat. Keeping your options open is still valuable too, because being flexible with your choice of character can help you avoid ending up on a catastrophically imbalanced squad. It is Team Fortress, after all.But though there is much that has remained constant about the core game, there have been some notable changes over the years, as well as regular infusions of new weapons and items. Of the hundreds of things available in the online store, some can be unlocked through play, while others must be purchased with actual money. From small doodads that cost less than a dollar to massive bundles that cost hundreds, there's a wide range of ways to customize your experience.Many of the items offer nothing more than a playful twist on the game's already cheeky cartoon aesthetic. You can buy hats, shirts, shoes, and other cosmetic gear to dress up like a character from Adult Swim or don spooky seasonal garb that you can wear only during Halloween or a full moon. Even if you don't fancy shelling out for any of this stuff, it's fun to see some visual variety as you try to light your opponents on fire.Other weapons have more of an impact, like the ones that give your character a new chargeable and expendable power. The scout can build hype, which turns his usual double jump into a triple, quadruple, or quintuple jump, and the soldier can build rage, which allows him to rally his nearby teammates to do extra damage. Skills like these have more of a meaningful impact on the action, bringing something new to the table that your enemies must contend with. And then there are the totally out-there loadouts, like the one that turns the grenade-launching demoman into an extra from the movie Braveheart.In addition to the cosmetic options, there are a lot of weapons and items that offer small buffs or subtle tweaks to your attributes. Depending on which healing gun the medic equips, for example, he can imbue himself and his targeted ally with extra damage resistance or enable himself to match the speed of his target. Differences like these don't do much to change the core action, but they do give experienced players substantial room for strategic variation.These options broaden the field of viable strategies, which helps keep combat lively and varied. And fortunately, none of the purchasable weapons or items tip the scales unfairly towards those willing to pay. Buffs and bonuses usually come with caveats, and the weapons that bestow new abilities are usually unlocked for free. For this review, I spent some money on goofy hats and some of the stranger weaponry on offer, like the pyro's flamethrower that actually shoots bubbles and rainbows. It was fun to play with the new gear, but I still found myself switching my loadout between free and paid weapons regularly to adapt to the match situation.Very very fun game, I highly suggest everyone come try it! After all, it's free!",1
11224,Creativerse,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAbsolutely LOVE this game. It's great to play with your friends, and I even play with my 6 year old son!

It's great that you have control over this. Love the fact that you have to look for the materials you need to be able to craft your items, and one thing that got me hooked is how positive the fans are in this community, and especially how fun, creative, and interactive the devs are!

The reasons that you can get kicked in competitive matches are so immature and sad that it's become a serious problem:1.Ofc if you have the lowest score in the first 4 rounds they won't hesitate to vote kick you (even if your score is just 1 or 2 below theirs)2.If you have the least amount of kills.

Future quests grow with you, and become some of the most memorable times played in the game, and are just tough enough to leave you wanting more.I can't go on enough without spoiling the whole thing for you, but as a HUGE Tolkein fan, and for those that aren't, it is hands down the best Medieval/Reneissance/Dark Ages/Fantasy MMORPG that is out there.",1

The game needs money to survive and become more developed, it's not like the game could be successful if no one bought anything and everything was free.

6920,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewOkay I have been playing this game for a little less than a month and I genuinely enjoyed it. Its mechanics were really nice, animations were smooth and gmaeplay was really fun. I could also play this on my junk computer at good framerates. It was essentially a really well made free-to-play PUBG clone and I loved it. As of late though, not so much. As to what me and a few friends refer to as the ""Fortnite"" update its not so interesting and just becomes another battle royale game. Previously it was more like PUBG with getting credits for kills and getting boxes for cosmetics. Some friends and I would try to get strategic cosmetics that would help us blend in with the environment and stuff of the sort. With the ""Fortnite"" update it has introduced 'Seasons' and taken away the customizability. I had a decent looking character and tons of cosmetics, but now they are all gone. They instead added what they did with Fortnite and with the seasons you unlock different looking characters and cosmetics for gameplay and added a paid ""Adventurer's Pass"" to gain more. I am saddened by this choice from the devs and all the progress I had stripped from me and my friends. This started out as a really nice free to play PUBG clone and is turning into a Fortnite clone.",0
16328,Trove,2016.0,"I played this game during Beta, and recently got it on Steam, when it came out it was an insanely great game, fun dungeons, always something to do, something new to grind towards without being to hard. Now you can grind for hours, upon hours and not even get close to what you want. The new gem system was good in theory, but was executed poorly, classes now cost real money to get, really takes away from the excitement. Making everything untradable has made it hard for new players to get a grip on things that maybe they can't farm, or just dont want to spend hours farming. The lag has become almost unbearable, Beta had little lag, now I can't climb a dungeon without rubber banding back down, its frustrating. Overall If this game was its former self. and easy 10/10 but now its a 2/10.",0

One is that it gets so repetitive its fun for an hour but then the enemys just stop being uniqe all you do is mash to win.

In battles, you get ingredients that are used for ""cooking"" new suites, masks, gestures, tombstones and other cosmetic items that don't influence your combat effectiveness. You can also purchase optional ""kitchen pass"" that increases rewards per battle and unlocks additional recipes.The most honest system for Loot Boxes: Those are scattered around the battlefield, and are free to open, their content is well labelled, and the drop chance of what is said to be inside is a 100% guarantee.Fair play: you can play Cuisine Royale in first and third person view. In order to mitigate advantage of the latter, every player has a minion with a camera that can uncover the position of a player who is peeking around a corner. So if you see a butterfly or a drone - you should know that you are being watched.Massive and intense battles: 34 players per session in total will head out from different parts of the map, starting only in their underwear and making their way to the center of a battlefield that is constantly shrinking in size.Amazing",1

The game modes are diverse and the massive character roster (91 ATM I think?) keeps you from getting too bored. I feel I should note that the God Pack for this game is 100% worth it, as you'll get every character released as they come out, which is a huge value. At the very least, give the game a try!",1

There was a HUGE update (that some poeple weren't happy about, I'm okay with it) last week and development shows NO sign of stopping. We get teased all the time, and the devs are super friendly/stream multiple days per week.No other game has gotten me into the development process like this, I love it!

I love Valve. I've been here for 15 years on steam, and pre-date steam with the first Counter-Strike. And with that being said, Valve needs to stop ignoring the community and start talking to us. This update? Free-to-play? Battle Royal?! It's far from anything anyone from /r/csgo or /r/valve ever would have asked for. We constantly ask for updates other Valve titles like TF2 and we get silence. This game was the best FPS i've ever played, and now it's something completely different. The competitive nature of it originally turned into something much more toxic and tainted. Loot crates were added, making the game feel based on weath, and the more and more people got crates the more they felt superior to others. People turned on other people making it such a toxic environment, and the competitivity grew and grew. Hackers were always a problem, and Valve was only minute on the subject. And if you want to know the brutally honest truth, it's that I still love this game. But with a sane mind, I can't reccomend it.",0

Constant upgrades are nice, with a good community of players. Since I have started playing, 2 new characters have been added (and more are still on the way), new maps, weapons, armor, and pets have been added.My only complaint with the game is that the story mode ends fairly quickly (about 10 hours of gameplay), then it cycles back through all the maps again on a harder difficulty. Therefore making it a bit repetative to play consistantly. That being said, I still do enjoy playing the game and would recommend it to others.",1
18830,Minion Masters,2018.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewFantastic game for the first 10 hours or so. But then it quickly becomes more and more frustrating as you fine tune your deck and realize this is just another version of the old rock paper scissors gameplay. There are not very many cards and the standard ""meta"" type gameplay. Balance does not seem to matter in games anymore. There is this illusion of skill, but in reality you are just kinda watching some graphics flash around your screen until someone wins. You can EASILY predict who that winner will be within the first 10-15 seconds of gameplay, as once the upper hand is gained the game is over *shrug*I LOVE the concept and idea of this game and hopefully as it develops further it will improve, but as it stands right now it's way fun at first, as you climb the league ladder though.....be ready to lose every time to someone that has either spent money on it or has played much longer than you. Nothing you do can change it either....as there is very little skill involved with this type of game. Thanks for the free copy though! I bought another copy for my 12 year old son *shrug*",1

16675,Magic Duels,2016.0,"Product received for freeMagic Duels is good way to introduce someone to Magic: the Gathering (MTG), but it doesn't hold up when you are looking for a complete emulation of the real game.Reasons why I don't recommend this game:Doesn't actually implement all the MTG rules, no post-draw discarding here, folks. It crashes on startup occasionally, specifically when you try to do other things while it's loading. It crashes while in the campaign too, this happened twice to me, at the same point no less. You earn 30 game credits every time you win a match against another player, you buy a 6 card pack for 150 credits.  So you are earning 1 and 1/5th cards every time you win...Until you unlock good cards you are going to be playing pauper and getting beat by anyone with more cards and a structually better deck.No sideboarding, so you have to mainboard enchantment removal if you don't want to get Pacifism'd to death.The music is lacking, and repetitive.  Don't be surprised if it gets stuck in your head when you are trying to sleep.Some cards don't behave correctly.  My Disciple of the Ring refused to tap down their flying 5/5 which nearly cost me the match.  This is surprising and irritating since you know your strategy should work but it doesn't want to because they didn't do enough QA in development.You can't chat with other players, this could be considered a plus since some people are toxic (they always are, in competitive games) but I do not.On the flip side: It's free.It's MTG.If you want to play MTG for free, just go play it on LackeyCCG, XMage, or Cockatrice.",0

564,Bless Online,2018.0,"So, not all that many minutes on record and I'll explain why: After having relaunched the game four times (litterally) I realised that the reason I couldn't press any buttons is that the mouse pointer is actually 2 cm below the one on the screen, probably due to the game launching in windowed mode. However, this very simple issue hung on since the very clever guys put the options menues juuuust above the tool bar, so whenever I tried to press it it fell outside the game and I got to look at my lovely search bar.  But being the determined gamer that I am, I don't let something as trivial as not being able to press buttons and a terrible blurry page stop me, those things can be fixed later on.So I somehow managed to create a character and head into the game. Fix the windowed mode to get the mouse pointer back in place and the graphics back up so it doesn't look I'm constantly drunk, only to find to my annoyance that the font size is 2 and I have to look at my screen in a pose like I'm an old man just finding micro♥♥♥♥♥♥♥porn.Bye bye game.",0

1809,Crush Crush,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewShallow, but somewhat charming. The first part is a clicky time management game, as you click to talk to the girls and switch between hobbies and jobs. Eventually, though, you'll just be waiting to get enough money or skills to advance. At this point, you either pay real money to advance or just close the program and let the game play itself, as it accumulates money and skills offline, up to 7 days worth. There are some mildy interesting mechanics to speed up the game and avoid this, but they only go so far. Recommended if this type of game appeals to you, but just know what you're getting into. I'll probably finish the game out of compulsion, but I find it more annoying than fun.Minor improvement suggestion: Don't repeat what the girls say until you've cycled through their list, then just reshuffle the list. As it stands now they can say the same thing several times in a row.",0

Players also gain skills quickly, such as the ability to fly at level 5.  Basically, something new is achieved every few levels or so to keep the player interested.

3697,Star Trek Online,2013.0,"-As of November 21st of 2015, this review is woefully outdated. Be aware-Actually one of the more decent MMOs I've played. Strangely compelling.Even so, there basically is no endgame. Well, actually, there is, but the endgame really is just there for the sake of itself. You grind missions to get better gear to grind missions faster to get even better gear to grind the missions even faster, ad nauseum.Levelling up to endgame is fun but fast, and is really only there for the sake of getting you used to endgame, which the game still doesn't do extremely well. Skills in particular can be confusing to level.All in all it's a solid game with solid mechanics though, most of the powergaming bits can be ignored for the sake of its core gameplay, which is blowing theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥out of everything in a spectacular fashion. Not very up and coming of a Starfleet officer, I think, but as a Klingon or Romulan is definitely fitting.As for the IP, STO uses the Star Trek universe to its advantage and makes fans of the series feel right at home, while not alienating people who've never watched an episode of Trek in their lives. Even so, the aforementioned tonal contrast between the Starfleet of the shows and movies and the more Imperium of Man-style gung-ho militaristic Starfleet of this game can be jarring but still doesn't ruin the experience (for me at least).As for the Pay2Win question, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I have seen of the F2P monetization model. Everything the game gives you for free is more than viable for every single PVE confrontation in the game. Even so, getting the very good stuff is still free. Explaining STO's currencies and economy takes a while, but basically it goes like this: -Energy Credits are the GP of Star Trek Online. They're gained mainly from selling random loot you don't end up needing. They can be used at NPC vendors and the player exchange, which sells everything from high quality equipment to rare ships usually only acquirable from Lock Boxes or the Lobi Crystal Consortium (more on those later)-There's this stuff called Dilithium. It takes dedicated effort to grind for the unusable version, which is then converted to the usable version at a rate of 8000 daily. Dilithium is used to do pretty much everything endgame.-Zen is the paid currency. You buy it for $1.00/100 Zen. You buy advanced ships and other helpful sundries with it.-You can exchange Dilithium for Zen. Players buy Zen and want your Dilithium because they don't want to grind it themselves. You want their Zen because you don't want to buy it. You put your Dilithium up and offer it for Zen, and someone grabs it. Or vice versa. The economy of Dilithium/Zen exchange rates are dictated by supply and demand.-Lock Boxes (basically Mann Co. Supply Crates) can be opened with Master Keys, giving you a random goodie (sometimes an extremely good ship) and some Lobi Crystals. Lobi Crystals are bound to your account, but can be used to buy things on the Lobi Crystal Consortium, things like desirable equipment, advanced consumables, and even good ships. Master Keys are bought from the cash shop, which you can get the currency for by exchanging the grindable currency.Again, everything in the game can be gotten for free. If you have enough time you can have the best equipment in the entire game without ever paying a cent.All in all, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I've seen of an MMO doing things right. It had a rocky start, but has grown into a great game. I definitely recommend trying it, even if you don't really like Star Trek.",1

3298,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"The gameplay:It's a team-based game that uses different classes, and of course, like every FPS valve game, you have no iron sights (but can scope in with a sniper rifle). However, there are quite a few fun weapons and tactics you can use on this game, and every class is perfectly balanced. Neither class that you choose is nerfed or OP, so you can dominate the game with any of them. There's always going to be the pros who have 1000+ hours on this game that will destroy you with no effort, but no matter what happens, you will most likely have fun playing this even if you are losing.The community:Considering that I have only 100 hours on this, there's not much I can say about the community in detail. According to others, it's filled with strange, annoying people from different fandoms like MLP and Undertale. I haven't witnessed any yet (probably because I don't visit many community servers except the Skial ones), but I'm sure they're out there somewhere. However, from what I have seen, I can tell you that for the most part, the people here do tend to argue regularly like any other FPS community, but most people I have played with aren't the tempermental tryhards who get really emotional about winning. The general community is a balanced mix of polite players who help you, people who constantly use scripts to spam the chat, trolls, and a few hackers (keep in mind that compared to the silver ranks in CSGO, the hackers are very rare here, so don't worry about them too much). There's also a few mic spammers too. If there is one thing that does get a few people fired up (not everyone, but a few) on this game, it's the divide between F2P and P2P players. Basically, the F2P players are seen as stupid, ignorant, and disrespectul players who are terrible at the game by the P2Ps. Now, while I'm not sure about what the negative thoughts are about the P2P players, I would assume that they are stereotyped as materialistic morons who obsess over cosmetics (in other words, they spend lots of real money to buy fancy looking pixels that don't exist in the real world), but I could be wrong. So yeah, that's the community for you from what I have experienced.What I love about this game:-It's not like your typical run of the mill FPS shooter where the only type of character you play as is some random guy running around with a gun. You actually have to think here. You can use rocket launchers. You can use grenade launchers. The different classes make this game far more enjoyable than just playing a generic shooter. What I don't like:-From what I've seen, the in-game market is a scam. For example, I was bought three booster packs for three classes. These packs I bought contain all of the weapons and equipment for your class, and let me tell you something; it is a huge ripoff. First of all, the items that you use in these packs, specifically the primaries, are mostly useless compared to the stock primary. Second of all, these items you buy can be easily earned in-game for free. Third, once you have the exact same items obtained by playing the game for free, you will realise that your booster packs are wasting space. Unfortunately, you cannot use them in crafting. Very classy, Valve... With all that being said, I'd say this game is very fun and enjoyable, especially once you get the hang of playing a class. TF2 is definitely a blast.",1

17278,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWhile not having played the game as much as most others there is a reason for that. I refuse to play a game that continues to drop framerate down to 20-30 for no reason at all, more on that later on. This will therefor be a rather short review.The pros.- visuals are opinion based but when the game runs like it should it is a blast and looks good.- the combat is entertaining, in an mmo where you will do this most of the time this is important.- options in character creation are plentiful and it is a good system.- the dungeons I did were fun and well designed.The cons.- Optimization. The game drops fps for no reason. It does not use even attempt to use the cpu, gpu, disk, or memory before dropping the fps far to low. This if anything has to be their priority, they have to find ways to deal with this, but sadly nothing has changed since the early access launched. Adding new content should be done only when it runs well and not before,In the current state of the game I can not recommend it. If however they find a solution to the drop in fps that a lot of people seem to have then sure I would recommend people to give it a try. But due to the engine it runs on I find that unlikely to happen.",0

The company is working on getting things in order and making things more enjoyable.  Overall I enjoy that the game is being worked on consistently and being fixed.  It's a little different than some of the other BR's and is a nice change of pace.",1
5598,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access Review- The guns feel worse than their equivalents in Paladins. - The third-person view doesnt work well with this game, so I hope thhe developers add a first-person option. - The game doesn't look that good, even at max settings.- Movement feels bad, especially jumping.- The game allows for only 2 gun slots, which means that you can't have a gun for all low, mid, and high range combats.- The class system doesn't work all that well, and feels poorly designed.Would recommend staying away from the game until its full release.",0
8406,Brawlhalla,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst off I have to say this is the best freaking brawler for PC I have played, I honesly think I like it better then Smash. Net code seems pretty solid, I personaly have not experienced much in the form of lag. The controls are tight and I have not noticed balancing issue baring new ledgends when they bring them in, but that gets flushed out. The only downside to this is the games buisness model. I got into it with the All Ledgend pack. With that pack, the micro transactions are all cosmetic, but honestly I would be more than willing to drop the money for a full release cost on this and not have them in the game at all. The Skins are cool looking but frankly just not worth it at the current costs. I don't say this to rag on the game, I say this because I love the game and I think it would be so much better as a traditional game or at least a skins pack.",1

249,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"4k hours. Okay...This is a review coming from someone since CBT1. Some may just be my opinion or my own personal views so play at your own risk still. Read along if you are interested.At first, actions were actually done very quick, people asked for regional servers (like SA, SEA, EU) and they came in a few weeks after, I was satisfied so I bought a second CBT pack as thanks. I don't really mind spending money as long as it's worth.But things...went a little downhill slowly, it's killing the game. If you check the patch notes, most are actually gacha/TP shop updates. A bug we reported for like a month already was ignored, it wasn't game breaking but it frustrates you so much that an important buff of your class isn't even working correctly.Then there's another incorrect announcement made recently. Literally everything on the event page and mechanics said double exp event or +100% base exp gain. What happened on the actual event? The event requires you to pay a talt(in game item, not expensive, but...) and costs 1 talt more per buff, which becomes very expensive when used repeatedly. Now, that's not the only problem. It only gave 50%, not 100% or double, then a few hours later they said it was 50% as intended. ""As intended"" Good lord, everything on the page said double or 100%, now you say it's 50% as intended. Amazing.When you're having doubts exploits or something, it's actually fine. The game was hacked before and a public command was available for everyone to crash the channel. Great, right? This was already fixed but the fact that we have this happened makes it easy for everyone else to lose trust. Something you can never easily get back.Don't get me wrong, I love the game and I'm already stuck with it since Non-WOW clone MMORPGs are rare now. But if you are looking for a game that won't frustate you in the long run, I don't recommend it at all. Remember, this is from someone who loves the game very much.I had to do a facepalm myself every time I see a AFK/Bot/macro/scripted Necro-Sorc (Necromancer/Sorcerer - a class with summons) go on fields and gain silver with no effort. They're banning them, but very slowly to the point where their backups would be up the moment they get banned. It's stupid and is actually causing inflation, even famous guilds use them now because the risk of being banned is very low.Kinda sad really, this game was supposed to be a gem, but it ended up like this. Improved since CBT? Yes. Recommended? Nope, not until they realize what they are doing. They probably do, but chose to ignore it since they're milking money anyway, which a business does, and it's effective so they're staying with it. Don't expect any changes anytime soon.",0

6399,Minion Masters,2016.0,Early Access ReviewAwesome Game that is Clash Royale Style bot i myself prefer this game over clash royalePros- Good Graphics- Balanced Cards- Good Variety In Cards- Got Steam Traiding Cards- Nice Multiplayer- Not that much P2W - Steam AchivementsCons-MicrotransactionsScore 7.5/10,1
671,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Early Access Review[DISCLAIMER: I received this game for free by registering my email on the dev's homepage.]TLDR:A spin on the known Clash Royale formula, featuring FORCED-style design. Overall good game, at times frustrating due to RNG.Description:""Minion Masters - Forced to Duel"" is a Clash Royale-clone with toned down P2W, due to the removal of unit levels. Matches spawn about 3-4 minutes, though can be over drastically faster or slower, depending on the decks of both players.A deck contains a total of 10 cards, those can  be either minions, buildings or spells. Each card in a deck needs to be unique, though you have two ""wild cards"" - each allows you to use an additional copy of an included card. allows you for example to use 7 different cards and 3 times the same, 6 differents and two times two copies of a card. (You do NOT need to use the wild cards, however I would recommend it)The addition of a commander unit makes this even more diverse - at any given time you have access to at least three commanders, one of the being the one you start with and an additional two which are free to play for a limited time.Interesting is that you can unlock everything (aside of a premium account which increases your XP gain after each match, doubles received gold for one year among things) without spending cash, including alternate arena skins.PROS:+ No need to spend cash for any kind of content+ Constant balancing, preventing single cards from being overpowered+ ""Wild Card"" system gives an interesting spin to the deck building+ Comfortable match length of just 2 - 5 minutes at average+ Variety of cards+ Commander-system allows for additional customization+ Basic cards are not useless, some of them are even competetive staples+ Daily free token can give you some of the cash currency, without the chance being totally BS+ Daily missions allow for fast cash...CONS:- ... but aside of those and the achievments it is very grindy to buy new cards, which makes progressing a chore at times- If RNGsus doesn't like you, this game can be incredibly frustrating- In comparission to other CCGs the learning curve is very hard on you- Some strategies are less viable because there is no commander who really would support them, making them significantly weaker- You cannot chat freely, rather they gave you Hearthstone emotes (I hate that. CCGs are games which invite you to socialize, something you cannot really if all you got are emotes)YOU PROBABLY WILL ENJOY THIS GAME, WHEN:..... you look for a short time diversion... you don't really plan on playing it all day long to unlock everything ASAP - sometimes it is best not to play for a day or two so you have more missions to complete (you can save up up to 3 dailies at a time).... you should generally like CCG/gacha games.... you don't mind a certain level of competetiveness.",1

15162,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI have decided to rewrite my review completely to go over all of the current problems in more detail.I can see the game slowly fixing the balance issues and ""improving"" but it`s still not enough to make the game as good as it was before.First of all the new weapons :Proto seeker - nerfed garbageShotgun - no complaints, but it feels unnecessary and pointless because of all the powerful long range weapons. It can only be used in close range if you have an invisibility module.Mini shotgun - the same, but even more useless.LOML - aka where it all began, for those who don`t know its the original disbalanced weapon weapon update that everyone was outraged by. The weapon itself is idiotic because it takes no more than 3 simple steps to use this weapon : 1. aim 2. wait 3. left click.Aeroflak - probably the only weapon that isn`t bad, but it still ruins lifes of many flying bots.However the problem that ruined the game are not the weapons, but the EPIC LOOT update.Before you could play cassualy (about 2-3 hours a day) and collect enough to buy a loml in 2 days now it takes more than a week of grinding.Crates are supposed to be something that you CAN purchase not a main way of receiving cash.I don`t want my cash income to be randomized. Some say that it`s good because you can get premium items without having to pay for GC, but I haven`t seen a single person who prefers cosmetics over gameplay. Also why should I grind for something if it`s unrewarding, random and boring. The feeling of progress is gone and is replaced by grinding and crates.There are also major score problems, but maybe I don`t entirely understand how the new system works. Before it was simple - who dealt most damage gets first place. Now people who do almost nothing can get first place for no apparent reason.New interface is not that bad, but please add an edit bot button in the preview section.Inventory forge cost is incredibly bad. For example you built a 100k bot and you expect to get something for it, you see that you have 10 purchases, but where is the cash ? It`s simple everybody uses inventory forge cost and you end up receiving absolutely nothing. Just make so that if somebody inventory forges your bot you receive at least a 1/4 of the bots price, you receive only a half of a full purchase anyway.Also 500 cpu bot battles are just lomls a aeroflaks being pedofiles.I nearly forgot about new modules :Invisibility - I don`t even know what to say about this one, it`s only used by shotguns and flying bots.Shield - aka the least used item in the game, easy fix would be to make the shied move with bot.Booster - aka how to make 1200 cpu bots better than 1500 cpu bots that don't have a module.",0
2712,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Review (TAG ABOVE THIS IS A LIE) Geme used to b good between 2014 - 2015. Later updates basically F*@#&* it in so many ways... For one that wonders; Why dfq does this guy have 287h on record... Well I USED TO PLEY WHEN I HAD GIT GOD TIME BACK in the actual ""Early Access"". FYI They keept that tag only to lure in new players, so they can make more money on their update. Oh BTW!Have you heard of a game called NETHER...  YES NETHER I've already uninstalled it, I'd say Robocraft has become just like it.NO, WTF is NETHER.... Well let me tell you. It's a game where the developers didn't listen to the fanbase/community, when the game had great potential for future updates.  Guess what!1. DEVs got gready...2. Fans got mad.3. DEVs abandoned the game4. Fans abondoned the game5. Some fans stuck around and prayed they would recieve a blessing from God.6. DEVs came back, released a new patch with a new game mode.7. Remaining fans realized it wasn't a blessing, gave it a shot anyways.8. Regetted everything, when satan appeared on the screen and took your soul so he could fuel the game's canabalistic    hunger. Conclusion: DON*T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE (unless they revert to a earlier patch, lets say when they first introduced MegaBots). The only reason to why this game is rated Mostly positive is because it used to be good, really good, back in the days of actual Early Access.",0
4410,Paladins®,2018.0,"a game that was way better in BETA than it is now ... now its just a a broken game feeling much like a cash-cow... the laziness of the dev team is immense, except when it comes to adding more loot-box and buyable stuff. prepare to drop from diamond ranks down to plat/gold because the server just boots you in loading screen, or even worse , while you are spawning and selecting loadouts ..this will make you lose many, many rounds and getting disconnected actually turns your character into a bot, that will feed like crazy - in ranked, yep!  there is also a ""comeback mechanic"" that I - and nobody that i know - can really agree on. if you dominate the enemy team and play well as a team and take a 2-0 lead, the game launches its mechanic and puts the losing team in favor of capturing the payloadpoints faster.... this results in you having to wipe the enemy team twice while they only need to wipe half your team once.. because they will capture the point as fast as you need to respawn. thats NOT competitive, thats balancing scores.  also prepare to have skins taken away for no reason. i dont know how many skins i cant pick anymore because the devs changed everything or patched the skin out of the game ... its a mess.... the hitboxes are extremely, EXTREMELY terrible. i have seen replays of people getting hit when they are barely on screen (!!!) - people aiming under my feet but landing headshots ... the game does its best to let everyone have success i guess... leaves me to think i am not even good, its just the game rewarding me for aiming in the general direction of the enemy ...  hi-rez/mojo needs to fix all these problems to gain my thumbs up, until then , its thumbs down. some achievements are broken and still dont work after years, new ones added never worked to begin with ...  i dont think i ever complained about a broken game in my life but this takes the cake! casual queues are full of people who pick damage only, dont fool yourself thinking u can use casual modes for rank practice. the community is not as bad as other games, its either complete silence or a bit of toxicity.  the game is in a pretty bad spot meta-wise right now because you can get dumpstered in 0.2 seconds because all that matters in this game is burst dmg. thus, the same 4 champions are banned, over and over and over and over and over. and the tanks in this game are best abused as flankers or backline killers.. not even kidding. i spawncamped my way to diamond as barik some time ago, so it worked for me too. another thing about casual mode is, everything with blast damage in this game is just pure spammable .... take the new champion, dredge, and spam all game - over walls, around corners ... just afk spam and youll rack up kills no problem. map has a chokepoint? AFK spam it with drogoz/evie/willow while eating grapes. you cant lose. other rounds will  consist of people shooting you off your horse so u take years to get to middle... its just the same stuff over and over again. i had fun, but only up until i recognized all these flaws and just cant take it anymore.. not when i know how much better the game used to be, so thats it for now ... back into the depths of my steamlibrary",0

19210,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIt is eerily similar to Overwatch, so it's hard not to talk about OW when talking about Paladins.With that said, if OW didn't exist, Paladins would be, hands down, the best multiplayer shooter in the neighborhood. And it's free-to-play, so that's saying a lot!It's not as polished as OW, but most of the subtle differences in gameplay make it more suited to my tastes. It's slower, has WAY less one-hit-kill situations, the Ultimates are not as impactful in the team fights, and has way more hitscan weapons. The matches have way less crazy, over-the-top stuff going on than OW, but at the same time I rarely feel frustrated at cheap deaths or extremely lucky plays from my opponents. Items seem like they could be this super deep and interesting system, but they're really not. Once the match starts you pretty much know what are the optimal items to buy. They do affect the strategy in hero picks, though. And the hero-picking is PERFECT. I wish OW had hero-picking in Competitive like Paladins does!Speaking of Comp, the competitive scene in LatAm is pretty much non-existant, though, so unless you want to just hang around Casual mode and have fun, like I do, it is not worth the time investment.Finally, the game is very much alive. Every other week it seems there's a new update, and since I started playing around a month ago they already added 2 brand new heroes.Give this game a chance =)",1

Calling a game a copy of another game in the same Genre is a really close minded view and won't allow you to enjoy this game or any other game to the fullest.With that in mind Paladins is an excellent mix of objective and shooter, skilled players are rewarded for being good players which is why I enjoy this game more than OW.Been playing since the day 1 of the beta and I always end up coming back for more.",1
567,War Thunder,2015.0,"If you want a game that listents and is fair to the player base or gives competitive gameplay, don't bother with War Thunder! Every now and then they'll nerf progresion and implement stuff that you can buy for Golden Eagles and the player base doesn't want(you see that in the forums) , rather than to fix year old bugs.The Russian vehicles are far better than from any other nation and they are getting buffed constantly! This most experianced in the mode Realistic Battle where it's nation Vs. nation and the Russian nation has a win rate over 80% at ranks 2 and 3 over 90%! The RNG for Russian tanks ai just a joke becouse they'll pen other tanks at absurd angles and kill them with 1 shot becouse off OP ammo (some WW2 tanks have post war ammo)!You really dont have anything else to play than random battles if you're not in a clan and the MM is one of the worst i've ever seen! It doesn't even ballance the team by vehicle types... so you get into matches (planes) where 1/2 of your team are bombers and the enemy are only fighters... that's an auto loose!Grinding to top rank vehicles is also useless becouse there is nothing to do with them, they have no other purpose that any lower rank vehicle and you have to wait in the quene for a very long time becouse very few players play them.    Don't get me wrong the game was good at patch 1.35 (more than a year ago maybe 2) but after that it just got worse!

1903,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"It's a fairly decent game, very fun to play. And the nice thing about the PC verison is that you can get to see all of the details up close that you wouldn't be able to see on a smaller screen like the phone. HOWEVER!!! It's painfully obivious that this was originally an mobile game, due to the fact everything is on a timer. like you have to wait 14 to 4 mintues before you collect engery, food, and so on forth. the thing about casual browser and mobile phone games is that they're designed for people on the go. you send commands to your settlers/dwellers, etc and then shut the phone off while you do things such as work-related stuff... and then get back to it on your lunch break.  It's not really meant for long-term gaming where you can have fun building endlessly for hours. It's not that kind of game. Better stick to playing this on your phone instead of on steam.",1

13701,Magic Duels,2016.0,"I am a great lover of online card games, Magic, and the limited format.  I was hoping this game could scratch all of those itches at the same time.  This game tries so hard to be good, but how poorly made it is makes it genuinely hard to enjoy.Some issues I've had during gameplay:If finding an opponent is taking too long, there is no way to back out of the loading screen, you are stuck there until they find you one. If your opponent disconnects while the game is still being set up:You will have to play an AIYour rank will still be affected by the results of the matchYou will not be able to choose whether or not to take mulligans (in a ranked play no less)The software automatically changes phases for you, and there is no way to turn this off. If it thinks you have nothing else to cast/do, on to the next phase.  The system that determines when you're changing phases has no sense of nuanced play, and will sometimes just completely screw you.There isn't a functional system for manual mana tapping, and if you don't constantly second guess the auto tapping, it too will screw you.This game has combat animations.  That means that every single block and every single minion that goes face get their own animation. Every. Single. One.  This can be toggled off, but when you play an opponent whose animations aren't off (which are surprisingly common), you still have to just sit there and wait for them to watch them all, no matter what.  If you have won the game, you will still have to sit and wait for your opponent to watch every single animation before the game will endThe packs are only 6 card packs, which even makes acquiring playsets of commons or uncommonns a chore.The quests are sometimes very cumbersome, and will often require building a specialized deck specifically to fulfil it.This game would be so much fun if so much about it wasn't just absolutely atrocious. If you're going to play card games online, there are other free games out there that are not only more polished, but just genuinely better.",0
6281,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAlready put 13 hours into this game and I say for sure that I enjoy this a lot more than PUBG. It has an interesting and unique spin on the BR genre which is greatly appreciated in this market of PUBG clones. Optimization could use some work but it's early access so i'm sure the devs already plan to work on that (Game runs decently actually but it could run better).  I have a ton of fun with my friends in squads and duos; solo is fun as well. Really unique gameplay aspects that differentiate this from other BRs like the zone system, how you ""drop"" into the map, the 3 different loadouts you can start with; really shake things up. The inventory and equipment system is leagues ahead of PUBG, for example you've got auto equip for attachments, when swapping to guns it will swap the attachemnts too, when you drop a gun it will put the attachments in your inventory for you, can have 2 sights/scopes set to one gun and toggle between the 2 without ever needing to open your inventory.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who regrets their $30 spent on PUBG (me oof) or those of you who have been waiting for a cheaper or free alternative to that game. Some of the unique things about ROE:-you can choose exactly where on the map to spawn-you can choose from 3 preset loadouts (skiing pack, climbing pack, and gliding pack)skiing pack gives you the ability to deploy a snowboard and quickly travel through the snowy envionrment without needing a vehicle. climbing allows you to use the miles of ziplines around the map to travel fast and get to places that most others can't, you can also climb up certain rock faces to gain advantageous and strategic postions. The gliding pack allows you to use a hang glider whenever you're in the air, you can hang glide of a mountainrs, cliffs, buildings, or ledges to flank or surpise your opponents.-the zone system is super unique, it'll be confusing at first and seem like the zone mvoes WAAAAY too fast but once you understand how it works then you won't die to zone often or even at all. And part of that is due to all the different forms of transportation you're offered-FREAKING SKI LIFTS!!!!-extraction helicopter, allows up to 4 different teams to get the win-haven't encountered any bugs or gltichesROE: 8.5/10 (would be a 9 but i'm just gonna take off 0.5 for any issues/bugs i haven't yet encountered but might exist)",1
4774,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI honestly never type reviews or some sorts. but i had too tbh.When i first started playing this game i was just thinking its just a pubg look alike BR.And yes, there is alot of game mechanics which makes this game look like pubg. but we cant forget there is alot of stuff you can do that pubg dosent even have.You can litterly snowboard to go fast thru a field, down a mountain which you need to evacuate from asap. or glide your♥♥♥♥♥off to safety, or rush people with those ♥♥♥♥♥. you can even climb mountains, you can you a grappler to get from mountains and towns.You have varierty of wepeons which you gonna realize you like more the more you play. you play with wepeons that suits  your playstyle. Ive only played this game for 40 hours now and i have to tell that its really amazed me, i wasnt expecting to keep playing and just quit after a few games. but i have to say its really enjoyable. ive played pubg, but it kinda sucks you only can only drive 3 different cars, and run for the most of the time. on RoE we have 5+ different vehicles. we can transport easy without a car. its alot more fast paced. and its awesome to shoot people that are gliding in the air or snowboarding away for example.Watching people take the elevator thingys and shoot the whole thing down. Amazing experience. this game is fun to play alone, but 1000% more enjoyable to play with friends...ofc this games feels cluncky here and there. but its alpha after all.Game has big potential. worth a try.If you wanna look at my first video/montage ive made this game, it would be very helpful to drop a like and maybe a sub for  future videos :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCFGL2QA9W8 ",1
1219,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat little game.  Reminds me a LOT of Hearthstone, only it's better.  The animations and even strategy of where to place your units when starting battles add a whole extra dimension to the game.  Great variety of units and lot to learn to learn the nuances of which units counter which the best.It's a great fast paced game with a lot of strategy.  It feels a little pay to win, but then that's the way with pretty much all free 2 play games.  When you start ranking up you quickly run into players with much better cards.  However this is no different to almost every other F2P game and certainly no different to Hearthstone.  In short, well worth a visit.  Be warned it's addictive as hell and definitely will cause you to say, ""just one more round"".",1
8477,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is a game that I would have spend $10 dollars to buy. First of all, it's a completely new concept for a horror game that completely blew my mind. Also, the variety of monsters in this game is superb, and all of them equally terrifying.

It is very broken in alot of aspects but its early access which HOPEFULLY means its being worked on, right?. I get so used to hearing ""early access"" that it pisses me off. Early access IS for games that are being actively developed and for some players to get a tase of the action before the full game releases and at the same time the players help the devs by finding glitches, bugs, exploits etc. for the devs to correct.

17828,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewLast patch removed the tech tree and gave previously lower tech weapon tiers some benefits over their higher tier counterparts. This was good. Now new players have access to flight components.They also removed the 100% return on sold items, nerfed it to 20%, and switched from currency per match, based on how much you got done, to giving you random parts.  This was...horrible. Now new players can stare at those flight components and know that its hundreds of hours of playtime to get them. Also, where before they'd have been able to experiment with all unlocked tech freely (due to 100% refund on parts), now they lose 80% of their progress if they sell pieces. Meanwhile, those of us who already had decent block stockpiles are rocking highly cost efficient robots to smack down noobs with. That enemy missile launcher you're having trouble with? You can have that, just play a few thousand matches. That's not hyperbole. It costs 137.5k robits, which is 687.5k worth of sold parts. A match might give you a couple hundred robits worth of parts, if you are lucky. Thousands of matches, and when you've done it, you have that one part - not open access ot it and all lower tiers, just that one part. Want to try a sniper helicopter, or a gun sled, or a bomber? That's a whole new grind, or you can toss 80% of your effort out the window and sell your shiny missile launcher.The old grind is gone. The new grind is worse.",0

852,Creativerse,2017.0,"So, let me give my general impression. This is basically an upgraded mine craft with an in game store. This is nice in the sense that if you want to build some giant castle you can buy a cornerstone (which lays everything out for you so far as how to build it) and it comes with all the blocks needed plus a few extra. The graphics are good, considering that they are meant to be blocky.The crafting system is easy to figure out and a bit fun.The farming is a bit of a pain and required looking up several wiki articles.The armor is crap, it doesn't protect you from anything and breaks with in minutes of making it. (note to the devs, you guys need to fix that. ) You shouldn't have to spend several days playing to get to the tier five armor only to find that it's basically useless and breaks at the drop of a hat. You may as well just wonder around with out any armor, since you're going to die repeatedly anyway. Weapons, well, they last a lot longer than the armor, but even the top tiered weapons are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥poor considering all the hell you have to go through to make them, and did i mention dying a lot to get the resources? The big point of this is that the game has lots of blocks, most of which you have to pay for. If you want to run your own game you'll have to go pro, ie, pay the $20 so that you can alter your worlds settings, other wise you're stuck in an un alterable generic randomized world where yo u have no admin control over it even though it's your world. so, considering it's a free game (unless you want to tweak the settings or have all the blocks, both options cost money) it's not terrible. The teleoprting bit and such is nice. Exploring is lots of fun. But be prepared to do some wiki searching (since nothing on the games web site remotely helps you find anything or explains anything). 1-10graphics 5game play 9 (very easy to learn)mobs 2 (the deeper into the earth you go the harder the mobs are and equipment is unsatisfactorty)resources 3 (once more, you have to dig down and kill things to make things, unsatisfactory mobs and equipment)variety of block options 8 (this is if you buy some of the block packs for more options)replay ability and general fun 10 ",1
9402,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is pretty entertaining for the first 15 levels or so. You can complete all the PvE challenges and reach the Silver PvP rankings relatively quickly. However, once you reach the Silver level, you will go back and forth between Silver and Bronze for quite awhile. The reasons for this are systemic. The cards you recieve as a reward are random and the difference in power level, mana cost, and usefulness vary wildly between rarity levels (common, regular, rare, legendary, and supreme). For this reason, those who subscribe to the pay to win game style (at the cost of other players' fun) or those who have been playing the game enough to accumulate a quality card collection quickly begin to dominate the game, countered only by bad luck in their randomized draws during individual matches. This turns the game into yet another one of those skinner box games that eschews interesting gameplay as it's primary mechanism for engaging and retaining its player base.Tl;drThis is skinner box game that is fun for a day, so long as you bought it on sale, but beware of getting sucked into grinding just to be competitive.",0

25,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewLets face it, this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ It started as neat game with cool game mechanics and lots of potential with the currency sytems. But now it is a full on pay to win.   Lets start by discussing the currency system I mentioned previously. This currency system allows players to either farm currency or, pay for it. It had good potential for the unpatient players, but then, the unpaid currency rose dramaticly. The prices went from a couple hundred to a couple thousand for the unpaid currency. And no increase in player income, unless they purchase premium. However, the paid curency droped in prices. Costing hundreds and sometimes even just 25!   Before I get too negative on the game the mechanics are flawlessly done, paying attention to details such as wait balance and manuverability (can't spell). It takes the player into a whole new relm of thinking. They actualy have to pay attention to the physics of the game. Wow! Instead of just mindlessly slaping parts together you have to think about how it will perform in battle. For example, I can't just strap 100 cannons on my rig as it would be to large and heavy. I have to think do I really want a tank or a balanced vehicle. This mechanic aslo gives a bit more freedom to the player.   The graphics are what you would expect for a free to play game, decent, and can run on any machine. Although I can't really judge those as a have a patatoe for a PC.    All in all, this game had so much potential but coulden't execute it with it's cheesy pay to win and funding. It failed to complete it's goal.

649,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2018.0,"The gameplay is a blast. It's a well-thought out card game and it has some extremely thoughtful game mechanics and even design features. It's a lot of fun, the different game modes are great (I hope they make more, I can't get enough of them.) It's very difficult usually to make your alternate game modes as interesting as the campaign mode and I think they accomplished that feat beautifully.IMPORTANT NOTE: People say this game is pay-to-win. That is not at all the case. You have full access to the base game and can earn a lot of the expansions with gameplay, although you can make a perfectly badass deck without them. Now if you REALLY like the game, like me, you WILL spend money on it. Guaranteed. But I think it's totally worth it and the prices are reasonable, especially if you keep it to like one microtransaction a month or so.NEW INTERFACEI had never heard of this game prior to reading an article about how much people hate the new interface, so bear in mind that I have ONLY played with the new interface, but I have done so with the negative reviews in mind.PROS:1) It's clean, and it's beatiful. The animations really add something. They need a little work, and are a little glitchy right now, but I think that will all come out in the wash.2) It's lean. I didn't really see any garbage anywhere, and that's a bonus.3) The voices, which I understand it have been altered from the previous game version, are awesome. I love the way they recorded them, and they make some of the cards very intimidating and others downright hysterical.CONS:1) It LOOKS like a new interface, and I don't mean modern and hip, I mean like the game was just made yesterday and they haven't really figured out what to do with it yet.2) It's very sterile, and that is a big complaint in the reviews that I really agree with. Clean and sterile are two different things. Just because things are minimalistic doesn't mean you have to forgo style. That said, it is brand new, and I'm hoping they plan to refine it, sophisticate it a bit (because it stands out amidst the high quality of the rest of the game)",1

867,Magic Duels,2015.0,"As much as I want to give Magic Duels a positive review, as the game stands currently I cannot in good conscience do so.  There are just too many issues with the game, both technically and from a design standpoint as of this writing.  First would be the connectivity issues that have plagued the game since launch.  Many times I would be unable to connect to the servers for an entire day, although Wizards has made strides in makes the servers more stable as of late.  Why is this a problem when you can play offline (although obviously not against other people)?  Magic Origins awards you coins for purchase of booster packs to expand your collection upon successfully completing duels, either against a computer opponent or another player.  Therefore in offline mode you cannot make any progress towards improving your collection in any way, which is a tough thing to swallow.Another large issue is the very grindy nature of the game.  Veterans of the Duels of the Planeswalkers series will know it takes a significant time commitment to gain access to every card in the game, but Magic Duels takes this to an entirely new level.  Matches against either the computer at the hardest difficulty setting or another person give you 15 and 20 coins upon a win respectively, while you need 150 coins to ""purchase"" a single booster pack in game.  Furthermore, a booster pack in Magic Duels only gives you 6 cards, a far cry from the 15 in an actual Magic pack or the DotP 2015 packs.  To make matters even worse, there is a cap on the amount of coins you can earn in a single day from online/offline matches, somewhere in the range of 500 total coins.  This is obviously to facilitate the microtransactions of buying the in game coins and make Wizards and Stainless money, but this can make it feel like a significant chore to improve any deck you make without sinking a large amount of money into the game.  This situation will only get worse as Wizards is planning on releasing each new Magic set in Magic Duels to coincide with the real life release.There are other issues with the game (troubles with the online matchmaking system, the ""deck construction wizard"" offered to novices when creating new decks is laughably bad, etc.) but the online issues and the amount of effort needed to improve your collection without sinking a ton of money into the game outweigh those by a significant margin.  Although the gameplay itself is fine and the addition of planeswalkers a definate positive, as the game stands as of this writing it is not worth the time and money needed to spend on it to make a deck that doesn't feel underwhelming.  Only if Wizards addresses these issues either with more coins per win/lower booster pack ""cost""/more cards per booster pack would I check out Magic Duels .",0
7760,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"A Post-Apocalyptic ParadiseFaloout Shelter is one of my favorite free to play games of all time, I can play this game anywhere thanks to its multiple platforms , on the couch , in bed , while im eating , and anywhere else i can think of , it may not be like the other fallout Rpg or Shooter games where you get to roam the wasteland but instead you get to simulate overseeing your own vault of dwellersamd build the greatest vault the wasteland will ever see,and if you get bored after playing for 30 hours or unlocked everything in the vault with max number of dwellers and semi max special just destroy your vault and make another one , thats what i did after playing for a week and ive been playing for 110+ hours now",1

10016,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"Its a great card game, they put a suprisingly large amount of effort into polishing and balancing this. Suprising because I figured this was just an attempt to capitalize off of the growing CCG fanbase, while also expanding the Elder Scrolls universe. Bethesda has been diversifying the Elder Scrolls series as of late, in what seems like attempts to monopolize the series in the video game world. Elder Scrolls Online treaded into the MMO world, and now this treading into the more casual game world. Im not really sure how I feel about it yet, but one thing I do know, they cant seem to make a great Elder Scroll game that ISNT an open world RPG. Just like ESO, this game misses its mark, and falls short of being noteable in any way. That doesnt mean it isnt fun, and its definitely a way to kill half an hour or so. Sadly this game only makes me want to play Skyrim again, and quite simply, it does NOT scratch that itch. The game plays similar to Magic: The Gathering, but its card graphics are nowhere near as cool looking. The cards are generally lackluster and unimpressive, I was hoping they would utilize some visually appealing art style, but instead its just a generic western fantasy style. Magic has a more gothic and visceral style, where ES Legends has a hokey cartoon style. There are sound effects when cards are used, which is cool until about 3 minutes into the game, when the cards spout out the same lines repeatedly. A Daedric Cultist card will say a korny line like, ""for the queen of darkness,"" every time it attacks. Now imagine there are four Daedric Cultist cards on the table, and a dozen turns left in the game, you will hear ""for the queen of darkness"" literally 48 times, over and over, until you just mute the game altogether. That was my experience, and sadly I now play the game on mute, which should never have to be done. Overall the game is just ok, but since its free its almost impossible for me to NOT recommend the game. Because of this I imagine the steam rating will stay really high, you should note that its NOT indicative of the quality of the game, because in my opinion the game is really not great, its just ok. Not even the subject matter of ES can save this one, and to be honest this game has nothing on hearthstone or other more well established card games. Despite that there is literally no reason not to give it a try, considering its free. 7/10",1
2559,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,"In the beginning this game is great!In the first few levels it is a level playing field and skill will get you a long way.After the first few hours I nearly recommended the game..... but I decided to wait.Luckily I did.

8478,Champions Online,2016.0,"100ish hours on Steam is nothing compared to thousands I've played prior to moving here.Came in CO when On Alert started, got to 40 in no time and decided I'll just make money.Few years later there isn't an item that wasn't in my hands at one point. 0 cents invested and I have everything I wanted from rare drops to Z store stuff.Price of that was standing in one spot and not knowing what's outside MC but always having someone to talk to and trade with.But then the boxes attacked.Sales slowed down, no decent content was released in a while, I and a lot of players got bored and now I log in on weekends just to see what's new and satisfy my need to make virtual money.3/10, would carpet bomb PWE HQ if it was possible.But it still has the best costume editor there is and I guess it's fun when you level up your first character the proper way and there are still people that love RP.Or ERP, I'm not judging.And boxes ain't bad if you like buying costume sets and vehicles for globals or keys like I do.Addition of auras and new content every once in a while is decent too.Still, it's been a dying game for ages now that can be fun at times.

4199,Creativerse,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewSo where to begin, this game is good and has some good concepts and designs. The graphics are very visually pleasing and the game runs smooth, minus some rendering issues now and then. There is a good baseline of items that can be used, however apart from the blocks, all the items can be aquired fairly quickly. I have played this game for about 15 hours in total and pretty much have every item, minus all block colours and combinations. which really isnt long time get to end game items.As this game will be closely compared to minecraft, for obvious reasons. Although the content is lacking in creativerse in time they would be able to compete with them, such as a redstone equivalent.The biggest problem with this game is the fact that blocks can take forever to create, using forging rather than crafting. As this game has some very visually pleasuring content for structures, this should be addressed so people can come into the game and just 'CREATE', something like a creative-mode, would suit this game very well.Overall the way the game stands i would give this game a 6.5/10 and would recommend it to someone who would like a change from minecraft.",1
4192,Neverwinter,2014.0,"This game is awesome! It is a third-person RPG with hundreds of missions and an in-game speaker so you can talk to your friends and the people your playing with.

1494,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game shows many things I love, great graphics, great performance, and high social aspect. I run this game on a beat down laptop and it still runs PERFECTLY, never ever had a frame skip. I teamed up with players around me to beat a boss, and then said thanks and went on with my adventure. I'm not sure how much the cross-platforming is adding to the player base, but ive never been in an area with no one in it. But sadly, the cons. Crafting is expensive and takes a long time. The materials needed are sometimes terrifying to think about timewise. And don't get me started on quests. I started a ""Kill 20"" quest and then after that picked up another quest that said ""Collect 20"" and it was basically killing the SAME monster. The grind is VERY real in this game, and it is what brings it down to not enjoyable. I havent seen a party system for the general area yet, so I cant team with anyone and have their kills count towards mine unless I hit someones monster. In the end, this game manages to keep player-base by long tedious quests that are poorly thought out. The dialogue is very enjoyable though. 4/10 if this was the full game, 6/10 because it's early access and can still change (I hope). Maybe wait a little for this one, or play an hour to see what I mean.Edit: After this review i've continued to drop on, so it's addicting, just a pain in the neck",0

16414,Aura Kingdom,2016.0,"too repetitive and boring, you can take on any boss alone with some skills and because of that, there is no challenge. The world is too bland. It gets better when you're lvl 60-75 because that's when people're going for raids, but to get there you need to play through the bland and boring questline. Lastly, you're going to need money, lots of it to buy eidolons that will buff up your character, and there's some issues with the devs, like banned from billing, banned because of inactivity, and banned for no reason. Seeing the game right now, i can't recommend it to everyone. You could try to play the game, but you will get bored of it, fast. ",0
4639,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewVery simply a great digital CCG which plays very similarly to Magic. The fact that your account carries over to mobile is a HUGE plus as i usually play it to and from work. Its F2P friendly with rather generous features that help new players add to their collection. The option to combine factions brings a whole different dimension to deck building which keeps the game fresh and allows great flexibility in building interesting decks.Compared to the current king-of-the-hill ""Hearthstone"", Eternal loses out in terms of over polish and UI interactions on the game play board, but blows Hearthstone out of the water in terms of laddering, deck creation and most importantly cost.

1719,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is possibly one of the most disappointing games I have ever played. There are so many things that are wrong with this game. Weapons like the Springfield rifle that kill instantly but the starter guns take a whole clip to kill. As far as progression for guns and ranks goes you won't get very far until your hand over a considerable amount of cash. Most of the guns and vehicles are intentionally made expensive so you have to buy them with actual cash. There are a lot of players who complain and whine whenever they lose a game. They even have the nerve to verbally assault their teammates as if it is their team's fault that the fool keeps running into the same sniper or machine gunner that killed him the past 30 times. America might as well not have any tanks because they are all worthless. The Panther apparently does as much damage as a tank destroyer. Oh and don't forget about all of those anti-tank terrorists who ride up on motorcycles and blow themselves up on your tank. Be prepared for ultimate spawn camp grinding and good luck even getting out of your spawn. Grenades can apparently blow people into outer space. HE tank shells are an absolute waste of your time and money as they really don't do much you are better off just using your machine gun. And how about the Jeeps and motorcycles? They handle like they are on a Slip 'N Slide. All of the locations you fight in are basically the same maps with the slightest of variations in the objectives. You will no doubt find yourself bored to tears after you played the same map of the same town 5 consecutive times. The matchmaking takes an eternity to find a match to put you in even though there are available matches. If the enemy is short a player be prepared to deal with the totally spectacular team respawn queue because we all just love waiting. If you think the queue is bad try waiting to respawn after you accidentally crashed into a tree and blew up because of the horrible vehicle handling. On the generals side of everything the assault teams cost a lot of warfunds. Not only are they expensive but they also have to go through a queue which again we all just love waiting. However if you're lucky and you troops actually make it through the queue which is controlled by other players then you have to select a city to deploy them at. Once they are deployed you have to send them to a battle or initiate one yourself. Sounds amazing right? Except your armies are slower than a slug. But most of the time if you are a new general your squads will almost never see the light of day. I hope there are some major changes regarding these issues but until that day comes we are stuck with what could have had potential to be a great game.,0

Can't trade cash shop items between characters, or even silver?) and severe optimization issues/lag... it's not something I can recommend to others.That said, I sincerely hope that these issues are addressed in time, because right now I get the impression that the game is simply bleeding players at a fast rate (at least the amount of people you see in otherwise popular spots in the EU server has dramatically decreased).",0
10319,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewSo...I started playing this game about a week ago. Absolutely loved it. It's important to note that I usually hate Battle Royale Games. But not this game.This Game took (emphasis on past tense), all the things I hated about the Battle Royale Genre, and threw them out the window.It was colorfull, without being minecraft. It wasn't a camping simulator. And the RGN in this game was limited.You were encouraged, no, required to fight, if you wanted to have a good chance at winning. The best weapons and equipment didn't randomly drop somewhere, you had to craft them at a forge. Crafting them also required an ingame trophie you only got from killing another player. This, and the fact that you got a reward (shards, which are what you need to craft things at a forge in general) whenver you killed another player, made sure that people weren't just hiding somewhere but actually seeking fights. Because fights were encouraged, and they were worth taking the risk.People couldn't just drop somewhere far off, loot everything and then camp.That is, until a few days ago. Ignoring every bit of community feedback, the developers of this game decided to take everything that made this game stand out, and unique, and good, and threw it out the window.It's the same RNG infested, camping simulator that punishes seeking fights now, that every other battle royale game already is too.You can find dozens of similar games now, with the only difference between them and this game being, that they are less colorfull, and their developers probably don't ignore the feedback from their community (unlike this game)",0

Biggest fans joined the livestream nad everyone was outraged, against this Arena idea.Daybreak lost my respect few years ago for closing very cool games, milking them first - Everquest Next closed, H1Z1 idea closed and BR H1Z1 is dying, Daybreak closed. Later Daybreak lost my respect again, They were streaming and show that they don't even know what was in Planetside 1. At some point on the broadcast, the developers got stuck because they did not know what was in the first Planetside when already, talking about it. Chat on livestream exploded with hatred.Now instead of speeding up the big changes in Planetside 2 that bring in more players, they decided to work on something that has become an object of hate for thousands of fans. We were so hyped about getting a new continent, we were hyped to get a new NS fraction, we were hyped to get support for the new DX. A great chance to bring thousands of new players to the game. For what? It's better to ruin reputation with another battleroyal. DAMN DAYBREAK. Why are you so stupid? I know why, because you don't know know how to make games.  Adding a new continent, a new faction, and letting the game to work well on not-high-end computers in large battles is a great option, ruined by the tragic idea of â€‹â€‹Battleroyale. Unfortunately, as I have recommended Planetside 2 to everyone so far, I am not doing it anymore.",0
1831,H1Z1,2017.0,Early Access ReviewDefinitely enjoying this game. I usually hate single mode based games but the base objective and the amount of players per match won me over. So glad I looked through twitch's game library and watched some streamers.,1

1746,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewA ww2 fps game that in MY opinion looks like a game that was inspired by ww2battleground europe but instead of an actual ""Battlefield across Europe"" you get matches like battlefield 4 (snipers and tanks everywhere).The game is ok - not great.Why? Because the devs seem to be adding more ""stuff"" then actually fixing things like random crashings, ui not working right (freezing when leaving squads) and the game engine feels like meh.  Also....FOG! no...not tog....FOG !A meme comes to mind, Fog....Fog everywhere....The only time I've seen anything that remotely resembles this kind of ""Foggy battlegrounds"" would have to be from Scary movie 1, Shorty's car. (look it up).The guns does not sound like guns at all but instead sound like they TRIED to record the actuall sounds but something happened to the recording mic and it just didnt work, then they didnt bother to retry.TLDR: You want a ww2 mmo(ish) game where you kill people and drive tanks, planes? here you go, or go play ww2battleground europe.  You want realism? Join the army - Serb 2014.",0

14449,World of Warships,2018.0,"Quite a mixed bag, unfortuantely, with little to no mechanism for keeping player's engaged.The first ten-fifteen hours whilst you're learning the mechanics and unlocking the different ship classes are genuinely fun. It's visually engaging, the ships handle well, particularly the fast cruisers they start you off with and timing your shots requires real skill. Finding a game is easy and level up fast and unlock quite a few ship classes rapidly, giving you a firm handle of the mechanics pretty fast: Battleships are slow and heavy hitting, Destroyers are fast and fire torpedoes, Cruisers mix speed with heavy cannons and Carriers play like a simple RTS, with you directing planes to attack enemy ships from the map.However, that's all it ever is. When you get Carriers at around level 4 you have experienced all the gameplay mechanics you ever will, which is unforunately the point at which you are expected to seriously grind to unlock the remaining 6 levels of ships. Each ship class has at most one or two abilities, none of which makes for a really compelling mechanic in themselves, and these don't really change as you level up. There's none of the diverging options you get from a MOBA, nor are the base classes particularly engaging either. Sure, the higher levels become more powerful or handle differently, but every battleship will be slow and hit hard, regardless of level 10 or level 4. There are zero differences in their skills. Unless of course you buy the upgrades or earn them through lootboxes.I honestly don't have a problem with the Pay2Win elements. Do I think the upcoming Stalingrad battleship and its unashamed overpoweredness stinks? Sure. But they aren't egregious at the low levels, and only become a problem at higher levels, which you will need a lot of patience to reach. There are obligatory loot boxes, but the stuff they provide again felt incredibly pointless, particularly when if your ship sinks it loses most of the upgrades on it. Honestly, considering that the flags and camo patterns add colour to an overwhelmingly grey game, it is a bit of shame that they are lost when your ship sinks. It would be much more interesting if they were permenant, purely visual, upgrades. In a game where only a few ships survive most games, it does make these upgrades feel trivial.There are a few remaining gripes I have.  The game REQURIES teamwork to be fun, but the devs have failed to create the tools which would engage the audience sufficiently in this. Being able to see the paths of your allies would be great. Being able to see what upgrade they are packing would make teamwork much easier. There is so much MISSING from this game's mechanics, which is baffling, as the devs have spent a lot of time and effort on the many ship classes. The carrier gameplay is dull. Incredibly dull. If you lose your fighters because your team didnt coordinate AA fire on the enemy fighters, then you are completely hobbled for the rest of the game as your bombers are picked off by the enemy. If you manage to succeed at gaining air superiority then be prepared for pointing bombers at targets on the map view for the whole game. To give you an idea: take Supreme Commander. Lock yourself to the most zoomed out view. Give yourself only 3 units. See how long it takes you to get bored. You essentially have WoW's Carrier game. There are a decent array of maps and gametypes, but they all play the same. There are objectives, but realistically they all boil down to deathmatch as the lack of a respawn means that if you knock out a battleship you're in a better position then capping the objective. So everyone just steams for an objective or two, the destroyers get knocked out first, then the battleships and cruisers arrive and slug it out. Every. Time.TLDR:A great base mechanic which invovles predicting the pace of enemies and positioning your ship which is unfortunately let down by a complete lack of creativity or style when it comes to the other mechanics.

I went into this game expecting a wonderful world where I can fantasize about being a loli princess and found myself bombarded by terrible UIs that take up the entire screen upon starting even the tutorial. The only method of playing this game is to play the number keys like a keyboard and mash out everything because there is nothing but a short cooldown for every single skill. I am almost positive that I have several viruses on my computer after installing this game.,0

I can not recommend this game highly enough (if you\'re into the genre).This early access game is definitely on its way to being one of my favourites!

15004,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"Lets be honest. Other than I am a fallout fanboy, I have no reason as to why anyone should waste their time on this, I came into the game with such hope for fun, I was mistaken. Where to start? ... Hmmm well how about the fact that your ""dwellers"" will just let something stand there and kill them while they do nothing, the fact that your dwellers will only use the weapon you gave them maybe once every 30 seconds? Now Im sorry but if someone raided my vault I would be letting all the bullets fly, not one every 30 seconds.

The fact that your first four lunch boxes determine whether your vault is going to fail or not, You either get a special dweller, good weapon and caps or .... your ♥♥♥♥ed, as I have found out three times already, due to the fact that none of you normal dwellers can fight or explore successfully due to their♥♥♥♥♥♥special stats.

Grading downwards is easier for me by reviewing the bad points. (no point blowing up the good points).Maps (Navea):-1 for one central map and channel (?) where you can't switch channel for marketing (ie, littered with player stall). -1 for one central map where it links to all other maps. Each time you auto-route to another map, high chance to entering this central map.-1 for one central map where there's tons of NPCs that will cause fps/lag.Controls (ban hammers etc):-1 for un-banned bots. (from someone' video of counting bots)Character class:-1 for no balance between difference main class. (Sub class is alright to a certain extent).-1 for some class selected as sub-class, where the class' feature aren't variable/useful, unless it's a main class.Inventory space:-1 for time grind wall behind LP (loyalty point, it's OK) that you can gain from daily quests or login gifts. Each 5-bag slot are given through out the game but at a slow pace, these are non-trade-able, non-combinable. Making 10-bag slot requires 2x 5-bag slot item + 10-bag slot expanson, these need LP to buy. By the time you can worth it, your instinct allows you to inventory manage.-1 for fast fuilling items (ie, materials) that aren't useful. Unless you'r a crafter. -1 for warehouse only use bag slot bought from item mall. More LP farming.-1 for lack of crafting material tab (ie, a seperate inventory space that allows only crafting materials).Money gain rate:-1 for mandatory fishing, as these provide you a chance at equipment box fish which will sell at 100 to 150 silver to NPC (lv50).-1 for all item needed to progress costing alot. ie, un-boxing an eidolon equipment box needs 100 gold. NPC white weapon (lv48) cost 1 gold.Side-activity (?), fishing/gathering/archaeological/cook:-1 for un-stackable miracle box. Filling the inventory faster when fishing.-1 for 'hide and seek' glows for archaeological mining spots. It's either hit or miss. Weird concept of 3 choices to get the item, at little Arch.token.-1 for cook for being an item systhesis using receipt (item) obtain from somewhere. Combining the item (bought from certain cook NPC, at 400+silver each) + systhesis receipt to get final problem.Eidolon farm:-1 for Temple of Eidolon for limited to 1 entry per day/reset. And for Eidolong summoning stone needing to be inside to summon/use.-1 for eidolon key fragment being litiality RNG game/gamble. Mostly gives some crest.-1 for RNG game to get some items from Eidolon' connection with gaia (ie, hero' emblem).FPS/LAG:-1 for fps laggy game. -1 for weird connectivity, moving by pressing W during a lag can cause you to walk in mid-air. Some times, the player character can remain in mid-air(floating) due to some movement (those ninja' like) skills.-1 for minimum requirement met but still laggy. (Requirement by Aeria' website).Publisher:-1 for being a publisher, not a developer. So complains are totaly useless.-1 for publisher known to me, being disconnected from community as their CM aren't linked to the employee's of Aeria. -1 for publisher known to me, love to milk money from players without fix.Overall, good for hardcore players whom enjoys being an 'S'. Bad for casual players with little time on hand.What's stopping me from playing a private server is if aeria close AK down, they are most likely obligated to transfer saved character to new publisher.

14362,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"Team Fortress 2 is a very hard game for me to look at objectively, as my hours kind of attest to. In the 3000+ hours I've spent with this game running, I've come to know a handful of internationally based friends who I respect and value dearly, made $20,000 at the very least in the trading scene and made a name in (and run afoul) of multiple in-game communities. It's a game that's consistently evolved, from the gameplay centric days of old before hats worth more then a year in College were a common thing, to the particle and taunt based, mish-mash of an experiment that it is now. I was once a free-to-player. I played it for a good 9 months before deciding to finally try being a premium. That's how it got me. I first bought a unique 'Huntsman' from the in-game store. Then I found a Phlogistinator in a timed drop and going off what the in-game store was selling them for at the time, I tried selling it for $20 on TF2Outpost. Those were simpler times. From there I ended up investing $1000 (real world dollars) into virtual items, and ended up making a veritable goldmine out of the investment, in more ways then one. I could dedicate a long spiel to discussing how the trading community is a meta-game in itself, one where real tangible thousands of dollars can change hands in seconds in the form of a virtual hat or a golden pan, but I really just wanted to make this review to reflect my own experiences with the game. This is a very fun, very addictive game.It is held aloft after close to ten years since release by a very receptive community who care about the game and keep it going strong. At any given time, there's anywhere from 50,000-70,000 players online, so there's nothing to stop you jumping right into the thick of things with communities with depth and breadth beyond that of any other game I've played. You will be able to find a niche that fits, a casual or modified gamemode that appeals and you will have a hard time leaving. You'll make friends, you'll make enemies (especially if you try to get into trading seriously) and you won't forget the time you spend in this game.In light of recent divisive updates, there's a lot that can be respected by how the community bands together to tell Valve what they want and actually see a response. It's a testament to the strength of the community and their combined interest in seeing the game live for many years to come. For many people, such as myself, I'm sure they see a lot of experiences in this game have led them to friendships and communities in the real world, and I'll always be thankful for the time I've had in this game in allowing me to have experiences I would not have been able to otherwise.For the experience, and for knowing that it will continue to be a game that will stand the test of time, I give Team Fortress 2 a very warm recommendation. Just know when to put it down, remember, 3000 hours is close to 5 months playing 24/7.",1

Kept me more entertained than any Smash game.I only have one complaint though: Cancerous ranked community.Although I've met some damn fine players majority of the time me and the lads only run into sig spammers and/or brain damaged trash talkers. Don't even get me started on weapon starvers.Personally I believe Ranked needs to be redone or fixed. It caters to spammers with no battle expertise. Either that or they should make it harder to spam sig. I can't even play ranked anymore due to the toxic community surrounding the ranked game mode.Other than that the game is a solid 10/10.,1

14229,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2014.0,"Interesting, catching, funny and kind of comfortable game with great graphics and really nice community. If you want to spend some time living your Tolkien dreams, talking to awesome people, questing and deeding and crafting and roleplaying, this is just the game for you.Main towns and cities are well-arranged (no big chance to get lost, like I did many times trying to play Dungeons and Dragons), there's efficient navigation, quest tracking system and game guide, smooth and sensitive movement control (I don't get why it's so hard to turn in World of Warcraft or Age of Wulin, but perhaps it's my PC's fault), skill queue, automatic movement towards target (e.g. an ore deposit or a vendor) by right-clicking it and it's easy to get around an object in your path without turning (you just kind of slip around, hardly ever get stuck). Game has a honed race and class system, you can chose from basic to advanced difficulty classes and from 3 trait trees focusing on different skills and have real fun figuring out how to fight best. You can buy your own house, have fun with decorating it, store stuff in the chest (purchaseable space), exhibit your trophies. Crafting is easy and various, crafted items are usually far better than any you can buy (except the stock of the Auction House, where you can put something for sale yourself if you have free slots - VIPs get 30, Premium 5). There are many events where you can win great prizes, you can gain reputation with many societies and get privileges and awesome unique items, you can even chose to play the bad guys (Creeps) and create an orc or warg or spider and fight PvP against the Free Peoples (Freeps) at level 85. In the LOTRO Store you can buy whatever you like for real money, there's a great choice of buffs, additional slots (trait slots, inventory bags, chatacter slots,..), steeds, outfits, quests packs and more. It's not even necessary to use real money - you can earn Turbine points used in the Store by finishing deeds (it's slow, but hey - who gives you something for free these days?).When you're lost, you can always turn to the LOTRO-Wiki, there's usually everything you need to complete any quest or deed, even when you feel it's impossible to figure one out. And if not Wiki, you can get some answers from other players on the Advice chat channel. LOTRO's community is one of the kindest, most generous and most obliging in the gaming world.It's kind of comfortable to play this game, it's thrilling, sometimes scary, often funny and not always trivial. You don't have to quest and level, you can just relax and roleplay or craft or hunt materials, money and reputation. You can freely use the chat to meet great new people, join kinships and fellowships and have plenty of fun socializing. And beware - it's very addictive ;).",1
16970,Creativerse,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewIts looks like minecraft, but it has its own particular style. The game has its own way of playing and is honestly a little tougher. The enemies are creative, but I found that the fighting them was fairly annoying due to the fact no matter how accurate you are, you dont always hit them, and they will always hit you when your close. There is a ridiculous amount of things you can use to build, and even has its own system where it shows you how to build a particular building. The teleporters are extremely useful, there will be no losing your home with them. I really wish they would add a map so I could actually navigate a little better.Overall, its on par with minecraft, and is its own game with a ton of additions and differences that seperate it from minecraft. Of course, things are bound to change, so it could go anywhere from here.",1
14888,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI tried this game after getting frustrated with PUBG and I love it. It's early access and it runs better. I get less frames in this, but a smoother experience because it's stable. There's a decent season pass system coming that looks like it's not going to be a price gouging nightmare, a new map already in the works and just a faster paced, more satisfying game overall. Also it's free. There aren't any pay to win microtransactions either. It's free and it's better than PUBG right now.",1
15055,Digimon Masters Online,2017.0,"To all new players who's looking to get into this game!This game is a heavy grind, it's mainly about leveling your digimons and tamer to max level (99).There is a few dungeons, but the ones that really matters are unlocked at Tamer level 70 and are incredibly hard and require an absurd amount of gear stats and a Jogress level digimon.There is an easy version of them, still unlocked at Tamer 70, which you can do with a group of burst mode digimon.A lot of people say it's P2W (Pay to Win) but they don't understand what P2W really means.P2W is a term used in games who are competitive, where there is PVP or ranking, this game doesn't have any of these things, in this game you only grind to improve your tamer and digimon to kill stronger digimon.In the end, if you buy costumes who gives you stats (1000% XP)(which are event only, around 3 times a year at the most) it's just a pay to progress faster, you aint winning any real advantage over other players since there is no ranking or pvp.The game is build around the cash shop, i won't deny that, but you're never forced to buy any item since other players already buy and sell the items or Cash Shop currency for in-game money.If you want to put money into the game don't buy digimon eggs, they are randomized and the odds are, you'll get the lower tier. You can get almost all the digimon in the game (except around 10 digimons who are cash shop or event only) by farming mercernary eggs from the specific digimon you want. Don't buy evolutors too, they are simple to obtain (From Monster Card level 7) when your starter digimon is high level enough (level 90).The best item to buy are Burst Modes or Riding Items or Digidestined Tamer package.So in the end, play the game casually, don't aim for the end game you will mostlikely stop playing before reaching the requirements for doing the dungeons, take your time there is no rush, do the events since lots of them give cash shop stuff, explore the maps, be nostalgic if you are a digimon fan. If you're looking to make in-game money to buy cash shop item from other players, i recommand you farm ""Monster Card level 2"" and sell the ""beast low data"" these data sells incredibly well.Looking to see you in game if you have question about the game, you can add me on steam i will gladly answer them.",1
13236,Realm Grinder,2018.0,"This game is superb, possibly the best idle game that exists in 2018 - and they are constantly patching and updating it! With the tried-and-true method of resetting (Abdications) you rapidly bank progress to accumulate faster playthroughs, eventually Reincarnating. To spice things up, multiple different factions will offer differing bonuses or playstyles and become more or less efficient depending on your current run, overall progress, or even time of day.Then, when you think you've figured everything out, you suddenly unlock Excavations, Heritage factions, Challenges, the ability to mix-and-match your favorite skills and abilities with a special faction...and you think everything is clipping along at a nice pace, not much more for the game to offer, when suddenly you unlock Researches. This becomes an amazing array of choices that allow you to further customize and speed up replays.  And then you realize you've left the game open for 100s of hours, playing off-and-on casually for a couple months, and there is still more to discover - like suddenly coins becoming obsolete! Or entirely new factions invading the realm 40+ Reincarnations down the road!I am truly impressed and look forward to another 700+ hours of casually playing this.10/10 - Best Idle Game",1

DO NOT PLAYreiterate the game is flat out crus, the devs don't care about anything more than how much money they can wring out of chumps, the game has horrendous crashing issues, is devoid of anything remotely relating to story, is nearly impossible to grind in without spending money, even core mechanics like digivolving and jogresses are blatant cash grabs just skip, stop reading and go back to the rpg or mmo section and download the myriad of actually decent games there is nothing in this pile of wasted data worth anything not even for the most rabid of digimon fans",0

The artworks are great but the game is not smooth, to be honest i was hoping for a smoother graphics.The game is a grindfest BUT the joy of having all of the rare items in game is so GOOD.The Developers are great  it listens to its players and makes awesome contents for the game.Im sticking to this game while it develops at this stage, this game is still a cub and I can't wait for it when it evolves in to an AWESOME full grown lion.And one more thing ""THE GAME IS FUN.""",1

584,Dungeon Defenders II,2017.0,"I'm sad to say that I much rather the alpha version. It felt more stable and felt better. After coming back on full release, I was suprised to see ipwr numbers gone. I loved DD2 for just jumping in and out of maps and trying to get better gear. Sometimes with friends, sometimes solo. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to enjoy DD2 since the full launch. I had max level character (no ascension) and couldn't beat a level 40 map wave 1. I hopped it a lower level map (12 or so) and was surprised how easily mobs went through defenses as well as my difficulty to do damage. On top of the constant glitches and server issues it is more of a hassle than an enjoyment. I understand launch week is tough for a new game, but when you're alpha version is better than what is released it makes me not want to play. Maybe at a later date things will get fixed and the game will be enjoyable again, but until then I won't be playing DD2 anymore.",0

I convinced all of my friends to forget about the client issue as each and every single one of them faced a different problem.

966,Neverwinter,2014.0,"Hearing stories of Dungeons & Dragons seemed epic and I loved the concept. I've never played the card game with anyone, and when I stumbled upon this game, I was quiet amazed.I have experienced many MMO's, from WoW to a million of other titles - but I've never really engaged in them since all of them seemed similar to WoW. All of them were reflections of what WoW became and it seemed pointless playing other MMO's. This is a whole other story.The character creation stage of the game didn't amaze me, although reading backround stories about each race was quite nice. Choosing the back story of your now-ready adventure is also unique allowing you to rolepay and ""bond"" with your fighter as weird as that sounds. With these sort of games it's hard to see the things that ""make you stay"" from the very beginning, but the main reason behind all the hours that I put into the game is because of the combat system. You don't have a million spells compressed into hotkeys that make you smash your keyboard at any important battle. Here, you have a limited amount of tabs of spells available at one time. It's easy to handle, and easy to get a hold of. Having such limited access to a wild root of spells, prepares you to make serious choices - but also allows you to develop your own way of battle with a few classes, which is quiet special and makes the game more enjoyable. You might have a friend that is a Priest, like you, but he might be a ""engaging in battle"" priest (obvs not a tank) whereas you may be a support priest healing him. Having a group of friends that are all of a different class is obviously the best resolution, allowing you to see how all the classes engage in battle and how all the classes can work together to reach the same goal. The opportunities are endless and with no time limit on how long you have to spend playing, you can be deciding your own way of fighting technique - in your own very way for some time. That is the main reason I stayed and I'm not vouching for anybody else. The game is more enjoyable (not better by any means) when playing with your friends. Dwelling in deep, dangerous dungeons with a group of close companions sounds like a dream and if that's what you're looking for in a game, then Neverwinter should be your choice. There is a large number of dungeons from an early level with them getting more advanced as you advance. The monsters get tougher and more bigger with each new dungeons available. Each dungeon ends with a final, gigantic boss which you SHOULD find challenging. They range from demented souls to... dragons.But yeah, that's just a small ounce of the game. If you're trying to find out more about the game, the best advice I can give is to actually play the game because streams and recorded videos cannot capture the full essence of the game.By no means am I an expert in this game, but I hope that this helped the newcomers that are trying to get in the game.",1

They actually give you tons of free packs to get new players started, and there's a surprising amount of voice-acted singleplayer content.I don't recommend this because the UI is designed for mobile, not for PC. Makes it frickin' awful at times. This is most obvious and obnoxiously annoying with the way your cards in hand jump back and forth from the corner right to in front of your hero when you go to play them. AND THEY KEEP MOVING BACK AND FORTH WHEN YOU PLAY SPELLS, TARGETED EFFECTS, etc. That looks trashy as hell, definitely the worst part of the interface.If they fixed that hideous mess and maybe a better PC client, this game is a recommend hands-down, as long as you aren't squeamish of anime shenanigans (read: squeaky voices and pandering).",0

As of this moment i do believe im in the top 30k overall and you can begin to see the clear spenders as i like to call them. In order to beat them you have to spend money and its not cheap. Even the sales are not good imo. Be ready to spend 20+ bucks [on sale] to compete with the top tier players [pvp]. Alliance battles are great if you dont run out of battle cards. If you do run out the only ways of getting them is pvp or you guessed it spending money.

Now I know TF2 is out, but I wanted something a bit more like CoD, which I found with this game.To say it's a F2P game, it's amazingly good, nothing like I expected, connection seems to be stable for the most part, the modes are all very enjoyable (more so when we figured out we had to shoot the objective, not stand next to them like in CoD (CoD noob)) and the guns are fairly well balanced. I might only have 2 hours on record, but I can normally get a feel on whether or not I'll enjoy a game within 40 minutes. Glad to say I most certainly feel that way about this.Give it a go, you might as well since it's free, and honestly, it's a better FPS game than the recent full price ones.",1
19740,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,"This game used to be a fun free to play game with lots of potential. Ever since the vehicle update everything went downhill. Instead of being revolved around infantry gameplay with armor and air support, it's now based around tanks.",0
1398,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewDidn't exepected anything from bless online, but had been so dissapointed.The studio doesn't even seems to know where they are going. Third release and still no idea.Awfull coommunication, when you doesn't even try to explain what you are trying ""to test"", without a clear way to report bugs, to give some point of view, something is some kind of way pretty wrong.When you are told you are helping into a beta,  and feel like this thing was released because of a stop date...Even after hours of playing, didn't found any good point to save.Too many point this games feels 15years late.Many bugs into the game core, (can't use skills, loading texture allowing to fall through the floor). graphics using lot of ressources for pretty poor results.Seems they removed many things just to fake a path to level up (many places, as mountain are just 100% empty), the path finders trying to make you go through oppsite faction camps....being stuck ? use the emergency reset option to be teleported pretty far away.you need a emote ? ask other players  if they have been found or russian/japanese players took some notes.Assassin not available to play ? you can still drop their stuff.Need to test stats impact ? hide / remove dummies to let people make tests. (military districts).trying to be a pvp game ? do not give objectives as dueling an other class of your level when they have the reverse challenge? (there is a win a duel challenge but, feels weird) will people just agree to loose ? will people have to try to challenge unbalanced duels ? it feels so .... you don't know where you are leading the game ? make what you can to be sure people won't enjoy the experience.right now the game is a kill things to level up, and be an harrasment for any lower opponant you find, better if you can outnumber them. ( did it, when anger take the leads you do bad things, and you feels dirty, making other not enjoying a chance to do something make you get any kind of self satisfaction, my bad i didn't, sorry i guess i'm not enough a jerk.Maybe this part will be fixed when there will be many bus of high levels of each factions scouting roads. but if i like to imagine that things can self fix, i have a doubt.The pvp the ""purpose"" sold of this game is just .... a shame. never played a so static game who was trying to be : ""dynamic""not a good tab targeting, not a good pure action, just the worst of the 2 worlds, a pain to target and not reactive for action.You want to pvp ? why not using the battle zone ? everyone will be set lvl 45 but don't unlock the lvl 45 skills if you are not lvl 45, because it could balance things ?The UI is just a ... shame ? dishonor to everything that have been done in other games ? just being able to see if your team mate are around you have to choose to show up health above players and just ""try"" to heal the hard way.No stamina shown (sprint), dodge action making guardian/paladin even more static, you'll feel more like a aoe dodge denying class.Remainming stance switch class should be even smaller.Population on servers doesn't seems balanced at all, almost feeling like 1/10 or more (and people can't create your side, good luck to explain the difference between created characters / played characters)Been told that the founders pack are up for a single character ! Rolling on floor .... so people shouldn't even try multiples classes. be ready to pay for anything, and you still have too much cash there will be cosmetics.Some very important features are CASH SHOP ! Tactics are just more than confort .... but you have to pay for every characters ! need inventory expansion ? need any confort ? you'll pay for cosmetics later ! enjoy our way to makes you learn you credit card number .... (the feeling of the game right now)You used the dungeon team searching tool and got a group ? pay for dungeon teleportation ! 75 lumena ! every time, you can in game farm 50 lumena per day with an inside mecanics .... for an insane amount.So you pay the game, you can pay and month fee, and you still have to pay even more for anything .... Electronic Arts .... is that you ? As not even getting closer to all troubles, you exit a dungeon you'll be set to the channel 1 in front of the entrance, 2 choices, your faction is outnumbering the place, you have to use a pvp disable item, anyway, even if you use a crowd control immunity to try to run back in (2m) you'll be killed because it is just more fun this way.I like pvp but when you are pushed to hunt for anyting lower than you there is only shame in the player vs player spirit, the adrenaline rush, the ""i can do it"", no it is just a bus tour stomping tourists.You'll try to answer it is a beta ? not a beta, it doesn't worth some fixes. The main matter is that there is no objective to reach for the devs, like a frankenstein creature, patched with things saw elsewhere not giving the feeling they are mastered.As a part of the game have been removed, let's say for a better sight on tests, the lore is just the too many time seen thing,the level design is... still trying to understand what could had been the purpose, not a pve mapping, not a real pvp strategy with key places to control, except maybe dungeons.the race choice have some result on party buff available ( when teaming you can set buffs, the availables ones are a matter of races / classes in the group ), but to be direct, never felt that races were just so useless..... not even charimatics, some game doesn't have any ""race buff"" but you still feels like being part of something.... in this case .... it is just.. a single race any of the current available one would be enough.....The story doesn't care ? there is some not bad attempt, but... messia syndrom without any impact feeling.Sad to say but the main story arc is the closest thing to leveling pointing path. All making leveling a fast but .... so boring thing. And you don't even have to hope it will be building you mastering of your class ....The economy model is strange, so much control on the auction house, consumables are just very expensives to craft. So afraid of gold farmers that is just feels locked in padlock bunch without ideas of consequences. The auction house doesn't have any stat filter, good luck finding things that you could be trying to fit for your class.People doesn't want to rise a crafting skill ? at least they can collect ressources and sell them, but in the end consumable are pretty expensive (potions can be very usefulls, they are quite insane powerfull, but it costs 2 kidney to keep a good stock up if not alchemist, spirits are very very very powerfull upgrades but you may loose them on death, so you should stack plenty .... be ready to spend a lot of money.)The last and one that can change the most in next days might be the gameplay, started with a dynamic but 2 shots fights endgame, to a static annoying game not planned to be very pve proof. Here the matter is that is just insane strong, unexpected and might had need more explanations, (come on some dungeons were almost not possible to do, because people didn't knew how to take the path the devs wanted to try !). For that point i have a doubt about that dev team having a planned strategy.... Some huge matters have been solved, such has not having a true multiple attempt to connect, with a result of static screan, without any idea of what is happening. Some unbalanced skills have been fixed. But so much remain.Last words, i hope, that many things will be fixed some way, that bless online won't be remebered as a full failure (3rd release attempt !! and still no idea about what it should try to be ?).Not because i believe bless online could be a great game, but because it feels like people could be less enthusiastic in futur games. And i  want to believe that some other devs will have some respect for players. paying the game, paying a month fee kind, and you still have to pay for features....",0

The community is very helpful, and they have made the game less of a grind as it used to be very much so. They have made good improvments yet also ones that aren't.

1471,War Thunder,2014.0,"Hi again everyone; Happy Steam Sale! It's time for another review: War Thunder is another entry in the WW2 battlefest category, and it's a vehicular version of FPS gameplay featuring player-operable planes (and some tanks) that is sure to satisfy some fans of the genre. I haven't had the opportunity to sample everything the game has to offer, but I've sampled it enough to give a good basic review and endorsement based upon the fun hours I've spent in the game. So what are the particulars?Pick a major player from WW2, Axis or Allies, grab a plane, and fight. Or, alternatively, grab either a Russian or German armored ground unit, and go to work. At the present, it appears that ground and air games are completely separated, with the alternate form of fighting handled by AI in either game. You get some very basic gear to start off with at tier 1 and work your way up the ladder. Your achievements in game translate into research points for upgrades. As you go, your upgrades increase your ability to survive and achieve more. As you play, you easily earn enough (unless things change) to purchase better planes and gear without spending real cash. There's an arcade mode, a realistic mode, and a simulator mode.  I've spent nearly all of my time in arcade, and that's plenty of fun. I will leave the review of realistic and sim modes to someone with much more experience with those. Therefore, please assume my comments are mostly based upon my experiences with arcade.The Good: A lot! There's a lot to like about this game, even if it's a bit f2p-mmo-ey for some, what it does right is astoundingly good. I think it's beautiful. Play on three+monitor surround if you can. Add joystick and throttle+ if you like. Gamepads anyone? Or just ""wing"" it with a single monitor and mouse. The developers aimed to give you many options with this one, and it fulfills many of my gaming/sim desires involving planes, WW2, and lovely landscapes. There's an arcade mode, a realistic mode, and a simulator mode. I've played many games that attempted to straddle the line between simulator and arcade game, and as a result I've logged numerous hours attempting to keep my planes under control while trying to find and engage a distant speck in the sky. In War Thunder's arcade mode, you get some level of realism mixed with tons of action, action, action. Freedom of choice and strong competition make this game a winner with a large selection of aircraft, most of which you must earn or into which you may pay your way. A vibrant (at this time) player community on PC and PS4 make wait times for battle very low. The matchmaking is somewhat good because you get placed into a group based upon your skills and gear. The pay-2-win aspect is somewhat mitigated by this because while you can pay your way ahead you can only pay your way so far beyond your peers before you place yourself in a completely different rank of competition. Skill and brains are requried regardless of your gear, and this is a good thing because iron sharpens iron as they say. The Bad: I find there's a serious lack of balance in the game. Not everyone will agree, of course, but if you play the starting planes of all nations, you can feel the difference. Some will argue that this reflects the reality of varying levels of tech at the start of the war, but I disagree. The soviet aircraft and tanks always feel OP, both on the giving and on the receiving ends. I can't tell you how many aircraft I've been shot down in by players in soviet planes. I once flew a large bomber which had its tail severed with one blow from a soviet biplane. Rockets? Maybe. One shot? Lucky? Hmmm, I'm not sure. I've had wings cut off by soviet fighters like they were made of brittle paper. In this game, for maneuverability, it's hard to beat the soviet biplanes. For sheer @55kickery, it's hard to beat their fighters which appear to destroy anything that gets too close to their sights. In tank games, which only allow German and Russian vehicles at this time, the russian tanks feel somehow tougher to me. The tank gun sights turn colors depending on how likely your round is to pierce enemy armor at the point of aim: green for best chance of damage, yellow for middling, and red for lowest chance at damage. Comparing tank for tank, I've had trouble damaging opponents while using German tanks and a green crosshair, while at the same time destroying opponents in one shot using a Russian tank with a red crosshair. If you fly British or Japanese beginning fighters and the Russian beginning fighters on the same day, for the first time, after you're experienced with the mechanics of the game, just as I did before writing this review, you can FEEL the difference in the aircraft for each nation. The Russian aircraft felt better, were more maneuverable, and I scored more hits, kills, and assists with those than I did with any other nation's aircraft at that time, for that level, crews being completely new and all other elements somewhat equal. Gaijin is Russian. I suppose that says all that needs to be said. And I've had issues with Gaijin over their moderation in other games in the past. Take it for what it's worth. It's one informed opinion. You're entitled to your own, which I hope you will develop on your own by playing this game regardless. Some might claim that the Russian aircraft were just that good, but I offer you this quote from Wikipedia:  By 1938, the Soviet Union had the largest air force in the world, but Soviet aeronautical design was distinctly lagging behind Western technological advances. Instead of focusing on developing tactical aircraft, the Soviets engineers developed heavy bomber planes only good for long distance—in other words, planes that would be used for record-breaking flights like those of Chkalov's. The Soviet government's focus on showy stunts and phenomenal record-breaking missions drained resources needed for Soviet defense. When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June1941, it quickly became apparent that the Soviet Air Force was not prepared for war. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Air_Forces, June 20, 2014)The Ugly: I only have two complaints, and then I'll move on. First, don't make any statements in chat that anyone might find remotely disagreeable because the community has a good number of loudmouth jerk trolls. Even if you say nothing, chances are good that you'll read something hilariously asinine while playing if you play for a bit. A few idiots like to TK, and in that respect it's no different from any FPS.  Second, you're going to get botted. Just accept that fact quietly and move on. When it happens, try to open the scoreboard, click the name of the person who did it, and report them for botting. It's made inconvenient on purpose so fewer people will file complaints, especially false ones. In my experience, if you say anything about it in chat, you will catch flak from some jerk. Seriously, if someone gets lucky, that's not an issue for me. If someone is shooting at me for any length of time and they hit my pilot, that, in general is fine. But here's my experience of what is happening for your consideration: Scenario 1: I'm flying along, I hear br... (less than a second of gun sound) and my pilot is knocked unconscious. On replay, I watch a guy fly into position, shoot a couple of rounds, if that, and fly away immediately after. All of that adds up to bot in my mind. Scenario 2: I'm flying along in a bomber, same thing happens. One guy simply turned off my engines just that fast without any apparent damage otherwise. Most often, however, my pilot is just knocked out. My thing is this: if they shoot me through my plane, wouldn't the rounds have hit something on the way in, thus doing damage to the plane as well as knocking my pilot unconscious? A few scenarios present themselves saying that it could happen otherwise, but I find it happens all too often.",1

4751,Tactical Monsters Rumble Arena,2018.0,"This is a hard one to review, cause i really like the gameplay, and it really is quite tactical. But at the same time you fundamentally grind to win (or pay 2 win).It's not about cosmetics here, the purchaces you make are to avoid grinding. And you HAVE to grind to compete in this game, even just to progress in the PVE.The game starts out easy, and you quickly see the potential of the combat system. But as you progress you'll see the importance of leveling your cards (or paying to level them fast) as your skill becomes increasingly irrelevant, and the strength and abilities starts to decide your victories instead.The game claims in it's decription that you can play against friends ""Play with your friends in 1 on 1 virtual battles..."" but i have so far not seen any option to do so.Instead the only option you really have is to grind and grind until you have the highest level cards, so that you can finally compete in PVP and finish PVE with your skill as the deciding factor. (Unless none of your opponents have high level cards, in which case you're just winning cause they haven't grinded or paid 2 win yet.)The game also hosts ""lootboxes"", which can be fun, but is none the less gambling, and ultimately abuses addictive personalities. Not to mention how damaging a gambling addiction in general can be.Whilst i do enjoy the gameplay, the game itself is build on this foundation of grind till you die or pay 2 win.So i have to conclude that this game is ultimately bad for you, and not worth the small amount of enjoyment you'll get out of it.Edit 14/03/2017: 15:04 (GMT +1)I'm also fairly sure the game is riddled with fake reviews, cause almost every single top rated review is negative, yet the game is 90% Positive... wat?http://steamcommunity.com/app/705220/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_And they also seem to have a bot answering most of the reviews, just read how random each answer is, like an advertisement reply in every review.",0

17155,Bless Online,2018.0,"Ok, I've seen enough. Let me start from the beginning. I really wanted to like this game. I've been reading about it way before premiere. I was hoping for something trully fresh and mindblowing. Instead of that, we've got... this trash.I know I've spent only couple of hours playing, but if game don't want me to try its content then I uninstall it.PERFORMANCE ISSUES. It's one, big lagfest. It may be ok somewhere when no one else is, but then try to visit some locations with other players (not to mention bigger cities). Game runs terribly and it's not a fault of my pc. Other (even newest) mmos run smoothly.I've got stuck three times (inside wall, floor, stone) and each time I had to use recall stone, and run all the way over to the place were I got stuck. Once I fell over the map. I could watch freefall of my character as textures went up to the sky.QUEST & EXPING. There's almost no exp for killing monsters so it's better to leave them alone and just run from one quest to another. I could understand that if the quests were fun. Oh my god they are not... Run couple of minutes from one npc to some place, do something for 3 seconds and run again to the same/another npc. So if quests are mostly running and killing monsters make no sense, what else can I do? I've heard about dungeons but I don't have enough patientce to level up anymore.COMBAT. This is another issue for me. Maybe not for everyone, maybe it's just me. Unfortunately combat is one of the worst I've seen in a while. Boring, unintuitive and simply not fun. But whats the reason in making it fun if You don't even want to kill any mobs, right? POSITIVES. I really liked character creation. Plenty of races and classes. A lot of different options of body shapes, faces, hairstyles, colors etc. All that You need to create Your unique avatar.Graphic are also pretty decent. I stopped couple of times just to watch something but You can see that game engine has couple of years. It does not explain why my computer has so much trouble with fps. I will say it again. I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. I've waited before buying it and I'm glad that I din't spend any money on it. I finally tried it on free to play and after 3-3,5 hours it getting out of my disc. Seriously, try anything else. Maybe there're not a lot of new titles but this one is simply not worth it.Not to mention best mmos (like WoW, GW2, FFXIV, ESO etc.) or even this average (Neverwinter, Aion, Archeage etc.), it's even better for You to try something like ""Riders of Icarus"" or ""Revelation Online"" then something like Bless.PS. I totallt forgot about one annoying thing. Game chat. Oooo man, mostly russian alphabet, dumb people spaming some dumb things and from time to time something normall.

17067,Realm of the Mad God,2016.0,"So far, I'm loving this game. This is a rogue-like style game where if you die, you permanently lose your stuff until you regain them by replaying another character. Warning. This game is rage-worthy, and the more and more you get attached to your character, the higher chance that you can die. love this game btw lol",1
3541,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"There are few people who have never heard of the Ancient Scrolls (The Elder Scrolls), every game in this series is a great event in the game world and a new generation of fans. Arena and Daggerfol for those who are older, Morrowind and Oblivion for those younger, and finally Skyrim for the youngest. All these games can be called cult, each introduced something of its own into the world of Elder Scrolls, what we brought the game The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, let's try to figure it out.Firstly, I do not agree that this game falls out of the general series, trampling on the canons of Scrolls. Yes, the key difference between online games from previous single player games is that now the player is not exclusive, he is not elected, as was before, not Nerevarin and not Dovakin, but only one of thousands out of millions. This seems to hurt.Secondly, what do we have? All the same Nirn torn by the war and on the brink of death. Events unfold for a long time before the events of the previous parts of the series, probably this fact also embarrasses many.Well, in the third, the changed game model, which changed from game to game and would inevitably have changed in this case. I can not say that innovations have pleased me, but I have to put up with this.",1
2001,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2014.0,Entered the game without knowing fully what to expect from it. When I started it I realised this was the perfect game for a gun nut such as myself.

17786,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"There seem to be plenty of reviews from the perspective of people who are CCG veterans, but not many from the CCG novice. I will writing this review as someone for whom TES: Legends is their first CCG. I have also been playing the game for about 6 months via the Bethesda launcher, so the low hours recorded on Steam is not accurate.TESL provides an excellent new player experience for those unfamiliar with CCG mechanics. Not only did it gently, but firmly, move me towards understanding the concept of a creature-based card game as a whole, but it also smoothly integrated the game's unique mechanics into the learning process as well, such as the lane and prophecy systems. Not only that, but during the Story campaign (which serves as an extended tutorial) you are provided with five separate decks for free that allow you to experience different classes and archetypes of play. While it is relatively easy to move through most of the story using these reconstructed decks, the final encounter of the campaign is difficult enough that it forced me into the deck builder to try and craft a deck that was better than the starter decks. While veteran CCG players might scoff at the difficulty of the PvE campaign, for a new CCG player, there were some legitimate challenges that forced me to learn the mechanics and think about my choices. As I result, I felt much more prepared for when I began challenging actual humans not long after.As a F2P title, the monezation of the game needs to be addressed. Overall, I feel that TESL offers great value simply by playing the game, either by winning consistently on the ladder, or by competing in VS/Solo Arena. All told, it is quite viable to be a F2P player and have a lot of fun in the game, and there are plenty of people over on the subreddit who have hit Legend using nothing but F2P decks. I think it is necessary to mention that I am NOT a F2P player, but given the minimal monetary investment I have put into this game, I feel like I have been provided a solid foundation that allows me to avoid spending money later, rather than feeling like I need to continuously inject cash to stay competitive. For a game that I play casually, this is very important to me, and I imagine many others as well.Finally, I need to talk about the setting. As an Elder Scrolls fan, I love being able to recognize the references in the card collection, and feel that the abilities, artwork, and voice lines all complement the characters they are intended to potray. some of the card references are fairly obscure, too. while Odhaviing, Miraak, or Divayth Fyr may be immediately recognizable to many TES veterans, characters such as Ahnassi, Gortwog, and Allena Benoch I needed to look up.TL;DR TESL is a great game for people who are new to CCG's as well, and offers a fair F2P with a characters that will appeal to TES fans from pretty much any game. I highly recommend. Especially given it's free. Seriously, it's FREEEEE. There is literally no barrier to trying this besides maybe 30 min of download time and possibly a cap on your downloads per month. Try it.",1

750,Path of Exile,2017.0,"To start on a positive note, Path of Exile takes the Diablo formula and expands on it in every single way possible. It has an incredibly complex crafting, leveling and gear progression system, which is growing and becoming more intricate with every single update and hasn't been matched by any other game in the genre to this date. The music is excellent, the environments are alluring and the lore is fascinating, but what brings the game down is a staggering amount of well documented technical issues that plague it, ranging from poor optimization to server stability. The servers simply cannot handle prime time, especially after the release of the new expansion. And since this is a free to play game, making server stability a priority is clearly not in the cards for the developers. It's completely understandable from a business standpoint; however the game is no longer playable for me and many other people in its current state. Even if you were to overlook the incredibly poor optimization of its dated engine, the developers refuse to focus on stability issues, churning out new content and micro transactions, instead of fixing the game and making it accessible to a larger player base. The issue will become more prevalent in the future, as more and more players jump on the bandwagon with every new expansion.",0

Ah, restart required, hm. Getting a hint of No Mans Sky changes up in this. About 3 tries to get fullscreen to disable, and since you have to restart the game for it to take affect, thats three times I have to close and re-open. Upon my third opening of the game, I get a big fat ""COMMUNICATION ERROR"", the game better make up for this. I hit Okay, and the game crashes, time for another restart. After about three to four times trying to launch, server kicks me for suspicion of cheating, and every time I launched it after that, I got a communication error. My personal opinion, go play a different game, or drop a few dollars into a zombie survival game that's just better developed. Facts about the game? I can't really write a good review on it since the game itself wouldn't even let me play it, the one time I got in I was kicked for suspicion of cheating and every time after that I got ""COMMUNICATION ERROR"".

10606,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewTo be honest, I've spent some time on this game and had fun, but after playing Overwatch it really seems like a cheaper version of the original game (with original characters) and it's harder for me to play it since I have Overwatch. It seems to me and feels so like they've copied many character design ideas with some minor changes to avoid copyright questions and I believe (considering the available information) that Blizzard were the first one.Although Paladins has pretty interesting moba-like additions over Overwatch, I like the idea to have cards which with the right decisions can change fight and lead to victory, so this game besides the FPS aspects has also RPG elements or, lets say, ""tabletop game"" aspects, so I like such a mix. Overwatch does not have any such things (it's a pure First Person Shooter) and for me it's very funny to choose some passive skills (cards) during battle depending on how fight going and it reminds me League of Legends or Dota.This game is fun.Editing: I've played this game before the release on Steam, so the time played isn't the actual played time.",1

Sure, the graphics aren't great and the controls are a little off, but this game still has creeped me out to the point where I need a break every once in awhile. Maybe its the story being told or the atmosphere, either way, this game does a good job doing what a lot of PAID games fail to do. Actually SCARE the player.

4282,Path of Exile,2016.0,"Path of Exile is an interesting concept. An isometric dungeon crawler reminicent of games such as Titan Quest or Diablo. If you expected an actual, detailed review of the game you came to the wrong textbox. Reviewer's note:One should take into account that I only spent a few hours playing the game, hardly even bothering to take the time of day to make one single playthrough. Though do not let that discourage you from trying it out.Here is a quick summary for those, who like me, have no cash and want to try out a couple of F2P games. You constantly rerun the the same levels on increasingly higher difficulties, all the while aiming towards getting certain items and skill points for your insanely complex, copyed off some Youtuber's, build and amassing an insane amount of loot (downside: you have a finite amount of loot space which is shared with all your ingame characters, which can be increased through microtansactions). This leads to something called Loot-lock where one must technically transcend the F2P barrier. But by that point you should be pretty much well invested in the game.The game in my opinion is unique in the way that it offers a daunting amount of possible builds and character specifications, which i suppose allows for an interesting replay value for those of you who dig that sort of thing. The Highlight of this game is its stellar community. Nowhere have i met a more helpful, friendly and relaxed bunch of nerds who are ready to help you get started and enjoy your new found path of exile (from society).All in all this game is well developed and by far one of most unique and grindable F2Ps on Steam. Just not my type of game :) ",1

218,Brawlhalla,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI have played this game for 701 hours and 2 years now. I've tried this game competitively, I have reached the highest ranks (as far as my region goes). I've spent close to  $50 dollars on this game. Here is what I think of this game.Brawlhalla is one of those games that you will tremendously enjoy. It's got several different game modes, competitive, casual and private options for multiplayer. It's got a training room which has expansive options for learning how to play the game. This game has one of the best developers working behind it. They even have their own esports department, and tournaments are featured on the main menu frequently. Loads of options that you can have when playing this game free to play. You will have fun playing this game: if you're looking to play casually. Spend maybe 60 great, intense hours with your friends! Download this game if this applies to you. However to the 40% of the population who wants to try this game to reach the top, read on.Playing ranked is whole different game. Although it has a great esports scene, this game is severely broken and terrible at the high levels. The main problem is this: there is no punishment for running away. What makes a fighting game a fighting game is that two opponents are essentially forced to battle out in an arena, with intense action and adreneline everywhere. However, in Brawlhalla at the highest ranks, you're essentially trying to bait each other out and parry. Defensive play is the only option if you want to win the game. Let me put it this way: a good story has a beginning, conflict, rising action, climax and a resolution. In Brawlhalla, although there is conflict, it's often either you chasing someone, you losing to someone who waits for you to attack first, or you doing the above. There is no rising action. So when a match finally ends, is more like a flop. This game will feel terrible and there's nothing you can do about it. Some weapons are incredibly overpowered as well. The developers do not make a good attempt at trying to make all styles of plays and weapons viable. Like the disaster game which is League of Legends, there's always a pool of weapons and legends that are considered top tier, before they are pulled off. Where as some weapons make reading very hard (10+ different options to escape and punish back), some weapons feel like 50-50 or you lose the entire game.In essence, Brawlhalla is a fun an excellent game that should be played with many of your friends. It's almost guaranteed you will have a great time. However, this game lacks extremely at the higher level. Just look at a clip from a tournament that happened yesterday: a PRO PLAYER (has earned money from this game), actually TWEETED MIDGAME, because his opponent resolved to a style where he was just waiting for punishes. https://clips.twitch.tv/TenaciousBoringDogeDansGame . Trust me, this is how 60% of all matches turn out.TL;DR: It's an excellent game for playing casually. Don't invest time into it if you're going to play ranked.",1

12660,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWhile WotC's MTG turns your free cash into progressively lower quality outdated pieces of cardboard and bans people for having opinions, Dire Wolf is creating an engaging game that takes full advantage of the digital format that doesn't require you to sell your firstborn to participate.As much as I miss the physical format, I will never go back to MTG.",1
2306,Realm Grinder,2018.0,I just love this game. So many things to do and so many different paths you can take.I've been at it for about 130 days (on web browser and mobile phone) and there's still so much to do.This is a 5/5 game.,1
2202,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"It's... okay.It fits solidly in the catagory of being a waiting game with options to pay to get things done quicker. Nothing is impossible to get without paying for it though. And - if complaints made in the discussion threads are true - paying for things is risky since it's completely possible it'll just take your money and not give you what you paid for. But again there's no reason to pay for it. The game is pretty generous on giving you ample lunchboxes (chests of rare loot) and Nuka Colas (items used to speed up wait times) for free on quests and for accomplishing achievements.The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats are not what they are in other games. When it comes to combat the endurance (HP) and agility (attack rate) stats are the only factors. Combat is pretty much a ""watch the characters do all the work automatically"" thing while you give them a stimpack or radaway when needed. The closest thing you get to any tactical decisions is whether or not you'll use a charged-up critical attack now or save it for later in case it's needed. That's it.As a Fallout franchise fan myself I wanted to dabble with it a little. It pokes at my nostalgia. I see a lot of familier weapons and armors from the games. It feels like someone that didn't actually play much of Fallout made it. They may have peeked at the wiki, looked at some screenshots, talked to the devs, ect but they weren't likely actual fans of the series themselves. There were just too many ""thats not how it works"" moments. Which brings me to...Lore NitpicksVaults, in fallout Shelter, send out radio signals to add to their population. In any other Fallout game vaults are pretty xenophobic. Other vaults seem much more happy to see your dwellers visit than they ought to as well. To put this into the realistic light: In fallout 1 you are sent out of your vault to find a water chip. You save your vault eventually - as well as potentially other places depending how you play. But the overseer abandons you because you've been outside of the vault too long and are deemed an outsider for that alone. Your character is left outside to what the overseer can only assume will be your death. Fallout 3's Overseer was even worse.Deathclaws appear in packs similar to molerats or radroaches. In any other version of this series when you get a whiff of a single deathclaw you're on high alert. In this case however you brawl through 10 of them to get through a room. This game failed so hard on what makes a deathclaw a deathclaw.In some quests feral ghouls talk to the vault dwellers. Feral ghouls; the ones that have rotted out minds and are completely senseless zombies that just scream and growl and attack anything with flesh.The vault door - the big iconic cog-shaped door - responsible for holding off the explosion of a nuclear bomb and protect the residents from outside danger falls apart during raider attacks as though it's made of paper mache. Typically about 3 hits with a sword tears a hole right through it - I don't mean they knock the door down. I mean they rip right through it.ConclusionIt's oddly addictive. It's free even if it's an obvious cash grab. It's okay as a time killer or as a game that you might play on the side while doing something else - like reading or youtube. It's nothing great though. Even the guys that made this game probably don't like it enough to play or update it.",1
7827,Dreadnought,2018.0,"Seriously, try this game!If you like space games, light strategy, MMOBA or anything spaceship related, this game is worth your time. With a diverse roster of ships, seperated into three different manafactuerers and five different classes, this game oozes variety. 99 times out of 100, there will be a ship perfectly suited to you. The tier system is split up into 5 ship tiers, and three matchmaking groups within those tiers, giving you the perfect pace and style of play to suit your skill with the game, and the strength of your ship. Progression through these tiers, while a bit long, is very enjoyable, and won't leave you bored to death as you grind to the next tier. With the Free To Play pricetag, the only thing you're losing by trying this game is internet quota, because I assure you. Dreadnought is well worth your time.",1

1740,Aura Kingdom,2015.0,"It's a great game, but after playing sixteen hours total on this game for a straight week.. I've realized that I am bored.There is a variety of great classes (you get to choose one in the beginning and then a secondary once you level up) and lots and lots of skills, and the characters are cute. There isn't a lot of customization choices, but you get to choose an Eidolon when customizing your character. Those are companions that follow you around and can even fight with you.This game is extremely repetitive, especially if you start to ignore the storyline and simply hit 'Skip' to get to the objectives and rewards of each quest. Most of the quests are, ""go here and get this item"" or ""kill a certain number of this mob."" It is a game that you grind for levels and XP.The combat and skills aspect of the game is interesting. It isn't so easy that you can simply stand there and hit your '1' key repeatedly, as you can move as you charge your abilities and try to avoid attacks. There are many combat skills to obtain in the game, and each one has a different affect on you, your Eidolon, or your enemy. I found that as I continued playing I'd have a routine of what skills I'd go through when in combat.I realized that the game is much more exciting if you decided to find friends and play with a guild. There are many other side activities that are exciting, but most groups of friends tend to all go to the main server, Navea. Most people there are interested in obtaining rare items, which do not impact gameplay so largely that you'd be missing out if you decided not to explore that aspect of the game.Overall, it's a fun game to play with friends, but can quickly become boring if you stick to questing for long periods of time. I became bored of the quests quickly and had a hard time continuing to play, but ended up not knowing much about the game besides quests. I also didn't have friends that played & I only did quests during my time in the game, so I'd reccomend you try it out and see for yourself.",1

I don't see how you can level a character over and over again with desync in hardcore, with out offering some kind of power leveling. The cheaper the Micros, the more money you'd get.

16505,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2014.0," Before the Rider's of Rohan expansion, especially around the time of Mines of Moria expansion, this was easily the best MMO on the market. This was a fantastic game with great visuals, story, and the best community in any online game I've ever associated myself with, but it has been turned awry, presumably by the heads at Warner Bro's Interactive. The levelling experience from 1-75 should be as fun as ever, but thanks to horribly uneccesary class changes, among other things, the experience is desecrated. Thankfully, newcomers should still be able to get some enjoyment out of this marred product, though returning veterans will undoubtedly be dissapointed.

12567,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"I'll give this game a thumbs up because it sets out what it means to do - scratch that Fallout itch with a light-hearted take on this fallen universe.  The mechanics are simple and easy to learn within minutes, the dialogue is funny, and the art direction is colorful and fits Fallout lore, albeit repetitive on the quests.  It's great to pick up and play for just a few minutes.  The game does have its problems however.  I already mentioned the repetiveness of the quests and the combat is painstakingly SLOW at times.  There is almost variance to the enemies you'll defeat - get used to killing a lot of radroaches, mole rats, raiders and the occasional rad-scorpion.  I would be remiss not to mention that even though it is free to play, there really isn't a way to push through the game very quickly without spending some dough on nuka cola quantums and lunch boxes, which don't come cheap.  And getting all the legendary characters, weapons and clothing?  Forget it.Still, if you like Fallout then this is certainly worth dabbling and having some fun with it.

A ranked game gets you matches against almost the exact same one or two decks over and over (I'm looking at you, Rakano armory) because everyone knows they have the strongest combinations of cards and if you're not playing those like everyone else you mostly just lose with the occasional lucky win due to power and removal draw.If you're just looking for something to play casually and pass the time for 5-10 minutes, by all means, go for it.

They all are focused on different playstyles and you can switch between them every time you ""abdicate"" (Reset and gain a huge coin multiplier).

3426,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewBesides the fact that it can takes hours and hours of farming in order to get something (Or you could just spend real money to buy it... because its THAT kinda game!), I would have to say this game sucks. From the ""realistic"" gameplay, the completely ""balanced"" factions, or maybe the ""realtime"" wars that players influence, I would have to say that it doesn't really live up to anything that it says!Lets start with the free to play part! It, as stated above, can take upto weeks just to get enough money and XP to buy a weapon. However! If you think that you're above this, and don't want to wait, you can just spend the ~10 US dollars to buy it right there and then. (Buying it with credits even allows you to COMPLETELY skip over the XP requirements, along with the money!)Then comes the ""realistic"" and ""Simulation"" battles- IF one could call them that! I believe that the biggest contender here is the movement model, which although had some nice hopes... is for lack of better words, sh*t. Many a times I have been in open fields or with large arm movement areas, when I get into a firefight with another soldier. Mid shooting, my gun pulls up and does the action that it does when your muzzle isn't in position (Because APPARENTLY my gun was running into some invisible force?) for firing. Then theres the maps... Oh! how I hate ALL of the maps. From large open areas with almost no cover from base to base, to the maps where it looks as though you must camp in order to be successful, or maybe the maps with overgrown areas with large amounts of fog? All in all, the maps aren't that great either, simply compounding upon everything else that is wrong in this game.After that, there goes the ""balance"" which just as everything before is little but existent. I'd like to paint a little picture for you here... American Bombing Planes: 2 bombsGerman Bombing Planes: 1 bombSoviet Bombing Planes: 4 bombs! (Kinda crazy right?)But, the German plane must have SOME redeeming qualities right? Like better mobility, or stronger bullets? Nope, its the exact same as the other, if not worse. After the planes comes the tanks and weapons. (I'd like to just say real quick, Germany is EASILY the most underpowered, and it seems that the developers neither intend to make it better, or debuff the other factions as they just recently added the Soviets into the game, which look to have the best weapons.) From the poor guns of the German, to the crazy one shot rifles and ludacris fire rate and accuracy of the American weapons, to the overly good starting Soviet guns, its blatantly obvious that the developers favor some faction WELL over others. Tanks/vehicles, while pretty well balanced, are VERY overpriced, and some seem to have the sole function of spinning in circles or denying friction. All in all, the game's balance seems to be lacking, and its actually rather annoying to see the devs. favor some factions over others...Those ""real-time"" wars you were expecting? Or that ""huge scale"" battles that you thought you were going to get? Wrong again! While yes, there is a mega server that most of the battles take place on, and are ranked, most battles are only 16 V 16. This looks to be a rather small amount of people for all of the ""class variety"" that the game has, leading to searching for game up to 10 minutes (And thats without a squad... being in a squad can take AGES). Finally, after getting into a game, you may notice that THE WHOLE SERVER consist of just THAT class, or very few other... You can see that this leads to frustrating gameplay, and overly long searching time for a game that it may 'plop' you in, which ends roughly a minute after your joining! (Also, I'm not really going to approach the whole, campaign thing, as its seems to literally be pointless. Wars end within a day and most of the time it doesn't give props to the right faction... but you can almost always bet the Germans lose, even when they win?)All in all, this game really in a trainwreck, that yes, I have had SOME fun playing, needs A LOT (and I cant stress enough how much I mean that) of work. Also, before you say, ""Oh well you've spent almost 100 hours playing the game, it MUST be good!"" I would like to state that I have only spent that much time in game because I wanted to be able to expierence a large portion of it so that I may give a proper rating and suggestions!",0

18707,Aura Kingdom,2017.0,"Aura kingdom si MMORPG that focus on grinding level with acceptable story telling. It offer many features as MMORPG does like PVP, PVE, crafting, etc and like anime game . Not only that, it has a dozen hero class with different playstyle and you can pick 2 class as primary class and secondary class. I enjoyed playing with it for many hours(non-steam game) over a years ago. It has minimum system requirement, so you still can play it with your old computer (if you bought in the year of 2008 or above) . If you're MMORPG fan, I think Aura Kindom will suit you.But why im not reccomend it. As you know i had played it for long time with laggy and buggy game, Its seems the developer WILL NOT optimize its engine for several years later, so don't expect the new update or patch will resolve it. I complain that i lost my account, i had chat them via email but they ignore it, of course i lost my account. since then i expect them with no support at all. This is the most important to me, i live in South east asia and there's no Aura Kingdom server's in that region that makes unplayable.

8319,Aura Kingdom,2017.0,"This is a anime MMORPG.You are a anime teen that gets a eidalon to help you save the world, but be carefull for if you fall into darkness then your mind will slip and you will become a mindless monster.The characters looks too much alike since there is not a rich character design pool.There is a 3 character limit for a server, but it can be expected. There is a delete character limit per day.You can only be a human male or female and there are no beards or wrinkles. You only have 1 starting area.There is a auto-walk-to-quest thing in this game so you should not be able to get lost. Daily quests, mini quests, dungeons with solo exist and forced party dungeons that you will need others to complete.You can pick between 4 eidalons in the start of the game. Eidalons are mosters that will help you in fights and they have alot of speech bubbles that will ask you about new friends and stuff going on. You can feed your eidalon with experiance and things that can give your eidalon better stats. Eidalons can be bought and be found in the quests. The eidalons can be sent out on quests that lasts 10 min and that will give you a item, but it will cost them some energy. You can give the eidalons more enegy back by asking them questions and getting to know them.The people does not seem to be online or sosial so if you are not entering the game with friends then it is going to be a kind of lonly experience. The party and group finding isen't userfriendly for people that has not joined the game with friends. NPCs look alike, so you will see the same npc skin with different names.Your character can have 3 different classes when you get to a high level. The extra classes can give you some extra skills that can help you.This is my honest opinions of the classes untill level 15:Bard is a support hero that is boring as all hell. With a Green and Red music meter.Dualist is a single target dps class that is fancy to use and kind of fun.Ranger is a ranged dps class. As this class a player actually talked to me and someone added her to the guild for no reason.Ravager is a melee dps/tank class that has a Rage-Meter and that is fun in a fighting-for-you-life kind of way. I didn't noticed that I was level 14 at first cause it felt so much more fun then almost all of the other previous classes.Reaper is a ranged dps/summoner class that can summon 3 demons out of 5 at a time to help kill the enemys. Not that much fun and the rotation is too slow so that you are autoattacking alot of the time.Shonobi is a ranged dps class that can summon a shadow person that seems to be a neko or something. You can summon 2 different once by attacking, but only 1 of them comes out and leaves after a short while. You do look fancy using this class and you kill creatures effectivly but it was not my ally.Ronin is a melee dps class that has a soul-meter. You can charge up it to use storm mode to use storm abilitys but you need to fight to recharge the soul-meter. The attack from it was kind of cool and it fits to take down enemy groupes infront of you.Gunslinger is a ranged dps class with some traps. You have 4 spesial shots that seems to be randomized. It takes about 7 seconds to reload the spesial bullets. This is a class that is hard to fight single targets with cause some of the skills have alot of aggro.Brawler is a melee dps class. This is a fast, intens and fun fighter. It has a small heal and is intense to use.Grenadier is a ranged dps aoe class. This is a slow, aoe, damage dealer that can summon a machinegun to help, even has a frost grenade.Wizard is a ranged dps class. This is a complicated one to use since it has a spell sync that you need to get some damage out of the spells with a spamable one, a healing one and a upgrader to 1 of your 4 elements.Guardian is a melee tank class. You have a shield that can take the hits and later a skill that can reflect and protect you. Shield bash for the stun.Holy Sword is a melee dmg/aoe/semi-tank class. You have a claymore and the light to kill enemys in an aoe. You have a Divine-Energy-Meter that automaticly fill that will make your skills do more damage for 1 attack, then recharge. Has skills that close gaps.Sorcerer is a ranged dps support class. You have a book and deal damage with spells, even some support skills. You have a Dark-Magic-Meter that is filled by some of your spells and it can have up to 3 spells. The spells can be casted with a higher effect and it seems random what you got.This character lasted until level 32 before I could not stand it anymore.The grenader is a ranged dps that was kind of op. I just mean it cause I defeated people 11 levels over me by using the stun shot and the frost grenade + have the turret up right before the dual starts.This is not the best or worst MMORPG out there. It is kind of mediocer in my opinion. So if you like having alot of classes to pick from and being only humans with eidalons that can help you fight and you have friends playing with you then this might be a game for you.Have fun, enjoy and cuddle your eidalon :)",0

19970,Bless Online,2018.0,Early Access Reviewi Truly am saddened by this games launch to pay 40 dollars for a founders pack that was made useless by the devs decisions is silly let me tell you my story so far. so bless launches yesterday the 28th I bought the game at around 3:00 EST I buy and download the game because there has been a lot of hype and although I know launches can be rocky i was not ready for what was going to unfold i download the game and its a pretty quick download an hour or so and launch it for the first time it opens a launcher and i can't play the servers are down for maintenance and im just stuck so after waiting for about 30 min i was told to restart steam because they pushed an update so i did. the update downloaded and i launched the game and pressed play it launched in an odd resolution and was very small so i closed it and tried to change it in the launcher settings only to find there is no 1920x1080p resolution so i put it on the highest it could go (720p) and relaunched only to get stuck on the bless splash screen for a while i relaunched the game over 7 times until it finally decided to let me in. i got in and was prompted to make a character and that was probably the nicest part about my experience was there were a lot of options for character creation reminds me of black desert character creation bit i digress.I created my Character and hopped into the game for the first time i was in the tutorial and got around 15fps the first npc i talked to had a very poor english translation it was wonky at best that's when i got to the combat system (i chose to be a paladin) my main attack was not left click it was 1 R R R this is not an action type combat system it was not fast pace it was slow and clunky then before i had a chance to mess with the skill tree i was disconnected from the server because it crashed as i reloaded my game and got past the Buggy splash screen i was greeted with a full server with a queue of over 4000 players it took me hours to get in th top 600 and as i was approaching 100 i got booted to 500 again and again till the server went down again. Thats when i stopped playing and decided to wait till this morning the 29th and  getting in was better but as i got in the fps was so bad i had to wait 5 ish min for things to render on my screen keep in mind im on a 50mb connection and i have a gtx 1060 6gb so not a potato by far then once it rendered i was averaging about 20-24 fps i did the first quest of dropping the dead body and went afk for 5 min and came back to a disconnected screen server crash again i didnt claim my rewards as a founder after i had found out if you for example claim them on a character on server 1 and dont want to be that character you lose all founder items on your new character and if god forbid you delete that character you lost all founder stuff forever,0

18464,Fishing Planet,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewPreface: This review is a ""compare & contrast"" with another popular fishing title released around the same time, Dovetail Games' Euro Fishing. I like both and think they're both quality titles, but they do different things well and will satisfy different tastes. This review is meant to help you decide which one you might prefer. I wrote a similar review for Euro Fishing, and will update both when Fishing Planet comes out of early access.+Free, with a generous FTP model Fishing Planet's FTP model is described on the wiki as ""free to win"", and while that sounds contrived it really is pretty accurate. Fishing Planet is very generous with what is available to non-paying players, and the devs have stated that they want people to pay to support the game, not because they were forced to in order to progress. Be forewarned that the mid-game can get grindy, but overall I think that Fishing Planet is living up to its FTP intentions.+Nice variety of fishing styles & techniques Even in early access, Fishing Planet has a great variety of angling styles, and it even recognizes different lure presentation techniques within spin fishing. The devs have promised even more styles in the future (including boat and kayak fishing), but Fishing Planet is already a fairly comprehensive US fishing game, with potential to be even greater.+Lots of different places to fish Fishing Planet has locations all over the US, and will include different water types in each (rivers, lakes, marshes, reservoirs etc). The devs have said that an eventual goal is to have locations outside the USA as well. +Great variety of fish Panfish. Crappie. Catfish. Bass. Pike. Trout. Salmon. Gar. Lots of different kinds of fish, and more might be on the way. Such a diverse group of target fish requires lots of different angling methods, giving Fishing Planet a ton of longevity. This variety of angling methods, locations and fish is Fishing Planet's greatest strength against the rather one-dimensional Euro Fishing.+Excellent water effects The water in Fishing Planet is beautiful, which means a lot when you'll spend most of your time in-game staring at it. Personally I love how well it reflects the surrounding environment, and reacts to your line. This is another area where one of FP's strengths aligns against a particular weakness of DTG's Euro Fishing, which struggles a bit with its water.+Tons of gear Geeking out over gear is part of the fun of the hobby, and Fishing Planet really delivers with a large store of real-world fishing toys. One nice nod to immersion is that while you're out fishing, the local shops will have different gear on hand. -Limited spots to fish from in each area Although you can fish all over the US in different kinds of water, each area only gives you a few cramped spots to fish from. There is little room for the exploration found in DTG's Euro Fishing, and each location does feel more like a videogame set piece than a real place. It doesn't take long for each area to feel a little stale.-Weak casting mechanics Click LMB to fill the power bar. Easy, but honestly it's a letdown in comparison to the casting in DTG's Euro Fishing. This is where Fishing Planet falls short against a strength of its European counterpart.-Audio is incomplete, and impedes immersion Fishing Planet is in early access, so hopefully the audio will see some TLC before release. However, at this point it's noticeably incomplete, and hampers the immersive aspects of FP's strong points.-No landing mechanic Currently you just reel the fish in, and there is no mechanic for netting or handling them. One could argue this is better than the pretty rough netting mechanic of Euro Fishing, but hopefully something is added at release. -No photo-op Fishing Planet's presentation of your catch is disappointing. Your character just hangs them in front of your screen by your line, and they flop around until you click through the stats box. DTG's photo-op finish to each catch does a great job of showing off the fish, and helps give them a sense of personality. FP's fish (even the unique ones) end up feeling a bit cookie-cutter and bland. -Multiplayer is a chatroom As a game that bills itself as an MMO, I really expected more than this. The devs have more multiplayer features on the way, but at the moment Fishing Planet is basically a single-player game with a chatroom. DTG's Euro Fishing actually lets you fish with other players in the same location.-Weak NPE (new player experience) Fishing Planet's tutorials are cursory at best, nothing more than a few click-through menus. Hopefully a more comprehensive tutorial is added at launch. However, the wiki is, despite being a work-in-progress, quite good.",1

5211,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,,"player from Direwolf days (beta and early or so.) If you are smart and browse Steam reviews only reading the negative ones to get actual non-sponsored opinions, this re-visit impression is for you.Stay away from this game, it looks like Bethesda is no longer making any money with this one and dont have the decency to can it, rather opting to syphon the existing fan base of as much as possible and kill it slowly. Hence the decision to pass it off to Shitpants or whatever this company is called, 99% chance you never heard of and YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHY. You can tell from the name alone what their priorities are.At the moment it looks like they are full-stop converting the game to exclusively P2W/P2P, if that, possibly P2L at this point like is trending right now among mobile-type casual games and are making ♥♥♥♥ed up choices to the already questionable balance, possibly only releasing cards that have been pre-made for them, impossible to imagine this new company will produce any new content themselves (I mean just look at their ♥♥♥♥ed up website and repertoire of ""mobile masterpieces,"" looks like a malware distributor that you end up at if you click on a wrong link accidentally.)ES:L was kind of charming at it's inception, it wasn't very balanced and fairly P2W but kind of generous compared to HS for example. There was some illusion and even possibility to play it daily even F2P and get somewhere, perhaps a little money here and there. The fanbase for these games sucks and this was understood, so they had to make a lot more aggro style cards for them and add more RNG elements to give them a chance (and to copy HS, which is all this game was at the end of the day, a genuine attempt at a decent HS clone/competitor) but it was tolerable. Some of the YT and content creators were cool and enthusiastic, rather than just phoning it in for Amazon giftcards or whatever.  Despite it's flaws it had an endearing Bethesda quality to it of circa 2010~/Skyrim era and a couple of cool ideas/designs and it was possible to have fun and interesting matches now and again. While some of that may still be there for the time, it's clear that the corporates have decided that it's past it's prime and you won't find any redeeming qualities left here before too long. It may see another expansion if one has already been made ahead of time, but even that seems like a stretch at this point considering how long it's been since the last one.",0

12027,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2017.0,"Fun game at first, and its build and class systems are really nice.

11438,PlanetSide 2,2012.0,"Sony did something right for once. Made a game for Free. This isn't a Pay-to-Win game like other such titles in Steam. This one you can still get a subscription and you get extra credits/Station Cash per month; whereas Free members have to work a littler hard to get such credits. Also, free members have to pay for their Station Cash (SC). 500 points = 5.00, 1,000 SC = 10.00 and so forth.If you like MMO+FPS, then this is the game for you. Planetside (first one) was amazing and they just made it better. Having 40+ tanks roll down the biggest highway at one time is pretty damn epic. It has the team support like the battlefield series: VoIP (that actually works), strategic objectives, multiple classes to choose from; intense fighting, one shot kills. If you think you can spray and pray in this game... you're wrong! There is NO (NO) loading screens. You interact with all the players at once. Having over 1,000 players at a base trying to defend/attack is epic. Give it a try and see what you think.",1

8030,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"I've put many months into this game both here on Steam and on the browser variant back before they had a steam option, and I won't lie. This game was (key word there *was* ) pretty decent. I enjoyed the strengths each faction posessed, how each fight was based upon the steadfast response of the generals and how quickly the soldiers (players) could react to a confrontation especially in a 3-front war zone. battles would last many hours, and you'd make a ton of money in the war mode. Tanks were difficult to deal with due to the very few ways you could actually take care of it, planes could change the outcome of a war with a well-placed/timed bomb, snipers consistently moved after kills and kept enemy troops on high alert. And the two-front spawn protection (spawning on the point or if it was being taken you spawn around the outer edges, all of which with an invisibility protection until your first shot/20 feet movement.) helped keep the battles continuous and fairly balanced even in a tough situation when outnumbered or people attempting to spawn trap instead of capping the point...But then came the plague that is Reto as they do with every patch ""in the name of fun. Originally all three factions were to get their own Anti Tank Rifles, this was a highlight for me! I love the idea of having a fair shot as a soldier to fight armor if you're smart about where you put your shots... Well.. that was 2 years ago or just about at this point. The only faction of those 3 to get an AT rifle is the russians with PTRD's. Things then began to steadily become more... aggrivatingly skewed, from ""fixing"" LMG's to have severe conical spread almost right out of the barrel, to their recent changes that force players to purchase generals instead of career changing to them [unless that's just a bug but i'm not entirely sure of that]... The Long Version The War [Generals] tab gives the losing factions an ""underdog"" bonsus... or well, it's supposed to. In the past few months the ""bonus"" has become forever hooked to the U.S.S.R. [this most recent being a 67% bonus to their faction even when they were in first place for the last several days.]Sure, perhaps it's just a glitch in the scripting i'll accept that. It's just a buffer afterall, don't get much out of war except better income for your efforts... But then come the more notable skews.The most notorious being the Yak-9's. Unload multiple clips of an AA gun or P38 / BF 109 into it, it remains alive. Yet get shot by it as a P-38 or BF-109, and you're chopped down in seconds, and its bombs reach several meters further than either of the other two planes (by almost 30 feet).The second being the simple fact that the Russian playerbase are rather arrogant and extensively hate-based against anyone who doesn't use the Russian faction, and will enter others' factions just to hate on them. This ends up causing a domino effect which gets the butt-hurt individuals in the other factions to start going around doing the same, which ends up being a giant rage-fest instead of gaming.Third one being the skew in AT methods... While this has recently been ""fixed"" (i use the term loosely) by giving the U.S sticky-grenades and (much later) the Lawn-dart grenades for the Germans, the U.S.S.R have RPG grenades, once again having had them far longer than any other faction and giving them extensive bonuses due to the fact that they can break through near triple the amount of armor compared to the others. (3 stickies to kill a light tank, 2 RPG-43's to kill a medium... 4 lawn darts to kill a light. Lawn darts being far more expensive than the other two.)Paratroopers primarily based on the U.S get a carbine, which wouldn't be extensively agitating if it wasn't for the fact it can get so ridiculously powerful and accurate at range that it puts the K98, Mosin and M1903 to shame. [and FYI, Reto... Bowl shaped parachutes WERE NOT CONTROLLABLE IN WW2. Having someone able to avoid quad-50 cal AA gun fire just by spazzing A and D rapidly is stupidly aggrivating, especially when 6 paratroopers are dropping on one point and can land on the *same roof* when dropping from almost 600+ meters seperation on dropping from the plane.]Then comes the most recent rage. The pontoon-vehicle introduction. getting those vehicles was awesome. don't get me wrong. But to suddenly have Russia with the *only* water-capable tank, AND the *only* water-capable jeep that can use an MG mount on it, is far from showing a desire for ""fun"" in the game as you so callously flaunt at our faces. Germans and U.S forces were known to use snorkels on their tanks for a reason.The most disgusting thing they've done though, is the spawn change. Now you end up being spawn trapped by paratroopers and tanks more than you do getting shot by actual combatants. Not only this, but if you lose the point while you're fighting *THEY TAKE YOUR GUN AWAY* because you're suddenly in an enemy spawn zone! This leaves you completely incapable of guarding yourself while you try to get away! GIVING them a free kill! On top of this, due to the spawns being pre-determined in 2-3 locations *per mark* you will not be able to avoid spawn killers. The moment you're spotted, you're screwed. ALSO, when you end up being at your last point, you end up getting spawned several hundred yards away! So if you're the only one left defending (which happens alot) You end up running over there just to realize you're too late.In recent updates their camera has been freaking out extensively, primarily when prone on a hill or small incline/descent. This leads to your character looking like it's jerking off extensively, especially when you're trying to aim, which ends with death to you due to being unable to even fire unless you stand or crouch.TLDR for those who can't read a player's rant aka The Short Version...: 1) Underdog bonus is bugged to the Russian's benefit and has been for several months... could just be a bug, doubt it though.2) Russian players are irritating rats who don't like to lose and will enter others' factions just to rage at them in the war chats [which leads to flame wars in the chats in various languages on all 3 factions AND in support chat]3) AT weaponry is extensively out-performed where it actually counts. Russians seem to be in the lead as far as damage capability.)4) Paratroopers, especially U.S, are extensively abused to spawn kill using their M2 Carbines since they only use 5 equip slots.5) water-capable vehicles are awesome! Russia having the only water-capable tank AND jeep able to carry a gun? Not so much6) Spawn change SUCKS BALLS, and has destroyed the ability of defending troops to actually do much on the matter.7) laying/going prone on a hill is a BAD IDEA. Your camera spazzes out, and they refuse to listen when you send in a ticket about these issues. even when given video evidence of it happening on anything less than flat ground. (recent patch has ""fixed"" this issue.)Final outcomeGame: 5/5Developers: -2/5You want a game to pass the time, this'll work. Everything is acquirable free of charge, even premium time! It's just a very long grind. But be warned YOU WILL RAGE at some point for one reason or another. Don't play war without a squad of at least 3 people. And don't expect a team to work as a team.Their help desk, ticket support and reporting system are crap as well. Don't expect help when you need it, and don't expect much to happen when someone starts flipping off in the support channel/faction chats/global chats and so forth. At least they fixed the player search function next to the chat to actually see all the players in the chat, albeit it resets your search when someone new enters, which makes it just as worthless as it was. So don't expect to be able to block/ignore them unless you see them in-game.Update 11/27/2017: No differences. Still broken bias.",0

10130,Brawlhalla,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewA free, platform-based brawler reminiscent of the Super Smash Bros series. There's a wide roster of characters with multiple movesets based on what weapon they're holding. All good and well, except everything in this game is made to be absolutely infuriating.- As smooth as the servers are, the way they correct themselves means hearing and seeing an attack connect without it actually connecting. You will get a LOT of false positives in any multiplayer mode.- The casual FFA mode almost always ends up a huge cluster♥♥♥♥. Your combos will be constantly be interrupted by other people, and it will not be fun.- When a high level Ranked player enters the FFA for some reason, they will curbstomp everyone there guaranteed. Because not even the casuals are allowed to have fun.- Certain Legends have been the subject of multiple complaints due to being drastically harder to deal with compared to other Legends. Nothing will actually be done about this because this is mostly a problem at lower levels of play, and everyone knows that if you aren't Diamond, you don't matter.- The community is a cesspool of acid and salt. There is a button that will literally say 'gg' for you in the after-match chat, and players would still rather take the time to cuss you out than just press that button and leave.- Ranked is filled with absolutely awful strategies to put up with such as constantly jumping up and down and being impossible to hit, running away, camping on the side of the stage, and ONLY counter-attacking.- The matchmaking for Ranked has always been awful, matching players up with others completely out of their league. In other words, the matchmaker focuses more on speed than fairness.- A lot of Spanish players play on the English servers for...some...reason. They'll still rage at you in Spanish.The game's biggest selling points are probably that this is a free platform Brawler available on Steam, and all of the Legends are impressively balanced at high-level play. Otherwise the game doesn't bring anything new to the table, even the flashiest specials aren't that impressive, and the soundtrack is hilariously underwhelming. Long story short, if you only played Fox in Super Smash Bros Melee and think only losers or noobs play for fun, you'll probably like this game.",0

If you think this game is full of hackers, you'd be correct. That puts people away from this game. Many people also put themselves away from this game because of how difficult it can be. It has a really high skill ceiling. One of my favorite parts of the game itself is that it's a first person shooter. Dude, there's a mode that's based around medieval times with no guns. To be honest, that's probably the most realistic part of this game. No, I'm kidding, but seriously though, there's so much variety that really any type of gamer can enjoy this with practice or just messing around. If you like to play competitively, go ahead. You wanna play the game to win, but you don't want the pressure of ""being good,"" play casual. If you wanna straight up mess around, deathmatch, or have everyone on the server be friendly, go on Orange. Like cosmetics that make the game more snazzy?

836,Fractured Space,2016.0,"So far, the best free-to-play, pay-to-master game.  Also, a pretty fun space battle sim ;)  worth the initial download, though not sure how much $ it would take to equal a full game.  A tentative recommend.",1

11316,PlanetSide 2,2013.0,"PlanetSide 2 is an amazing game in every sense of the word. I've never felt the same sense of ""awesome"" in other games that this game can bring out with its sieges, massive battles, and frenzied suicidal charges. My favorite moments in this game include lying in wait to ambush a random, lone medic and almost dying in the process (I got the kill though..), and charging towards a distant base with 60+ allies while dodging tank fire, missiles, and gunship runs from above.This game causes my gaming computer such issues that I've turned all of the graphics settings to the lowest possible choice, just to minimize lag. Intense battles can still cause a drop in frame-rate, however, and I find myself losing many 1v1 fights where my comp freezes for a second as soon as the enemy begins to fire.I recommend this game for averag people, and I HIGHLY recommend this game with the people who have adequate specs to run it properly..",1

15394,Black Squad,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewNice little F2P FPS. Black Squad is essentially Combat Arms without the ridiculous limits on purchased weapons, as almost all items in the store are permanent and relatively easily acquired. The game rewards you with the secondary currency fairly frequently (namely after daily challenges, leveling up, and daily login reward) which allows you to buy the more exclusive weapons. In other words, some of the more powerful weapons. Daily login rewards do not require you to hop on every day to track, so the game does not force you to log on every day to recieve the rewards.PROS:-Great fun for a simple multiplayer FPS-Several game modes-Many maps-Large selection of weapons to choose from-Does not force you to spend money to get good gear-Plays fluidly and feels great to play overall-Most weapons are balanced fairly (for example, the M107 is one-shot-one-kill, but you cannot move with it, because if you do, the bullet will be sent into the ceiling or the floor)CONS:-Poor map design, is very easy to be spawn camped on certain sides of certain maps-You cannot change loadouts once you have picked one and spawned-Slight P2W elements, though they are not nearly as present as most other games-Balance can be a little iffy at times, some weapons are insanely accurate, for instanceGive it a go if you want simple multiplayer FPS fun. I am having an absolute blast with Black Squad.Edit: You CAN change loadouts after spawning, you just need to use F1-F3.",1

17746,Aura Kingdom,2014.0,"A beautiful game! Instead of putting a whole paragraph on how I love it, I'll just put some points down on what I really liked about it. I will also put some kind of not-so-great things here as well, so you can see if this is the game for you!Pros:1. The scenery itself is very beautiful! Each town and area has their own little thing and you can explore all of the beautiful sights!2. The enemies are very adorable! Now this isn't much of a pro to the game since enemy style doesn't really tell how good a game is, but I thought to put it out there. I feel bad killing a lot of the enemies because of how cute they are.3. There are 3 servers in a game. Each server is seperate so you can make 3 characters per server. In total, you can have 9 characters. I am a person that likes to try a lot of different classes, so this is great for me! If you're like that too, you'll love this! I know from my experience of different MMORPGs that a lot of games don't really allow this kind of thing. The only one I can remember was Fiesta online did this. I know there are a couple more out there that I don't remember. But this one does that kind of thing, so I think it's great!4.  The character design for your character and the NPCs are so adorable! I really like the character customization on this game. While there isn't too much to the customization, it's enough to make nice characters, in my opionion! I wasn't expecting something like this to have PS2 Online super ultra customization, but I was surprised to how much there was in it. So overall, its a great player maker!5. There are so many quests! Many of them are not fighting-based either, so you won't always be running around doing the same thing over and over again. You set up traps, deliver things, make things, etc. Of course, though, there will always be more fighting than, lets say, delivery quests. But, the small difference in routine gives it a little more fun! It even has a stroy questline to it as well!6. You get an ostrich. That's right. You get to ride an ostrich. This also doesn't make a game 100% better, but I think it's pretty cool that your free mount is an ostrich. 7. Another thing I like about this game is it has such a friendly environment! Many times have I made a character and at a low-level, higher ups have me join their guild or party to help me out thinking I'm extremely new. I have not once gotten into an argument with anyone. The community is great in my opinion. I'm not sure if others would agree with me because everyone has their own experiences with other people in MMORPGs, but my experience has been good so far. I'm hoping it is like this for everyone!8. You can get something called ""loyalty points"" through out the game that you can use to ""buy"" costumes! Loyalty points are free, but a little difficult to get a lot. But if you're determined and do a lot of easedropping on NPCs, you'll rack up those loyalty points and get that cool costume you wanted! They also have another point system that you actually have to pay money to get, but I think that it's great that the game developers let the people who don't pay money on games have a chance to get something cool!---Cons:1. This game does get kind of repetitive. Even though they have different quests thats not all fighting, they are usually ""get __ amount of __"" kind of quests. My higher up is aroung level 36 if I remember, and it's getting a little boring aroung there. However I do sometimes continue to log on and play. They do have ""fame quests"" and ""daily quests"" that they put up if you don't feel like doing the same old quests. (<---maybe should have put that in pros?)2. It is a point-and-click stlyled fighting game. You do have hot keys for your abilities, but for the most part, it's a point-and-click. If you're not a fan of that style of fighting in an MMORPG, then you'll probably get bored very fast.3. Laggy a bit. This might just be for me and my dumb computer. But if you have just a general computer or laptop, you may experience some lag (not too much of it unless you're in a crowded area, but thats normal for every crowded MMORPG). The cutscenes don't work for me because of it. It may be different for you though! So don't stress over this point too much. 4. Some quests require you have a party of 3. If you are a solo player like me, that may serve a problem in trying to find and work the courage to work with people. There is a party finder so you can form parties for just the dungeon. However, for me, I like doing things alone and forming parties is awkward because then I have to figure out if I should leave the party or if they still want to work together, etc. So if you're a solo player, some of these moments might not be for you. 5. Very easy. This could be a pro as well if you like things easy. Bosses are not that hard, enemies are farley easy. (I've killed an enemy about 3 or 4 levels above me with not a problem). So if you like easy MMORPGs, this is for you. But if you like a challange, this may not be it. ---Overall, in my opinion, I really like this game and I think, despite the cons, I will continue to play this game. It's very beautiful and the scenery and characters are very well made. Even though quests become a routine, they have daily quests and fame quests that break the routine a little bit. If there was a 10 rating, i think it would go about 8.5/10. I would reccomend people to give this a try and see if it is their cup of tea.",1
2011,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is beautiful for a free to play game. It's currently in alpha and is extremely well polished, they have a big update coming out in July which will make the tech tree a whole lot nicer.The game is a 5v5 space moba, it's a nice kind of medium paced style and you can just enjoy it.There are 2 lanes, each with a set of capture points and every 6 mins the mid opens up for a buff fight.10/10 everyone should try.",1

6126,Paladins®,2018.0,"The game used to be decent, but recently is total garbage. I have a little over 500h in this game, and maybe 30-40h are this year.. for a reason.Overall balance wise it is terrible, no balance changes are made in the champions and currently there are the same 10 champs rotating in the competitive, normal games are mostly for trolls. The review is mainly from a Solo Q competitive point of view. The game pretends to offer different playstyles and champions, but you can expect to be flamed for anything that is not a copied Pro build in competitive.Pros:- Free, not P2W. You buy crystals that you use to buy skins and boosts (which are rather ugly compared the SMITE ones, by the same company)- Decent graphics - a bit wooden and choppy. - Can be enjoyable if you have a group of 4 other friends and play as a team.Cons:- Toxic community. Competitive is literally unplayable. There is a certain ""Meta"" seen from the Pros and everyone copies and expects certain builds or champions to be picked. So if you are looking for a challenge and playing different champions / playstyles.. go to other game or 5ppl normal games.- Balance issues everywhere.. certain champions are insanely unbalanced and either you will never play them because always banned, or you will get to play them and just smash everything for a boring 5 min stomp.- Game is still Beta (although it is more than a year after launch) so bugs and weird hitboxes are expected.Conclusion:If you are competitive and you want to have a challenge and try out different styles - it is not the right game for you. You can stick to normal games and try different champions and builds but the trolls will always get you.",0

7482,DCS World Steam Edition,2015.0,"DCS: World is definitely an amazing simulator. It by far outclasses others due to excellent flight models, a multiplayer that makes sense, easy-to-learn mission editor, and a large amount of detail. Even Flaming Cliffs 3 aircraft have more detail than something like War Thunder.Actually, DCS excels at detail; for instance, the A-10C. It is the epitome of PC-based simulators, with most if not all of the real plane's functionality and flight characteristics. Another example is the Ka-50, and really any of the rotorcraft. They basically are the best in their class, with the full range of aerodynamic effects you'd get from the real thing- retreating blade stall, translational lift, ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥my blades just up and left me"" (hopefully not IRL), etc. Another thing is Nevada Test and Training Range. It is a huge map; most of Nevada, in fact. Even some parts of California. The entire Las Vegas city and suburbs are present and amazing. Even though it's not out for steam yet (as of updating), I'll leave this here.",1

686,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWall of Text inbound:Great game. Amazing game. I love this game to pieces.  At least I used to. The game was awesome up until recently. Than crates arrived. Actually I shouldn't blame one update I suppose. If I were to pinpoint the starting point for this disappointment, I'd have to point my finger at the introduction of the CRF. This feature, which I'd like to say was nice in concept, intensified an already present issue within Robocraft and set in motion a domino effect that more or less led to the train wreck we have before us today. The CRF allowed for the rapid deployment of ""OP"" bots or rather exploitative builds. I'm going to use the ""tesseract"" as an example. While not a huge issue on its own, it is the way FreeJam went about ""resolving"" this issue that made matters worse. To any ""veteran"" of the game that had some knowledge of the problem,  the simplest and least devastating fix would have been to nerf corner slope health to the point where use as armor would be ineffective. A more ""complex"" fix would have been to fix the exploit that allowed the construction of the buil'ds armor. Sadly, FreeJam did not choose these options and instead decided to add not 1,but 3 (now 2, but still) weapons designed to deal with these builds. While the build was successful in their intended task, they also took the rest of the games aerial population down with it. This isn't a review whining about badly balanced AA though, so onto the next nail. Shortly after this fiasco, FJ introduced ""Epic Loot"". A system widely revered as the complete opposite of its namesake. Alongside ripping out a system that was working just fine and was much simpler to balance, they supplemented this change with a system that could be best described as gambling in a system where the house wins 9 times out of 10. Instead of a system where players could either work for or pay for a specific item they desire, they are now forced to ""test their luck"" with crates. Crates that logically fail to reward a player. Common sense dictates that higher tier crates should award better loot. This makes sense. The crates FJ has forced upon us do not follow such logic. High tier crates rarely reward suitable loot, in fact it would appear, from my experience, that low to mid their crates are more likely to reward a player's efforts. This is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, period. There's also the complaint regarding the premium row ""flaunting"" items, however this hasn't really annoyed me as much as others. Moving on to the big one. A lack of communication between the community and the developers can and will be this game's downfall. If every problem listed before this were grouped tighter and weighted as a whole, they wouldn't come close to overtaking this issue. As simple as this problem is, it is so bad in FJ's case.  The simple action of posting plans for balance changes or suggestions on the games dedicated forums is so foreign to those in charge, that someone looking in from the outside, would likely see it as nothing more than a place for  angry customers to vent. Why? No devs will respond, with exception of Drognin, but it's his job as community manager (and we love him for it :3). The devs that have a proper power over the games development use Twitter instead of their own forums. It's dumb. Anyway, as if this wasn't long enough, I'll quickly list the pros and cons of the game. So Tl;Dr:Pros:1. Builders may be entertained if they get good stuff. 2. Not pay to win because buying crates just means you get more crap. Cons:1. Devs are usually silent, unless they're being praised 2. Balance weapons? What are those? 3. Exploit/meta builds everywhere. Creativity doessn't seem to be a major concern to FJ. 4. Hope you enjoy gambling. ======================I really like this game. But sadly, I can't recommend it to anyone because for 1. You're not rewarded for♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the devs don't seem to intent on fixing the issues.",0
5998,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewBless Online's publisher Neowiz pulled off the best bait of 2018 so far.This is as close to click bait you'll see from me but I promise there's a review in here somewhere.I'm not going to waste your time and explain who Shroud is, if you know who he is great, but for those that don't, context is a lot of gamers watch his streams, and thousands of them try and kill him everyday in something called ""stream-sniping""So, the creators of Bless Online, allegedly(I've reached out to both Neowiz and Mr Shroud to see if this is true) paid him a handsome sum to play the game on launch day.His popularity sold copies of the game at a meteoric pace, suddenly servers began crashing and BLESS began to look like any other MMO launch an numerous players couldn't login for whatever reason.Here's the thing. These launch day jitters were actually disguising many core issues with the game players would have immediate noticed. The game wasn't new or actually in early access it was attempting it's third launch after failing twice to find an audience, without getting into tech specs and details I'll sum it up: The game runs horribly, features static combat with awkward controls, even after rebinding keys the combos still felt horrible. It felt forced and heavy handed.It's the gaming equivalent of ""The Room"" or ""Troll 2"". It wasn't even how bad it ran, it was the hilarious expectation for players to pay for an initial copy of the game, a subscription to the game($14.99 per month), and then micro-transactions you'd expect to find in a F2P mmo.All of this paired with a murky launch and intentional obfuscation, every gamer wants to PK Shroud while he's streaming. Led to Steam lifting it's usual refund policy and refunding any player who purchased the game refund it during the grace period.I gotta hand it to Neowiz, they picked the right streamer, they just pitched the wrong game. Attached are some of the funnier things about Bless. It had exactly one redeeming mechanic, you could tame and train mounts for almost all of the NPCs.Bless Online: 0.5 out of 10 (I officially have a WORST GAME EVER PLAYED)",0
360,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewDISCLAIMER: This is all my opinion. Don't go crazy over it. Don't think i don't like this game, I love it, i'm just giving constructive feedback, and also letting people looking to play the game to see both sides. If you love the game and hate me for saying anything against it, just don't read it. Also, if i have any gramatical errors, or spelling errors, It's because i'm just throwing together this review quickly. Also use common sense.Alright. This game is bad, in my opinion. I love the idea of a fantasy battle royale, but it executes it badly. I know its only an alpha, and i will come back to this in the future, but for now it's super bad in my opinion. There are plenty of things they do right, and that they do wrong.Pros:There's a lot of good things in the game, but many of those are ideas that could be better if done another way.- I like the ability- and weapon system.- I like the map, a lot, it gives a fantasy feeling, even though it makes no sense with real world logic.- I love the idea of classes in a battle royale with a fantasy theme. They did the classes quite well with a clever way with    class weapons and abilities.- It is a lot of fun, but only when you don't die to broken weapons. I'll touch more on this later.- I like the concept of a forge.Cons:Theres only so many cons because i'm giving ideas for fixes and state things very descriptive, well, as descriptive as i want.- Controls are a little weird here and there. This can be tweaked easily, but some of it, i think, is just because of the engine.- They use the Paladins engine. I don't have anything against it, its graphics are good enough for my taste, it's just that    hitboxes can be very weird sometimes. There are other things like this too. For example, there can be a small hill, but you    can't climb it, because you will just start sliding down at the slightest, steep angle. Also, dropping out off the zeppelin is    kinda awkward. You can't really move very far. this makes it so that all those players will be very crowded.- The HUD can be quite confusing when starting off. Luckily you will learn it fast.- This game is very unbalanced. This is because it's alpha, but I will just say it still. after all, I'm reviewing the alpha version.    Some weapons are much stronger than others. Like the poison gun, it does very little damage but it damages over time.    this is weak. meanwhile, heavier guns like, revolver, rifle, shotgun and slug rifle are dominating because of high damage    and no real backlash. Another thing, the crossbow has the same damage output as rifle, but here's the thing, the    crossbow is a lot harder to hit with due to bullet velocity and drop-off. - The class- , ability- and weapon system is also quite weird, even though i like it. Like i said, they did the class system    quite cleverly, but there's some balancing issues and i both like and don't like the class ability system.   -Class problems: They're a little boring as everyone starts with the same things except for the movement ability. I'll spare    the movement ability problem for later. Also, i would want other classes. Dungeons and dragons can be a real inspiriation    for fantasy aspects for this game if you need that, Hi-Rez Studios (Know that i don't dislike your game. just giving    constructive criticism.). Also, the classes are unbalanced. Some are a lot stronger than others. Like the warrior class. that is    a lot stronger than many other classes. same with assassin. i think this is because of their abilities and stats.   -Ability problems: The way they did it, was clever. It makes sense that not everyone can learn the same spells. The thing is,    there should be a lot more spells. This will most likely be added in the future though. Also, I would like balanced spells.   -Weapon problems: UNBALANCED. That's the biggest thing i can say. Also i would like many more weapons. And another    thing, why guns in a fantasy game? I know it's a game with it's own world, and that's just how it is, but I'd prefer a more    medieval fantasy version.Now, there's a few more cons, but i hit the biggest. I'm only human, and I've gotten tired of writing this much. I don't want to write a lot more, so just write down your opinions in the comments. I have a few ideas for changes that will make Realm Royale great again. I won't write them now, but if you want them, just tell me.Summary: For now, I won't recommend the game. It's still great, but it's just a thing for the right person. If you don't like Fantasy or Battle Royales, then this isn't the best choice for you. The game is fairly unbalanced at the moment, but it will be fixed. To see all Pros and Cons, go up. I will most likely recommend the game in the future.",0

The game itself feels extremely polished for an Early Access game, the gameplay is deep/fun, and the asymetrical balance they are currently working on seems to generally function quite well.My only regret is that I did not get this game sooner.",1
12562,Path of Exile,2017.0,"I'll make my review short and sweet.  This game belongs to my favorite genre... fantasy iso arpg.  I've played nearly all of them over the years.  Others may bring nostalgia and pleasant memories, but Path of Exile is just a love letter from the developer's to that specific genre.  Personally, I think it's the best game in the genre, and it's constantly being updated and improved.  The story is great as you discover the tragic history of Wraeclast, through encountering relics during your playthrough.  The storytelling is uniqe, and it is mostly done through voiceovers so there is very little interference in actual gameplay.   The skill tree is massive and may be intimidating at first, so try going into your web browser to the skill tree calculater and mapping out a build and saving it to your favorites, then referring to it when you level up.  You gain skills through gems, as well as ways to improve those skills by linking your gems together on your armor and weapons.  The controls are responsive and intuitive and your skills/abilities make you feel powerful.  PoE is free but not pay to win but you can buy some nice cosmetic items and loot boxes.  I got me some glowy eyes.",1
1025,theHunter Classic,2014.0,"ok so i download this game despite the...3,000 and some odd number of negative reviews. And to my surprise there it is, not a free to play not a free to play with slight premium buys but a pay to win, then after 3 or so months pay to win again. As soon as i loaded the game up the first screen that pops up is the purchase screen so this tells me that this is nothing but a milk machine for the skeezy developers that made this. And once i get past that i actually get into the game and what do you know i start with nothing but my hands and a camera. So upon further investigation of the getting a gun situation i find that i have to exit the game entirely and go to the ""Launcher"" to get equipped with something. So i knew that being a free to player i wouldn't get the best. But i got the absolute worst. I got some crappy gun that looks like it was textured in PS2 era and i still have to buy ammo which costs in-game currency. So i go to buy some and nope i got no starting cash so basically it was trying to force me to pay up to get some in game currency so i could purchase ammo for A FREE GUN. I feel like this should be labeled as a bad game and taken off steam due to the 3,000 some odd number negative reviews saying it was a horrible game and nothing but a scheme to rob people. I am going to try and contact the developers to see if i did something wrong and how i can fix it and i might change my review.",0

509,Neverwinter,2018.0,"Well I played NEVERWINTER for about a week and started to get into it and then the quest tracking system broke for me. I just can no longer track any quests which used to show me where to go to resolve my quests - or even START new ones. It gives me an error message saying ""cannot find path to the quest from current location"" or something along those lines - on EVERY quest - no matter where I am. This world is far too large for me to just guess where to go - so it's effectively a game breaking bug for me. I've looked for solutions and found that many other people have the same problem but nothing they've tried (from uninstalling the entire game and re-downloading it again which took days for me) to just starting over with an all new character work for me. So I guess it's just not playable.",0

12747,WARMODE,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewHonestly, there is a bug where it gets stuck on the authorization screen, but sometimes you just need to refresh the game. It is a very fun game after that. There may be a lot of hackers, but sometimes there is not. I fully recomend this game if you do not have enough money for CSGO or Call of Duty",1
2458,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2017.0,"First Impressions review after a few days;Yu-Gi-Oh, what's not to love? overall what could go wrong?...It's not a bad attempt. ( Considering there's has been alot of attempts, should really tell you something )-Many of the rules are changed since the good old days. (Board is only  3 cards wide, so only 3 set cards and 3 monsters, no second phase, are just a few i've noticed and these are not positive changes)-The lay out sucks. ( Designed it seems mostly for mobiles devices, the play field is smaller as described above, and is squished into the middle third of your screen, with an enormous play log and card description dominating the other quadrants)-Deck size is reduced to between 20 and 30 cards per deck. ( Severaly limits options and kinda takes fun out of complex deck compositions )-Field spells do not change the graphic of the board.Some positives, yes they got somethings right.- Play mats / card sleeves options. -Ability to play with a character avatar, fully voiced is amazing, go go go Dr. C!-Ability to earn cards and gems to grind rewards is pretty fair, I guess.-Some visual representation of monsters and summons is actually nice, and a positive addition.-Voice acting as ever is top notch.Overall, the negatives detract from the game in my opinion. I find games that stream line themselves annoyingly rarely if ever do so for the better. ""Dumbing"" down the old PC version / card game for console and now even further for mobile is just weird.If they released the old PC CD version with online play, character choice, rewards, mats and sleeves and god forbid TRADING (Gasp, yes I like interacting with players beyond simply wondering through a lonely click and play random match up system where card values count for little, except to prove some land whale floated their daddy's company so they can purchase complete top end decks) , then I would give it 10/10.Instead it ends with a fair 6.5 / 10.Also, side note, beware spending too much, it would'nt be the first time a Yugi card game and been unplugged and everyone loses all their cards.....

2332,VEGA Conflict,2015.0,"I find this to be a very enjoyable game overall and I would recommend it.  I was big fan of RTS games before becoming a predominantly console gamer.  I tried a few mobile games (Boom Beach, Clash of Clans, etc) but found there was nothing ""Real-time"" about it.  Enter Vega Conflict, a game which I originally found on my phone.  I took a liking to this game due to the fact that the combat was in actual real-time, not like other games where you can only choose where to attack (and possibly redirect them slightly).  There is a lot of depth to the combat in this game, with many different ship classes, weapons, shields, and upgrades to choose from to customize your fleet.  Fleet size is limited, which I feel helps with fleet diversity and forces players to fly their ships with some skill, rather than the smash my army against your army mechanics that many RTS devolve into.  The game features monthly events that provide new technology and ship types if you are able to kill a large number of computer enemy fleets.  This game is also a social experience, as I'm sure most MMO-esque are. With all of that said, no game is perfect, and this one has some flaws.This is a free-to-play game that leans on timers; that is, you can either use your purchased ""coins"" to speed up processes (building ships, repairing ships, building your base, etc) or wait out those processess out for free.  This can create some instances where you are facing an opponent who will spend his real-world money to continually repair his ships to attack and defeat you, regardless of your respective skill levels.  The monthly events are geared toward high-end players who have been playing the game for a long time; as a newer to mid-level player, there isn't very much for you to do during these.Overall, my experience with this game has been more good than bad and I recommend RTS fans give it a try.",1
1275,Bless Online,2018.0,"tl;dr - The game is a classic MMORPG. Nothing new on the plate, nice graphics but horrible optimization regardless of build. You can take it as it is or pass on.I really wanted this game to be good, mainly because I've been starving for a good MMORPG for a while (silly me for looking at a game that recently turned f2p), but also because the lore intrigued me and, I'll admit it without shame, the graphics looked good. 30 seconds spent in the game and you'll see that yes, they do look good, but it also feels like you're constantly watching a Wallace & Gromit movie. The optimization is so poor that even people with top tier computer builds are having a hard time reaching 60 fps, let alone breaching that roof.Visuals aside (again, really good, but really choppy), the game does not appear to be anything new and it's... well, kinda boring. I know, I haven't played a lot BUT. BUT. A game should be entertaining from the get go, it shouldn't require you to put hours in just to have some fun. In all the time I played (short time, I know, but should be enough to have a gist of the mechanics) the only time I actually had fun was when I discovered that you can switch skills with the button "" ` "". That happened in the first 2 minutes. After that it's been... incredibly boring. Which is a shame, because the story sounds genuinely good and well crafted, but the story telling, even though there's a good amount of voice acting, is not gripping at all.Unfortunate.",0

They should be at least 2 or 3 times larger.Definitely following the development of this game and hopefully they bring us something cool to play on a daily base.,1
49,Aura Kingdom,2017.0,"I mean, Aeria Games not only is one of the biggest Pay2Win companies out there, they also ruined every game they've ever made:- Wolfteam- Soldierfront- Soldierfront 2- Aura Kingdom- FiestaIt's not worth the time to mash buttons over and over in a mess of an MMO where you legit do nothing but see the same animation over and over again, with the most dull and garbage combat ive ever seen. It's pointless, you wander around the map quest to quest with the most DULL story ive ever seen in an MMO, along with the combat (as I have stated) being literally button mashing instead of knowing what you're doing in a rotation like FF XIV or WoW. Of course, those 2 are different games but why include a GCD system in a Anime MMO like this when its ♥♥♥♥ing pointless? if you like using a max of 4 skills, boring story, same skill animations and numbers that go from 2,000 per hit to 500,000 in 3 hours of playtime, this is your game.

16718,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewBuild a robot, fight others creations, survive in a deathmatch, pit yourself against others in an arena, or play against the joke of an AI...  I've noticed a severe decrease in 'art' and 'creative' designs, which was something I rather enjoyed back in the day. I remember anime characters battled with galleons battled with angels battled with some of the most beautiful bots i've seen in any game. Now the gullotine has fallen, the blade has cut the creativity from the flesh of a game that used to be pretty epic. Might as well go play Mechwarrior. That's what this has become.What used to be a game that had a uniqueness and epic system for earning and battling has become something of a common scene. Freejam has made another bad decision, taking from the game the ability to earn the game credits (also known as RP) and given to it 'loot boxes' that pretty much drop... well, junk, things that can't be used or aren't worth enough to even catch the eye of a down on his luck Ferengi.I've played this game for several years, enjoyed the Megas, loved the artforms and creativity that had become prominant amongst the more imaginitive. Now... it's just another mundane game.",0
4808,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2014.0,"I, unfortunately, can not recommend LOTRO.  I really want to, but can't.  It's lots of fun, don't get me wrong, especially when played with a few friends.  But the hamhanded attempts to wring money out of the game by Turbine will be kicking the back of your seat the whole way.Look, I understand that a Free to Play game still has to make some money for upkeep costs and whatnot, but NOT BEING ABLE TO REACH THE ORIGINAL LEVEL CAP FROM 7 YEARS AGO IS A SLAP IN THE FACE.If you end up playing you will find out you can reach level 35-40, depending on how much grind you do.  The original level cap was 50.Again, I'm not saying that they should give away the expansions, thats what makes all the long term money, but not letting players reach the original base level cap, and without telling them in advance, is honestly a terrible thing to do.It has has left a bad taste in my mouth that will likely be my last inpression of this once fun game.I guess if I had to sum this up it would be...Fun, but don't let the ""Free to Play"" tagline fool you.  In order to play more than 1/3rd of the game you have to sink close to 70 bucks into it for expansion and quest packs.",0
14115,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Sadly (like REAL sadly) i had to change my review.Partially recommend the GAME. But would hate on IMC.The game is great (like i said earlier) but the company is REALLY GREED AS HELL, and dont seems to care much about their public.So, if you want to enjoy the game (at least a bit more than most players) you should buy cash. You can only sell 1 item per time at AH, and if you sell it you will only receive 70% of the money you have setted as ""price"". As it was not enough, you have to wait 48 hours to receive your 70% part of the money (i wonder that 30% goes for the goddess (only explanation i could find for that pointless tax)).So you want to borrow your friend a sword? It will lose POTENTIAL, just like when you fail to reinforce (what have you friend done with that sw!?!?)Some say that you cant even trade without cash, i cant say a thing about that cus i traded many times successfully.So, until IMC get in mind how a MMORPG works, and how you should treat your costumers, i wont recommend you the game. Its a awesome game indeed but EXTREMELY BAD ADMINISTRATED.Not to mention the bugs/lags.Below is my earlier review, i wish i can let only the below text in the (near) future as my review.--Epic game! Highly recommended.But yet (sadly), we will never have Ragnarok again, its a legend in these days, but Tree of Savior indeed made its way to bring you a nice adventure, specially when playing with your friends.The game is not too challenging as Ragnarok was, some things are pretty easy and linear, but still you have to make your own choices, and play your own style.The RPG System are very nice, inherited a bit from Ragnarok and slightly merged with ""modern mmorpg systems"", so you will have a lot of quests that you wont read any line of them, just completing and getting your reward. But the build system is not dumbed as most MMORPGs are, so you can make cool builds and test your character as much as you want.In conclusion, the only downside i see in the game is the difficulty, could be a lot more challengin, specially the bosses, they are too easy to beat, you dont need to be skilled to beat them, instead, you only need some potions and a character which can take some damage until you drain its HP.",0
3784,Shakes and Fidget,2017.0,"Classic idle game that gained almost a legendary status through the years. Doesnt change the fact, that its horribly designed. Putting aside the huge pay to win factor, it has massive designing flaws, even compared to other games of this ""not-really-a-game"" genre. The game is absolutely unbalanced in all ways possible. The algorhitm for evalutating stats in battle is horrible, huge level gaps between characters basically means that you cant even scratch your opponent. If ten 150 lvl characters barely touch a 210 lvl character in a battle, its hardly a well working curve. You are basicaly useless for your guild at a bit lower levels. Sometimes I even doubt the stats itself even matter. Dont even get me started on the character classes... There are no limits for guild (or even player) battles, meaning you can attack the same weaker guild (player) over and over and over. Because variability and not frustrated players are obviously overrated. Pet battles are horrible. You have basically no power over who you gonna fight with, so sometimes the game just presents you an oponent with pets three times stronger than your own and you cant do anything about it. Overall the pet battles are meaningless and the player plays little to no part in them. Forget pokÃ©mon, you have no control whatsoever. Dont expect to be told crucial facts about the mechanics. You have to learn most things from the internet boards, which is fascinating in the case of a casual game. Whats the probability of getting a mushroom an a quest? How many resources do I lose when a player attacks my base? Why should I give stuff to the witch? Why dont I get mana when I throw items into the toilet? Who knows? Well, definitelly not novice players. Gets slow incredibly fast. There is basically not much, that keeps you playing every day except for the quests. Base building gets quickly to the point where you have to wait days for one building to finish and you cannot advance in the pet subgame through your own will. After level 100, you just click and wait. The bookmaker is a joke. The mobile app is a bugged mess with rigid user interface. German humor is not really my cup of tea, but I am not really prudish. The problem is tho, that the game obviously doesnt know its audience or who it is trying to please. The visuals obviously appeal to younger gamers mostly, but some of the jokes are unecessary vulgar or aimed at adults. It feels out of place at times and definitelly more awkward than funny.Do I play the game? Yes, for nostalgic reason mostly and as a filler for short waiting time in everyday life. And also because obviously hate myself to some degree. But would I recommend it? Not at all. If I didnt own a decent character from my school years, I would probably never open the browser client again. I admit, I am not fond of the idle games genre, but I feel personaly insulted by the sh*tty design this title presents. I wouldnt honestly trust the developers with the new Shakes and Fidget adventure game a bit. ",0
4540,PlanetSide 2,2017.0,"Played this for over 2 years, used to be a great game. Once Daybreak took over, things started getting meh but it was still decent and playable.Then, Daybreak decided to hire one of the Youtubers called Wrel - the brain damage of this r*****ed kid who thinks he can be a developer totally broke the game's balance.Of course it did so mostly for one side - if you absolutely must play this, I recommend avoiding Vanu.At the time of writing this, VS had nearly ALL of its unique features removed (most recent removal: RIP Lancer) - the remaining ones are honestly utter cr*p (Aphelion), nerfed to oblivion (PPA, Lancer) or so very situational that they're a joke when mentioned in combat (Lasher).Hill climbing, which up till some time ago was a highly overrated ability of only Vanu (FailRaider), has been significantly improved on other tanks, strafing is a joke with the speed that tank shells travel at and the special abilities that other tanks have (anchor, shield) are SIGNIFICANTLY more useful, forgiving and newbie and pro friendly compared to what Maggie could ever offer.In terms of guns, from the experience of two VS chars (BR 120 and BR 109), one NC (BR102) and one TR (BR107): VS guns are....medicore....they do not excel at anything, supposedly jacks of all trades which is an obvious lie. VS guns also have something called no bullet drop. Yet another thing that is highly overrated because it matters ONLY on long ranges (and even at that point bullet drop is easy to compensate for after some time) but guess what - the vast MAJORITY of the game is close quarters combat. Stick your nose out of the building = die if you're not with a zerg. Why? Because of superiority of other factions' tanks over maggie and other factions' specific Harasser guns over what VS has to offer.NC guns? Heavy hitting with medium fire rate and very easy when it comes to controlling recoil. Also, Jackhammer - a BURST SHOTGUN (lol) that can kill ANY character in one mouse button click. LA1 Anchor is awesome, Gauss Saw is one of my favorite starter weapons. Remember that Deployment Shield sundy next to a base? Well, that's not a problem for a Phoenix - a rocket that you control from a safe spawn room while it's slowly flying - just get a friend to drop a C4/mines while you keep the shield down.TR? Spray and pray (hello 909rpm Lynx, 896rpm armistice)...My personal favorites here were Armistice and the >burst sniper rifle< Trap M1....yea...you can burst fire with snipers....What about Maxes? Well, NC maxes are a long known joke in-game - not in terms of 'funny' but because they have been (for sooo long) and are so OP with their instakill shotguns (and yet NC still cries about them being only CQC-only which has ages ago been proven to be a lie by a few youtubers sniping at medium ranges with Mattocks and slug attachments). Oh, they also have a special shield that blocks damage.And two laser guided rockets launchers...TR? Good weapons AND anchor (the same as their tank has - basically you cant move but you gain massive bonus to: Reload Speed (50% faster) and shell travel speed (30% faster) for the Prowler and Fire rate, projectile speed and reload time (50% faster) on a MAX). It's worth noting that you can turn Anchor on and off at any time and it takes less than 1 second to get back to the normal mode to run away. Want to block a room? Get 2 anchored maxes with pounders (aoe grenades~) and shoot at the door.But hey, what do VS have? An awesome ZOE - at max rank, this beauty gives you 10% more damage output IN EXCHANGE for....receiving 20% more damage :)And this was STILL considered OP by Wrel (that's a quote, check his videos if you wish to confirm that).If that's not enough, then take a look at aircraft - ultimate farming machines to which you will die way too often and which you will rarely ever kill because Lock Ons are so easy to avoid/counter by semi-experienced players and because they do cr*p damage (and guess what, almost noone bothers shooting at aircraft).Also, Empire Specific Fighters are damn quiet when flying slowly so they can, and will, sneak up on you and farm you over...and over...and over. Of course FailBreak fails to see how broken these are so you're stuck with being a farming meatshield for an undefined amount of time.Moreover - a while ago Daybreak implemented an anticheat drug called BattleEye into the game....This did practically nothing aside from adding an additional clogg for your CPU  - there are still tons of cheaters (check youtube for ""Planetside 2  MuscleLittleMan"" - a video from a day ago). Reporting such people does literally NOTHING - you will still see them all the time.The biggest joke was a while ago when a guy with a name starting with ""RepentForYourSinsxxxx"" literally obliterated anything and everything with an Archer (a very slow firing anti material rifle), be it galaxies, tanks, people (through walls), etc etc etc.And last but not least - the requirements...an i7 4770k WC'ed, overclocked from 3.6 to 4.5GHz with an EVGA GeForce GTX 980 Ti HYBRID WC - I had issues with keeping this game at 60 fps. And no, we're not talking Ultra settings here, no 4k or HD resolutions either (i tried this at 1680x1050 at some point but it was unplayable).So as you can see, things are going only downhill for PS2. It used to be cool, it used to be unique, I loved the long battles, the competitive gameplay and so many different playstyles and ways to approach each base but FailBreak did its ""great"" job with hiring that ******* Wrel who wrecked this decent title into the trash that it is now.Conclusion? AVOID! There are a lot better titles out there - there is no point in playing a game where the so called 'devs' create such an imbalance and claim it's all OK.Ps: large parts of the community are extremely toxic..",0
999,DCS World Steam Edition,2015.0,"I had not plaied any flight sim games in some years, until last week. My freind was talking about DCS, and being free I figured Id give it a try. Hands down the best flight sim I have ever plaied, and it has brought back the love I have for avaition. 10/10I will say  however it is not for thoses who want the casual flying of a jumbo jet, or island hopper. Even the simplified planes require a good amount of practice with, and tweaking of controls to fly well, and operate well in combat. The ""full"" sim planes are a blast to figure out and when you get it right you feel like you acomplished something. The ""simple"" planes give you the ability to get into combat faster since you do not have to spend all your time just geting an engine started, or maintaining settings while in flight. If you are looking for a real combat flight sim, this is it. ""It's just plane awesome!""",1

And if you want to play against other players have fun with that because everyone is ahead of you with enough cards to make actual constructed decks and anyone who's played MTG can tell you you're not gonna stand a chance against constructed decks using the joke of a collection they start you off with, don't touch this game until at least Battle for Zendikar hits but I have a good feeling there won't be much added I recommend waiting a year before even considering this game.",0

Its the same thing, but with a different story and its goofy-looking as always.honestly, I can look at this garbage excuse of graphics because its fun with friends around, and I like the idea of gathering around with the community and playing the game. you ain't supposed to be dedicated to the game. hop on and chat. if you got no friends, sorry for you - and you should thumbs down because you'd have no reason to play this pathetic game.But thats not to say that you can justify a thumbs down with something like this (user ""alel"" review with 0.4hours);-half baked game-boring-no multitask tracker overlay-no map-no ingame character sheet-quest completion bug-long loading for a simple graphic game, If you write something like this, you're too young to write a review anyways.

833,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access Reviewokay, review time:pros: rpg elements in a battle royale, and while still in early access already has lots of contents and ways to keep you playing and entertained for hours, specially with friends, it makes possible for lots of fun and cool moments with your most dearest friendscons: as of now there are just a few true cons in my opinion, those being some achievements being unable to achieve due to the disabling of the engineer class, so for completionists like me it tends to bother a little, same goes for the assassin being the only one without a skin to buy without ""cash"" in the store as of now, the shotgun ultra low range for stated damage, and the sniper gun shot falling, other than those there are just a few map bugs while still in early access but those probably will be patched soon.if I would give an advice to the devs: as you made skins for characters, if possible inside that selection, create other selections for weapons, so we can have weapons skins, something cool like the dead space hand cannon per example would make for a more entertaining game. if the value of skins lower or the in-game money increases, you could make the store a lot bigger with those options, making for a variety of customs, like true peasants in a realm, which would make more entertaining for people I suppose, so if I had an advice it would be to focus in variety to keep players having an goal of getting that so desired item. cause as of now, with 150-200 hours ingame which you can get in about 3 weeks to a month like I did, you are able to get all items and if you are good enough, get to master elo in all categories like me. which turns the game a little purposeless, so give more objetives to the players other than daily missions only for money.but for now considering it is still in early access, the game feels and looks awesome, you are even able to play it on a integrated graphics card (intel hd 530) with no lag whatsoever. highly optimized which is great.so for me, tldr; I highly recommend it.",1

In the end, however, skill is all that matters. If you can't fly your fleet right, no amount of cash will prevent someone from shutting you down.Being a multiplayer platform, there's also a lot of behind the scenes back-stabbing and under the table deals that can arise between the numerous alliances that are out there.

3354,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI think this is probably the best digital card game running right now.Imagine Magic: The Gathering, with Hearthstone's slick UI & interesting digital-only mechanics, while minimizing its annoying RNG elements.Very generous for free to play players, I've invested a minimal amount in this game, about $20 to unlock content I didn't feel like grinding for, and have still found myself able to construct high tier decks in a much shorter timeframe than other digital card games.That said, not sure if I'd really recommend as a game for casual play.  Generous as it is, it's still a card game, and starting a collection from 0 is rough.  The amount of time (in days) it takes for a casual player to be able to put together a competitive deck may be offputting for some.In brief: If you're a fan of Magic: The Gathering, or strategy card games in general, definitely at least give this one a try.

9698,Brawlhalla,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewPersonally, I love playing this game with my friends. However, in the interest of progression, I have a few suggestions for development of the game. Now, I'm not an expert or anything, but just consider this the thoughts of a seasoned gamer. First off, I would like too see more work put in to customizing all the characters' movesets, making each one feel more unique. Secondly, the overall movement feels a bit off. Not bad, per se, just off. A brawler needs to be a bit more fast-paced than this one is. The gravity could stand to be a bit more forceful, and a slight increase in character speed couldn't hurt, either. And finally, the maps. Now, I know this is still early access, but a little more variation would be nice. As a suggestion, what about opening map development to steam users, and a ranking system to make the better built maps show up more frequently? All in all, this is a good start, but needs some more love before it will have the kind of replay value that Smash Bros. does. I like this game, and hope the developers read this review.",1

4143,DCS World Steam Edition,2015.0,"I've only put about 20h in the simulator but so far it's really outstanding. The simulation of the aircraft feels superb, the planes look simply amazing when you're in the cockpit and the sounds are great.The systems in the aircraft all work like a charm and, atleast with most aircraft, are explained very touroughly trough active tutorials.With ""only"" 21 airports to choose from in a very big barren Russian wasteland with an ocean, mountains, hills, plains and some towns and cities it's obviously alot smaller compared to the an average commercial flightsim but I really haven't felt like I lacked space.The free part of the game also includes 2 planes and despite the fact that they don't have a full interactive 3D cockpit, the detail on the dials and systems are still top level.There's also the ability to install mods, paintjobs or even completely user made campaigns which you can even make yourself in the, what looks like, very beefy mission editor so there is quite alot of content to get trough... And that is only after you spend hours in these beautiful planes learning what every button and knob can do.And then on to the negatives and I have to be honest, it's been a very positive experience overall so far.Couple of small bugs can get a bit annoying but definitly not the end of the world. The one part where I feel it does get overly complicated is the control setup.Any flight sim will have to deal with a giant load of buttons, that's perfectly understandable, but DCS chooses to split up every aircraft and give each of them their own control screen which makes it very time consuming when there's certain buttons you have to change over and over with every plane you first enter. On top of that it can't handly azerty inputs so it's literally hell to figure out a decent profile for your joystick.All in all, very positive and definitly recommended if you're a flight simmer.",1

Although my Samsung Galaxy S5 handled the game well, once you had a big vault and all that the game got laggy and also strained your phone. I uninstalled it right away once I heard about the PC version. No more phones heating like a cooking pot, no more laggy playing with big vaults.I always knew somehow this game ended up on Steam and I waited for the Steam version until I started playing again. So what it is? The most fun and simple building simulator and the best part is the Fallout theme. It has a lot of content but you will grind like hell, micromanage and wait. I mostly do some stuff on my PC like editing photos and such, this game runs on the background and keeps going automatically until something needs to be done (Mr. Handy <3)Best part of the new features are the wasteland quests and exploring some buildings in wasteland. It's fun for first 3-5 weeks but you can get bored. Overall this game is propably one of the best mobile games ever created.

I wont say much else as experincing it first hand is really the only way to even understand what others might be saying. I wound up dying in a fashion that I didn't understand in room 312 due to an encounter, but I'll defintely pick it up again to see it through to the end.

Couldn't type anymore.So I deleted the French version as far as English is the most used langage in the world :)Be aware that I am only 18 and I self-taught English to myself, so it might be bad. FPS Amateur, welcome to CS:GO!One of the best and most popular current FPS in the World! (Please, don't get me wrong and don't say that I said it's the < Best Game ever > :P)As far as I know, I am not a big fan of FPS games, which show how much this one is a good one :DBut don't get me wrong. I won't say only good stuffs about this game ! ^^I wanna insist on the fact that the game is only $14,99 and can lower to 7~8 in Steam Sold! :)The good stuffs about CS:GO:- As far as we know, CS:GO, in contrary to most of FPS games, is not a Pay²Win.The only few stuffs you can get are skin stuffs. (Weapon cases, skins, keys...) which is only useful for cosmetic!(I beg you to not judge people that pays skins.It's like judging people that buy games massively, have knives collection in real life, car collection... or even just even buying games at really high price that are not worth it! ^^)Which can be nice to have too! :D- The game is based on real skills.Bye, bye, games with broken weapons only with Zomms on it! (Even pistols :P) There might be two or three weapons that way, but not every weapons has one!The whole game would only depend on your skills that you'd grow by time!Your reflexes, your precision, hearing where the enemy steps are perfectly, the weapon shots are master words!- Many maps available.The rank system 5v5 allows you to chose any map you wish to play one what is available.Most of them are balanced, some a re not either. But there is always a way to be good at both sides with a few trainings!- The Workshop allow the community to make many maps to train your skills and become one of the best player of CS:GO!Headshots, perfect spray, and every kind of training that would make you a better player!- New cases shows up regularly in game.Players can drop them in game (normal or ranked one!).What's the good point about that?If you drop the in the first hours they show up, you can sell it until $30! (Yes, I saw that! :P)And then, when it spread itself more, the cost would quickly lower to around $8.And one week later, the price would be around $1.So, try your luck on the first days!- Last part of the good points:Rankeds are really nicely optimized.One game 5v5, you can kick negative players.If they are an AFK, he'd be auto-kick after 2 or 3 games.If you don't want to wait, you can kick him.Otherwise, he may comeback in the 5 next mins. ^^If he doesn't, oh well he gets a ban.The Team-Kill system is kinda stupid.You can kill your teammates, (which can add difficulties. Which is understandable.)But, of course, it becomes a ban reason. If you kill 3 teammates (or if you do too much teammate damage in a short amount of time) you'd get banned.The bans system work that way:1rst ban: 30 minutes.2nd ban: 2 hours.3rd ban: 1 day.4th ban: 7 days.Do not worry, there is no permanent ban!The next ban could be just a little 30 mins even if you had one before! It reset itself after a little amount of time being clean. :)(Those bans work the same for when you leave a game ^^!)  Negative facts: - I'm gonna make it simple..Of course, one of the major problem of the game is, the smurfs and the hackers.Most of time, they are smurfs (coming from the Rank Supreme or Global which are the highest) that have fun to play against Silvers on another account.I don't find this funny because that happen almost everytime. ^^But, don't give up!Just because they are smurfs in enemy team doesn't mean you can't win.Every players have a weakness. You just need to find it.- Les hackers.Bien qu'il y a un système de VAC, souvent des hackers ne se feront pas arrêter.Heureusement, cela ne se passe pas dans chaque game donc en général vous pouvez jouer paisiblement.Et s'il y a un hacker, y'a des chances qu'il se fasse ban pendant la même game.- Hackers.Obviously, they are a VAC system. Most of time hackers doesn't get arrested by it.Gladly, you don't get to see hackers every game anyway. So, in general, you can play peacefully.And if they are an hacker, they are some chances that they gets banned while you're playing the game against them.- Some players ruining the community.Most of players would say that it's Russians or Polish players's fault.But they are not only them.Lots of french, lots of germans, lots of portuguese..It comes from everywhere!There is no perfect community.They are only mentaly disturbed people. oAoThanks god, there is a ""Mute"" button! :)Anyway! I am gonna stop here. There is lots of stuffs to say about this game but it's already a very long review! :)Good luck, have fun to the few people remaining that are going to buy the game :) ",1
4265,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"I really like this game. I've liked it since it was orignally released. I still like it. But there is one HUGE issue with this game. It's not a design flaw, it's a bug. And i'm not talking about a glitch, i'm talking about an ACTUAL BUG. The radroachs have a wierd issue where one ends up invincible. I lost at LEAST 10 people to one Roach because it wouldn't die. I had five dwellers in the same room ALL WITH GUNS and they couldn't kill it. When it finally left, I figured it would be over, but NO. There was ANOTHER invincible radroach that almost got me, but I just closed the game; And apparently, this has been a problem since 2015! It's ridiculous! Still recommend the game though, it's pretty fun.",1

I totally bored using a smoke grenade over and over again but that kind of noob never use any other weapon and some idiots call this a tactic. Second thing, people writing their mother tongue in waiting list chat! I warning  them so many times, there are other people here from different countries but they won't listen and they Insist to talk their own language!

10987,Minion Masters,2017.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewA classic pay-to-win game obtained from the latest PC Gamer magazine.There's no replayable solo mode, once you're through with that, you won't get any more rewards for playing the same matches. It serves as a testing ground for any new deck concepts you come up with, that's it.The only way to progress is to battle randomly online and specifically win. Which leads to farming the lower ranks so that you can get the coins to buy a new roulette-spin to get more cards.You can, however, pay money for rubies, which you can convert directly into these roulette spins, thus neatly skipping the arduous grinding bit of the game.Daily challenges which also give rewards help to hide these issues, but ultimately this will sit in my 5-minute-game category.

11571,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"Nice little game about clicking to get resources in an endless turn of repetitive events without a real story but fixed-steps quest lines.I've enjoyed very much exploring other places, but maintaining the bunker becomes a chore after 4-5 hours. You have many choices and action and such, but it feels very soon like you go into maintenance mode.

3795,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThere was HUGE potential! and I mean EUGE! But failed to be the game it felt it needed to be. Fortnite and PUBG are great games on their own, but Ring of Elysium feels as if you mushed the two together and added snowboards. The primary issues are bugs bug BUGS! I love me a good pasta, but DAG-NABBIT! IF there's bugs riddling my Fettuccini, I'm going to get my knickers in a bunch! Combat is a joke, Mobility is a joke, and quite frankly if you wanted to play a better Battle Royale game for free, you could just play Fortnite. OR you could play PUBG for a cost. but either way, prevent the stomach and heart ache later and just avoid this game. The beginning screen felt oddly familiar, and I mean REALLY familiar. Theres this in game currency you can use to buy things in the store... that doesn't exist yet, and as you level up by playing the game, you unlock skins, emotes, colorful items, and bragging rites. but if you wish to pay for the V.I.P version, you can get more rewards, more skins, and that means more fun! right? Skins=Wins so therefore you get the skins... except theres only 3 base skins in the game. And there are about three color options for each of them. Overall, it's just a buggy game, and too underdevoloped to receive any good comments. Copy and paste games should go where other plagerized items go. The disposal.",0

5551,Bless Online,2018.0,I waited for this game to come out. I was stoked about the combos and the new story etc. Then it releases and i think well lets give it a week before i pay money for it. Then the horrible reviews started to show up and steam even offered full refunds to those poor souls that paid for this crap. THen i hear that it will be a free to play come Ocotober. At last im excited to play the game finally. It finally finishes downloading and I boot it up. First 3 times i launch and it craches every time. I make sure everything on my end is good ( which it was ) and then tried again. Finally get into the game and start making a character and everytime i click a new race or class it freezes for a second. I hope off to try again the next day and it wont open yet again. So now i uninstall this game without even getting to play the real content and will likely never know how lame this game really is because it cant even launch.,0

Some good ones and some bad ones. It's a very great game to be honest and I would recommend it. Sure there has been some bad changes but keep in note that this game has many people playing it after 10 years. Many people do not realize that. If you are new to the game just ignore the idiot ""experienced"" players calling you noobs. I respect every f2p and most p2ps. Most of the older players may think they're better than you and may try to kick you or target you and well they're idiots. The community has bad and good people in it.

19182,Robocraft,2018.0,"This game used to be so much fun. That was back with the tiering system. You were able to unlock different tier weapontry, parts, and blocks and there was so much diversity with the game. After the lootcrate update the game was ruined. Everyone lost all thier parts and weapons, and the diversity of parts is so much smaller now. I lost all of my robots, most of my parts, all of my blocks, and was forced to start from scratch. I dont know what the devs were thinking with it, but this game is ruined and there is nothing really anyone can do realistically other than reverting back to the old tiering system. In fact that is the only thing they can do to save this game now. All I can say is I'm disappointed in everyone involved in the making of this game. You had one job, to keep the game fun, balanced, and fair, and you went out and did the opposite and destroyed it. Shame on you.",0

8410,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Hello friends! This game is one of my favorites. I've invested a ton of time into it and still play pretty much every night. Its a swirling melee of a game with plenty of depth to the combat with plenty of strategy and tactics to play with. So if you read no farther then know my opinion is: yes get it and start playing. This game is also 100% free to play! With absolutely no pay to win involved. Crew and ships as well as alternative load outs can all be purchased with in game earned credits (earned just by playing, which is why you are here right?) You can use money to speed things along, but mostly money gets you cosmetics. Some of which are really cool and lovingly made. And no ship is truely 'better' than all the others. The models and graphics in this game are georgous. It plays smoothly and is well optimized. It is still technically under development and so a lot of things have changed since i got here. But honestly it is amazingly polished. And at the time I am writing this things are in a great place. The balance is solid, with a few ships over preforming and a few under preforming. The thing that really sells this game for me isn't the team play (though I love that) or exciting combat but the unique way good piloting can turn a ship from average to unstoppable and how great tactics and strategy can make or break a team.

Although the intended gameplay and mechanics of the game are brilliant I find I rarely get to enjoy them due to glitches, lag and some issues with balancing games. The pay to win system is slightly annoying and bias on teams (e.g. giving Russian infantry a small tank). THis of course is all expected in open-beta games, so I was rather suprised to find the game launched a few days ago even through a lot of these problems still remain and my friend wasn't able to join a match.

It looks very nice and it's more realistic compared to WoT.Sadly, the match making in this game is horrible. When you start out, the most you have to worry about is making sure you don't die and everyone is pretty much on the same level. The MOMENT you research a Tier 2 Tank/Plane however, it throws you in the deep end and puts you up against people who have unlocked Tier 4 and 5 Tanks/Planes, of which the Tanks can one shot anything ranked below them, and the Aircraft battles feel like you're a grunt going up against Team Starfox (and no amount of barrel rolls will save you).Plus, whenever you get a new Tank, it's a load of garbage, and the only way you can research the parts needed to make it better is to take it into battle, which means you're playing at a disadvantage till it's fully upgraded, and, usually, by the time that happens, you've researched a new (and probably better) tank to replace it.It's a shame it had to end this way, as I was really enjoying myself and felt like I was getting somewhere, but the minute the bulls**t hit the fan and the rage enducing Tier 5 Tank one shots started happening, I dropped this thing like a bomber payload, without the satifying explosion.",0
1945,Dungeon Defenders II,2018.0,"I likeable free to play game that mixes tower defense with 3rd person slashing and some rpg elements like stats, loot and stat points. Give it a try, it's free. You start the game with 4 different characters, each character has 4 battle skills and 4 buildings to build. There is a campaign, then the so called Trials, then Incursions, also mastery stages and then the Onslaught. There are a lot of things to  do and you can play up to 4 people, which makes it easier to clear stuff since you have more characters on the field to do damage. There is of course a shop and a medal/gem system going on as in all free games. Pretty much everything in the game can be bought with the in-game earned Defender Medals, but you can also spend the real currency Gems to buy the stuff without the effort. Some people don't like systems like thi but I thik it makes it fair. There are characters to buy, costumes and cosmetics, shard packs, special pets and so on. If you want. I've bought 2 characters with real money and unlocked 2 with in game currency, there are of course daily and weekly missions you can compete to earn more medals than t he ones from the maps.

The Mustang is also a good place to start.4- There are beautiful and realistic collection of modules that can be purchased.5- Manuals look cool on a desk when printed.7- Since you saved some money not paying for the game itself, and before you get sucked in and buy every single airplane available, invest in a quality joystick.*The Steam version of DCS rarely get modules and updates on time, expect to wait a lot of time for new airplanes.",1

You can easily defeat those with superior equipment if you know how to do so.+ Fun infantry combat with a variety of classes which all have their own uses and importance on the battlefield.+ A variety of vehicles and air assets with customisable weaponry, equipment and abilities to fit roles that you desire, such as AA tanks or Ammo resupply Sunderers.+ Each faction has some unique vehicles and weapons specific to them which are more of less balanced.+ You have the ability to make your own bases, though this is something+ The maps or ""Continents"" are huge. Bases vary in importance and have lattice links so there is a sense of progression when taking them and involves strategic thinking.+ Any minor event such as sneaking around your enemy on foot and destroying a sunderer can have a significant impact of the battle for the entire continent which can give exhilarating feelings.+ There are many organised outfits and platoons on every server with every faction that are friendly and willing to take on new players, but also there is the freedom to play solo. Play how you wish to.+ If you are willing to pay for them, There is a wide range of cosmetics that give you the ability to stand out.+ Out of the 800+ hours I have played this (200 hours before realizing it was on steam), I have only ever encountered 1 hacker who was in a flying max, which was in 2014. They have implemented an anti-cheat software to mostly prevent this further. So hackers are ""Rampant""? Not a chance.= Updates are few, but do happen. Does not help that Daybreak is not exactly an extremely wealthy game company so they are limited in their ability to do massive overhauls on a frequent basis.- Bugs and Glitches occasionally occur, such as touching a vehicle wreck with your own vehicle causes yours to explode and getting out of a vehicle in an awkward place such as a very narrow gorge can make you fall through the map.- Sometimes people on your own faction grief and TK or have an overwhelming desire to get a pointless revenge, such as accidently running someone over in a vehicle or kicking them out of your vehicle then a minute later they C4, Fire rockets at or throw Tank mine at you.

Another thing about this game is it has a rp comunity.

7668,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,"THE GOODTeam Fortress 2 is not your ordinary game. Focusing on its cartoony graphics, offbeat humor and wide variety of game modes and player classes, but it will definitely put some people off. If you're a person who likes team-based multiplayer first-person-shooter video games, I think this game is for you. The sound in the game is exciting overall together with the visuals.  It's a perfect game. You are always updated with new incredible releases. Last but not very least, a very fun and unique shooter with cool mechanics and great teamplay is totally free to play.THE GREATThe game can be addictive and challenging if you let it. The game is very fun, with different characters and balanced. One of the best Games of all time for sure. People who call this game or boring don't know much about shooters to be honest. Each class is a really funny, cool and interesting character with an unique and awesome personality. You're not running around with an AK47 or M16, but with Syringe Guns and Sticky Bombs, it's quite hilarious. Not to mention its great item-drop system, an amazing fanbase and the community, they are the perks which keep the players from all over the world to play this game.THE UGLYThere is no serious gameplay whatsoever. If the developers wanted players to have a real serious gameplay, they would have made an in-game system where players get penalized for quitting the game before the match ends. Face the facts: You can disconnect the current game any time you like even in MVM matches. Perhaps for dynamic joining and disconnecting of players of the current match, but it can be frustrating when you spend the whole damn match without stable players.GameplayMost Team Fortress 2 game modes have 2 opposing teams, the Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED) and the Builders League United (BLU), that compete against each other in various maps to complete certain objectives. Some game modes include:Capture the Flag: Each team attempts to steal the opposing team’s intelligence briefcase from their headquarters and secure it back at their own base.King of the Hill: A central point must be captured and defended for a set amount of time to win the round.Payload: One team attempts to escort a rail cart filled with explosives to the enemies base.Team Deathmatch: A team is able to win a round by killing off the members of the opposing team.CharactersThe players on each team must choose a class to play, each with their own set of abilities and special weapons.Medic: Heals fellow teammates with a Medigun that can ÜberCharged to make other players temporarily invincible.Scout: Runs very fast and is able to double jump. The Scout default weapons are a shotgun and baseball bat.Heavy Weapons Guy: Also known as just “Heavy”, this is the largest and slowest moving of the classes. He wields a minigun and boxing gloves, and can recover health by eating sandwiches.Pyro: Wears a gas mask and fireproof suit while wielding a flamethrower and fire axe and is best at killing enemies up close.Engineer: Can build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers that aid other teammates in battle.Sniper: Can kill enemies from far away with his sniper rifle. Enemies can be killed with one shot if they are hit in the head.Demoman: Wields a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher that can be used to kill enemies around corners, or lay traps for enemies to run into.Soldier: A rocket launcher equipped brute that is capable of reaching great height by jumping while firing a rocket at the ground.Spy: Can disguise themselves as members of the other team, and can kill enemies with one hit if they manage to sneak behind them and stab them in the back. Can “sap” Engineer’s buildings to quickly destroy them.",1

I can firmly say that this game is absolutely fun to play, however, unless you're willing to put much of your free time into this game, you won't go far. It's not a game for people who just want to pick this game up and play it. You need to invest time ( or money : Will talk about this in a bit ). With almost 300 hours, although I have almost all the playable unlockables ( ever class unlocked excluding Vanguardian ) and many cosmetics ( Mastery 298 - you gain these mastery points from cosmetics and leveling up ) I am nowhere near ""end game"" for an MMORPG - Although I have access to all the content, I just cannot deal enough damage to be invited to late game runs. A, because I don't have time to grind CONSTANTLY, and B, I don't spend enough money. You can get anything in this game over time, without spending money, however it's tedious because getting better is much on RNG without spending a ton of money.Gameplay wise, this game is really nice 6/10, however if you don't want to spend more than $50 on this game, it would bring you almost no fun without 300+ hours4/10 overall.",0
11817,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016.0,"This community is rapidly going to hell...Its quite apparent that the so called Professional players of this game over 65% are hacking which can be viewed on youtube which the Developers allow them to do such as its consistently brining in revenue.Average Player base these people tend to buy seperate accounts to play with lower ranking players to make a name for themseleves of how great they are. Streamers tend to get carried to ranks that they can't play at and then state how they are having a bad day because the people who carried them to that rank can't play with them that day. The lower end players the brand new players tend to buy game hoping to have fun and get trolled all the time.

This should be 2 separate issues, If i kick someone for being an♥♥♥♥♥or going afk too many times and per that week I am already on a 2 hour ban from leaving a game I then recieve a 24 hour ban. So say you have a player that goes afk mid game how do you get rid of him wait til he disconnects to be able to use a bot to even the playing field. However this game allows you to mess with settings in console so now you have players going afk the whole game by running in circles in spawn thus never leaving due to creating an action in game. So the only resolution is to kick them...However if you have kicked multiple people or in that week's time had a cooldown you will get a much longer cooldown for doing something postive.Gun drops in game have been reduced it use to be you would recieve between 4-6 drops a week now your lucky to get 2 drops usually cases which require a $2.49 key to open. So as this has gotten less and less the Community has begun promoting underage gambling websites to gamble your skins in hopes to getting better skins to make profit off of game. Which is disturbing when you connect to the game and you hear a 9 year old talk about his up's and down's with gambling his skins away....I would not recommend buying this game unless you intend on being a troll and can stand not getting agrravated by other trolls on this game.",0

1402,War Thunder,2016.0,"Where can I start with War Thunder? Well, I'll start with the basics. I stopped playing about 3 months ago and the whole game has changed. When I stopped, you had 20 plane tiers. This meant that when you go into battle, you were fighting people in the tiers one below you, same as you, and one above you. What this did, was allowed you to fight planes of similar ability. Now, you have this 5 tier system, which is♥♥♥♥♥♥ No other word for it, it's just♥♥♥♥♥♥ Seeing it on Steam, I redownloaded it and played in what is now called Tier 2. What happens now is that instead of playing 3 tiers out 20, you fight against 1 tier out of 5. This means you are fighting people in planes that could have been 4 tiers above you in the old system. For instance, you could be in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bi-plane just out of WW 1 and someone in a Mk 1 Spitfire can come up behind you and one shot you. I really did love playing the short time I played. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED IT! But the problem is, I can't love something that has been developed by people who don't listen and don't think♥♥♥♥♥♥through. I cannot imagine playing it for more than 24 hours, which is incredibly short for a game. If you're bored and have an evening to yourself, definitely play it. It's f2p and good fun and the start.

3468,Creativerse,2017.0,"Tbh, this game has alot of potential, it is a pretty good game, different enough from minecraft, the graphics are very good, the soundtrack is amazing!

The recepy things can get pretty annoying because you need to craft something that can be pretty expensive to get something you really need, which can be pretty annoying but nothing horrible, there is no goal at all, yes there is some hidden story in this but...that's really not what you could call a goal, i mean you can set yourself a goal but, i mean, that's pretty, i don't want to be rude but that's kinda...lame, other than that this game has alot of potential and i hope the next update will bring many more things!

Eventually sh*t starts getting creepy: ""things"" start chasing you and, as research lab databases show, there are tonnes of monsters to come the deeper you go. I loved the mini-games: a great relief from the game's jump scares.Although I think jump scares are cheap, and far too many games use them and go on to tag them as a ""horror"" games (FNAF), this game uses them effectively: creating an eerie atmosphere and making you jump out of your chair at even the cutest cardboard cut-outs while being chased by a head-eating (Resident Evil-like) monster.This game has a strange effect as I want to continue on ""just one room more"" I tell myself even though that one room could either be a single corridor (which I nervously walk down) or a dark room in which you magically obtain a flashlight(???) Worth the £000.00 I invested and I'm looking forward to the 1000th room (if I ever get there). Game-play: 8/10Helpless at the start.....and so far still like that. Controls are simple but work effectively.Graphics: 9/10Simple cartoons at start but develops to much darker images.Polish: 8/10Funny (Spooky girl), Detailed backlog of each monster and Fear. What more to ask for?",1
16618,H1Z1,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewBeen playing for 12 hours, and nothing but sheer dissapointment. There is litterally no lag compensation, so unless you live in places other then where the servers are located you can forget it. There is a serious need for bug reviews! the fact that i have to delete app data every time i want to launch the game, as well the fact that you tend to fall through the floor and get  no hit reg. This game honeslty sucks huge dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and i wouldnt reccomend it to anyone. I cant believe what a waste of time this game is.",0
2423,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"As a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls universe this game was a huge attraction to me! It's really personal preference whether you play this, magic or hearthsone etc but each game has its unique way of gathering new players such as the double laning system in ESL. The story has many tough yet doable quests for you to do and they're many different ways to test out new decks created, vs AI or actual players. There is a nice casual game mode and even ranked too, and also there is a nice addition of Solo Arena which pits you versing tough AI characters with the mission being that you have to beat as many as you can before you lose 3 times. Each time you succeed or lose in your journey you garner great rewards. The deck system is extremely diverse which allows for great consideration and mixing for deck creation. Overall this would be my favorite Card game in its current genre. 8/10",1
8510,Trove,2017.0,"This game is great. For anyone that loves to become more and more powerful by leveling up and playing with friends, this is the game for you. For anyone that loves to get endless loot and strive to become one of the most powerful players, this game is for you. But there's a small problem. This game is entirely a money run. I don't think I've ever seen a game that is more pay2win than this one. You can literally buy yourself to being some of the most powerful players in the game, despite all those players that choose not to spend any money. Most people who say this game isn't pay2win are people who have spent hundreds of dollars themselves, choosing to deny their own waste of money. For anyone that still thinks this game isn't controllable with money, look at the ""shop"". You can buy all classes, infinite ""gem dust"", and anything else you need to become maxed out. So unless you want to play this game for three years straight while grinding for what seems to be for a fraction of the power the pay2wins have, be my guest and waste your time.The keyword here, in case you didn't catch it, is: pay2win",0

10075,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2016.0,"Product received for freeGreat game overall but a word of warning, this game is not very welcome to beginners at RPG genre. The complex skill systems, how to get around the map without getting lost is very complex and copious as this game is literally the LOTR scaled to what its supposed to be.The Atmosphere and enviroment is a great thing to enjoy and explore but there are pro's and cons as many games do. Some suggestions could be that they update their combat system and explain to players how everything works clearly as I stumbled a lot through the game not knowing what are how to interact or do certain things. Other things that would be great if they would give discounts on the monthy subscriptions at certian times or events, as it is annoyance that certian interactions would not be available.",1
689,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2015.0,"This is the best sim since Grand Prix Legends. Simply the most fun you can have with your clothes on. Period. If you love race cars & racing this is as close as you can get to the real thing. They even give you a couple of tracks &  3 cars for free, Whats to complain about. Yes Multiplayer is in alpha. So if you do that then you can expect problems. But the single player game is great against the ai. Works fine & is stable on my Pc. Try it. You won't be disapointed. But as said by others. Buy your upgrades direct from the games website. Not through Steam. You can purchace from your steam wallet. It's not perfect yet there still working on it. But it is good.... Very good! Bought some tracks including one I've actually driven on & it's spot on. When you crash it doesn't even cost you anything!!!! Hell I love this game already & I only had it a few days! Works well with a joystick. So you don't have to spend a fortune on a wheel. Now I've got the thing calibrated good bye life...... :-) Sure if your looking for arcade forget it. You will hate it. Go and waste your money on something else. Bore your brains out after 15 hours. This will take you that long to get into it. Trust me I'm only just starting. This can only get better, With more tracks coming online all the time it will be alot better. And when they sort the multiplayer........... Bought 7 tracks & 20 cars for Â£20 so don't believe the doom merchants. Much cheaper from the games website than on steam, This is one game I don't mind paying for DLC''s as it will keep the game in developement. Real world physics. Awesome sound that deserves some decent speakers. And after all they give you so much for free. How you can whinge about that. If it doesn't work on your system then at least it hasn't cost you anything. I have paid good money for other race games that won't even run on my Pc or have no controller support. This game is quality.",1

10663,War Thunder,2016.0,"I'm trying to write a review somewhat base on my experience. For playing almost 3 yrs grinding with the Germans, Americans, British and the Japanese but not the Russians because i don't have the time and interest.Whether is tanks or aircrafts each faction has its own ups and downs. However every battle i jump into, the Russian will win often whether is alone or joint with other factions. Maybe it could be map design or people complaining about broken MM(Match-making),FM(flight model) and many things in the game if you read the forums in the communitiy. For the most important part is that i refuse to believe ""Russian Bias"". You can win by communicating to team, best played with a friend through Skype or Teamspeak. It takes skills and observation in the battlefield and knowing the weakspots of your enemy. But now due to recent updates and horrible fixes of the game it became somewhat unbalanced mostly Match making and the graphical glitches where you see your enemies behind a wall or bushes when you are not aiming your gun sight. Sometimes the hit detection doesn't inform you whether you make a confirm hit of the target or not. Not to mention the amour physics can be a bit whackky.

Trying to play with a friend is nearly impossible with all the things that could go wrong connecting. A lobby type system makes more sense to me, I don't get why multiplayer is set up how it is. Also you can't choose what mana to tap, often the computer will tap a land type that you might need later in the turn.

I don't play many EA Games games, so it's possible one of those series is worse, but I don't know about it.  If someone rates this game positively, it's because Magic is a great game.  My hrs on record is a testimate to that.If there were a chess game on steam that had terrible features (like no game types, terrible match making, no options, and a terrible interface, and some edge cases of the actual chess match were bugged) many people would still give it a positive review because chess is such a great game.

16918,Bless Online,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis game was a mess at start but I respect the devs for their grind on the weekly patches so far they have been awesome with keeping everyone updated and listening to the community,1
186,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015.0,"After several hours in this game, all I can say is that this game has the absolute worst community I have EVER SEEN in my entire life, and worse than Call of Duty's, Battlefield's, PAYDAY 2's, Team Fortress 2's, or Left 4 Dead's.CS:GO's community is the living embodiment of EVERYTHING that is wrong with the gaming community.You get insulted by either your teammates or the enemy team for EVERY little thing, on Casual, and ESPECIALLY in Competitive, and you can't mute them either because you have to somehow find some useful information that's buried underneath the childish and immature insults from these manchildren and kids that love talking♥♥♥♥♥♥because you can't physicallly punch them in the face in real life because of distance.The virginity, girlfriendless, sexism (I've seen really immature and horny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that prey on girls, and I've also seen stupid, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, attention seeking girls on this game as well that bait guys), anti-social, fanboyism, nerdism, sociopathy, childishness, manchildishness, and immaturity are at maximum here in this game.Then there's these clutch or kick nerds that can't ever give you a ♥♥♥♥ing chance and are constantly pressuring you and cause you to fail, then they put up a votekick against you and kick you out for losing ONE round even though you're most likely leading and carrying the entire team, and winning the match as well, and it's worse if you're in a Competitive match when this happens because of the ♥♥♥♥ing cooldown system, which is another issue with this game. You can even get banned for votekicking too many players or get banned when it's not your fault (say the power goes out or your PC has to restart and are unable to make it back in time, or need to leave the match for something important in real life.) And that♥♥♥♥♥♥can last up to 1 hour to 7 damn days.Then there's these rank nerds (honestly the worst part about CS:GO) who love to belittle others (especially towards Silvers) because of their rank as if a ♥♥♥♥ing rank in a VIDEO GAME means something important in real life. If you want a rank that actually means something, then join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the police, you know, REAL LIFE situations that actually MATTER.This game isn't very friendly to newcomers of the series either, as they also get insulted for not being good at a game they're NEW to and/or being a Silver rank.Again, join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the ♥♥♥♥ing police if a rank matters so goddamn much to you.And let's not forget Community servers either, which are chock full of power-hungry and abusive badmins (one of the things ruining Battlefield 4), that abuse their admin powers, mute people, slap, damage, kick, and ban people because they think admin powers makes them above human rights. You're not a ♥♥♥♥ing cop, you're an admin of a server that means literally nothing, and I hope you NEVER join the police force despite me saying that you should join them if ranking means so much to you. And if not for anything, people will always find SOME ♥♥♥♥ing reason to try and♥♥♥♥♥♥you off because they're too busy being the basement dwelling failures at life that they really are.Valve clearly doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about anything other than milking this game like a ♥♥♥♥ing cow to line dumbass Newell's pockets for his next McDonald's purchase (when honestly, this fatass should instead be getting himself a gym membership), because instead of fixing issues in the game that break it and allowing the game to be modded (like how Source, Condition Zero, and 1.6 could, and those were WAAAAAAAY better games than this horsevomit), they'd rather stick to releasing Operations and crappy knife models, and weapon skins (AKA DLC's) to milk every cent out of CS:GO, which is the very same cancer that's killing off TF2, and I'm surprised they cared enough to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing netcode and hit boxes in this game (which was another major issue plaguing the game for a very long time).Seriously, look at the ♥♥♥♥ing prices in the Steam community market for CS:GO, and you'll see skins that'll rise up to $400 maximum. Seriously? $400 for a ♥♥♥♥ing Karambit knife spray painted blue with StatTrak?I literally can do all of that with a Karambit in real life for less than $50, but these CS:GO nerds and fanboys want to draw the ""supply and demand"" card as if this were a real economy and like this♥♥♥♥♥♥actually mattered as opposed to playing the actual game itself.This is the absolute worst game Valve has ever produced, and it's all thanks to the community, because to be quite honest, when you're NOT surrounded by and dealing with the ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal community in this game (which is rare), this game can actually be VERY fun and engaging (like the CS I used to know back in the 90's and early 2000's) as well as enjoyable.I was actually VERY excited to hear about this game coming out back in 2012 until I realized how bad Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up with CS:GO and how the community increases the destruction by 150%.This game has legitimately caused me a lot of stress (and I mean legitimate stress) from the idiots I meet whether it's in Casual, Competitive, or Community servers, I can't get away from the Internet tough guys and keyboard warriors who I'd love to put on life support.Hell, I even have a video posted on YouTube on how awful this community is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJBNjy5Ahg8And that video is just the tip of the iceberg of how ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious this community is.DO NOT even consider buying this regurgitated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's not worth $15, or even $0.01 of anyone's money.It's ♥♥♥♥ing cancer in software form.Again, invest your money in CS 1.6, Condition Zero, or Source, you know, the REAL Counter-Strike games and actual GOOD games that's worth money.And I bet you the neckbearded CS:GO fanboys who are still fat virgins with no girlfriends that dwell in their parents' basement all day are going to get butthurt and activate their defense mode and attack this review.Honestly, go ahead, I don't care, because you're only proving my point on how pathetic of a community you kids are considering one of you fanboys wish cancer on me over a VIDEO GAME.UPDATE: So Valve a little while ago released an update that fixed all of the hit registration issues that I spoke about earlier. They're definitely taking a step in the right direction and the game itself has been improving greatly, but one thing, which is unfortunately out of Valve's control is the community. It is still the very same toxic and cancerous community as I've stated earlier. Situations like this make me wish there was a yellow button instead of just a red and green one, because while the game is great, I can only recommend it to people who can get past this terrible community.",0
1128,School of Dragons,2014.0,"SERIOUSLY!!! Ok first off ad's pop up every so often, you even get single time offer things. Truly mean't for 5 year olds. Why, because this game teaches you about things that should not be in this game this therefore reduces the lore to the movies by well about 67%.POINTERS for the DEVS:1. Don't teach gamers stuff. PERIOD.2. Free up the game a little bit, give some freedom to the players of this game.3. Less ads and more of the the lore and freedom (like before).4. Less offers to buy stuff for money. (I understand you want to make money and all but people who play video games HATE ADS AND RANDOM POP-UPS THAT KILL THE GAMEPLAY!!!)5. I haven't got far enough to see if this is actually a feature but, Free (flying) roaming, like... Exploring berk while flying on your dragon.Summary:It's a great game but... Has olmost every aspect of a Pay-to-win game. If your Kid or yourself is stuggling in prek - 4th grade then this is the game for you. BUT A FAIR WARNING!!! If your child or yourself get's too attached to this game (somehow) get ready to lose all your money because, its a game where you will get mad at having a stupid dragon and then spending 56.99 to buy 500 gems to get like 6 virtual dragons that last like 6 months.(not really)But its ok a little less than what i though it was.(a little pathetic overall) which makes it a below average game.Enjoy!",0
17366,Dota 2,2014.0,"I started off hating this game due to its massive learning curve, and quite frankly that is a good thing to hate about it, some people don't want to dedicate a lot time of to ONE game, that's understandable.I put 10-15hrs into it across a few weeks and then uninstalled it.A year later I jump back into the game and gave it an ACTUAL try.They added a tutorial, after I finished that; learning a few things along the way, I starting playing easy bot practices with a few easier heroes.The game's less complicated than it is on surface, once you get going certain things quickly become easier, however certain things take a long time to learn which is where its learning curve comes into play.That's where a lot of people (including myself at a point) are put off by this game, LoL is an easier alternative.But once you break past those first few (horrible, death filled) matches of you being confused as hell and making a ton of mistakes the game really starts to shine.You see the depth the game contains, the tactics.You start to get sucked in (if you're anything like me.)You start finding heroes that suit your tastes.THAT is where the game shines.Once you've put about 30hrs in you're probably bored of bot matches, so public matches here you come.This is where the game is the best, and also where it's the worst.The game can get very intense, if you're with the right people; a lot of teamwork will come into play.But (especially for a newbie) this is where the game is at it's worst.The community in this game is among the worst I've ever seen.You will be yelled at for making minor (or major) mistakes, for some reason they don't realise you're new, and they were to at some point.You have to start somewhere with Dota, so with all of the above in mind, do you want to start?",1
16700,Team Fortress 2,2018.0,"The simplicity of the game is what makes the game so fun and easy to learn but insanely difficult to master and I cannot tell you how much fun it is to learn how to play each class. When I first branced out into other classes for real was when MVM came out and I was practically forced to play other roles to support the team and at that point it's when I realized I had love for more than just the sniper and spy and I could learn to enjoy all the other classes too. There's always something of each class everybody can enjoy. (maybe not everybody)But why do I hate this game even though I gave it a good rating? The fact that this game is slowly dying and to me it seems like valve seems to care less and less about TF2 and just scrap up community maps for new updates and shove in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skins and try to squeeze as much money as they can. The last update wasn't terrible it had me playing for a couple more hours but it wasn't enough to bring me back to the good old days. Not only that but the prices of trading only increase and never seem to stabalize and constantly fluctuate which makes trading dead unless you have unsuals on you.But why bother leaving a good review you might ask? Because the only thing that TF2 seems to do right compared to every other game out there in the market, is that no matter how much I hate this game, get bored of it and realize how it's dying. Every month or so I will eventually come back to it anyway. The game is amazing and I can't deny it even if I wanted to. TL;DR  - I ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game but you should definetly still play it because I love it.12/10 would definetly get stabbed by a spy again",1
11121,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access Reviewtl;dr Robocraft was once a fun game, but it isn't anymoreI've played this game for a long time. I played it for a while before linking it to my Steam account, and some more since. For a long time, it was an awesome game with awesome features and a great overall concept. The dev team obviously cared about their players. At some point (within the last two years or so), that changed.Robocraft is now a bloated, unbalanced, pay-to-win mess. The devs spat in the faces of veteran players by removing many of the features that the players had relied on (tech tree and tiering system), and replacing them with confusing overhauls tailored to their new, microtransaction-driven paradigm.I attempted to live with the changes. I revamped my old robots to fit the new changes, but that didn't really change anything. The players who had been playing under the new system longer simply had the advantage of better-invested resources. I couldn't go back and invest the resources I had already spent on things that are useful now that weren't before. The changes put veteran players at a disadvantage have produced awful gameplay.I can't recommend this game. Even for free.",0

9520,Minion Masters,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewBetadwarf has put a great DCCG together. Totally worth getting in early access. This is actually a good game, it is fast and has responsive units with depth to them. It depends where you place, when you place, what you place. There are counters to everything. So, although in the beginning it feels like premium cards carry games on their own, you'll quickly discover weaknesses and ways to play around them. This depth creates great flux in the meta, a meta you can easily follow as all the decks are visible in the top score list. There are always different masters and different decks in the top, there is no oppressive meta or oppressive deck. It's easy to develop your own playstyle and add your own twist. On top of that it has different play modes that require different tactics, great replay mode, PvE content, 9 totally different heroes and some 120 cards already. Active player base, competitve scene, regular scheduled updates.  ",1

For those of you who havent played the previous said games, this will be a fun, quirky, 3rd person shooter, tower defence that can entertain you for hours. If you do not know, DD2 is a tower defence based on the fact that you must defend your base by using towers from 1 of 4 classes. Each class can place down a vastly differnt set of towers from each other, and so it is highly suggested that you play with other people of different classes (so sorry all of you fellow defenders who would play as the squire and solo every map). Other than placing towers, you are supposed to use your third person shooter skills, that you obviously aquired from Star Wars Battle Front 2, to shoot the enemies and help defend your base. Overall, the main point i want to portray is that DD2 is BALANCED. The towers of every class are really good and helpful (yes, the huntress's traps are REALLY good!), and each class has different attacks and abillities to make every class able to dish out decent damage without the use of towers.",1
2519,Brawlhalla,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewEarly impressions are wonderful. Custom games are even more enjoyable than the matchmaking. Ranked seems to be really tactical in 2v2s. Only thing I hope to see in the future are larger maps. Each Legend feels fairly balanced and can be counter with a few changed tactics. I highly suggest gathering friends up for nonsense. Hope to see Brawlball get it's own queue at some point, 3v3 Brawlball would be pretty amazing. Worth a download if you enjoy Smash Bros or Castle Crashers.",1

Put in hours on the mobile version and so happy it has finally come to PC to save my cell battery.Will take awhile for newcomers to come in and get there decks going compared to most who have been playing since the beginning. Get ready to grind. Besides that you will have a blast. Still has it's issue with online PVP with random disconnections and still wish it was set to old rules with 5 instead of 3 spaces.

1336,theHunter Classic,2014.0,"For a ""free"" game, this game sure had a lot to offer... if you actually paid for it. The environment was stunning, the A.I. was good from what I could see, the only problem is you have pretty much nothing to do if you don't pay for a membership. The only thing I could do in the free version was hunt one single species of deer, with one rifle, with no way of getting more content out of the game without paying.

I paid to play this game before the official release, things were alright as there weren't many bots arounds then. After the official release to F2P players, there were constant bot spamming in the main the city area selling in game money for real cash & the server lags badly as well. The developers are constantly shifting the goal post which isn't ethical to players like me who actually paid for the game. The official release was suppose to be somewhere around June but I assume they got greedy and rushed it, which has caused the game to have severe lag issues & bot related issues as well. If you wanna play this game, probably wait for a couple of months and come back, hopefully by then they've fixed the issues.",0

8165,Realm Grinder,2017.0,I love clicker games with an actual goal (other than non stop clicking). The tropies in game helps move that along and makes it feel like it's non-repetitive. Definitely one of my favorites!,1
676,Realm Grinder,2017.0,"It's a clicker/idle game.... but it's pretty addictive.There are a tonne of upgrades to unlock and each faction has it's own spin on them. Unfortunately, the game lacks any music - but rest assured, the soothing sound of frantic mouse clicks will keep you company. The background map is pretty basic and changes only occur when you unlock a new building or change faction. The menu/icons are fairly well done though and at the end of the day you're probably going to leave it idle 90% of the time to rack up money.Realm Grinder is a free game but tucked away inside are a bunch of micro-transations. These aren't forced or intrusive, so I'm fairly neutral on their existance. For the sake of transparency - the micro-transactions cover things like increasing click/building rate, puchasing rubies (increase production), converting your gems (increase percentage) without resetting your progress and  fast-forwarding the game.Overall, if you like clicker/idle games then you'll probably love this. If you're looking for something with a bit more depth or story, then look elsewhere. ",1

3518,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter wasting a lot of time (and money) in Hearthstone, and being disappointed with games like Faeria and Shadowverse, I wasn't sure what to expect of ""just another card game"". Although Eternal is still in Early Access, this game just blew my mind. It's a lot more complex than Curvestone, it shares a lot of features with MTG, and is developed by one of the most generours and knowledgable companies I've crossed paths with. I hope this game has a lot of sucess, because DWD deserve it.",1
2250,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewJust uninstalled.I must admit, a lot of it was part of personal preference, and it was kind of sad to do so. I want to like this game. The devs can do whatever they want, but that doesn't mean I have to like what they do. Some of the ""taste"" changes have been so bizarre and unjustifiable that the game is no longer fun.A lot of people reference the removal of tiers as the beginning of the end, but I didn't mind it so much. The game wanted to change, and it was a change I was personally fine with. For me, the game ended with Epic Loot. For those who don't know, it essentially turned the typical currency-reward system into RNG loot drops at the end of each match. While I admit that it allowed the devs to remove premium items and made them obtainable by F2P peeps, it also destroyed the most important part of the game.Thanks to Epic Loot, you can forget about building what you want.I kept returning to this game over the years and have no idea why. With RNG loot, I can't build anything I want. I have half of a cosmetic mask thanks to Epic Loot, but I also have no good plane parts or heli parts. You name it, I don't have it. Everyone should at least be able to make a respectable bot in the form that they want, and everyone used to be able to do it.But now, you can't. This game is Robocraft without the craft.It gets worse. For some reason, the game devs have some sort of thing for removing gameplay. Maybe I can't find the classic elimination game mode or the protonium crystal battle arena because I'm asian, although the more likely explanation is that they got removed and replaced. There have been many other changes, such as the removal of megabots, that I can kind of understand. Some things need to be fixed, and if they need removal, so be it. Unfortunately, they haven't been replaced with anything remotely interesting, just like pretty much everything in this game over the years.This game took away the building, and it took away core gameplay over the years. In the future, this cycle will only continue and the devs have no idea when, where, or how to stop. This game is dead in my eyes. Bye.",0

1805,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewJust going to throw this out there first off, some reviews are actually corret. After reading about a page or two of reviews I decided to try it regardless, thinking it might be a knock-off battlefield 1942.. and it kind of is in some sense. It was fun at first until you reach rank 3 and then it all changes. It turns into a completely Pay 2 Win game. You do not stand a chance if you do not own tanks / planes (Pilots & tank crew men) along with anti-tank / vehicle weapons. Maybe it was just me trying to stay loyal and play with only my US troop when Germany is clearly stacked and gets a lot more benefits in the war such as two spawning points, more lives, and their guns seem slightly better in general.All in all I give this game a 2/5.It has / had a lot of potential but as most F2P FPS games it falls on P2W in the end.. or really in the near start.

12184,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewSo I bought the american sniper recently. I bought it ONLY for the scope I'd checked out for a while. I have never purchased anything in a Free to Play game before.. This is the only time I have ever spent money on something like this, and of coarse I get screwed over... In the most recent update, they decided to take that scope away from me. You now have to buy the ''recon'' class to be able to use the scope, which I've already owned by giving them REAL money. You could/can buy that very same rifle for a much more reasonble price/grind. I am now stuck with a rifle that costed me alot more than it would have if I'd purchased it today.. (Scopeless)This so called ''recon'' class costs 20€. I am not buying something i've already owned.I am very disappointed with how the developers skrewed me over like this. They sell something to you, takes it away, repackage it in a different form, then sells it again for a much higher price... The greed is strong with this one.

It's also something good to keep a very young child entertained for a few minutes before they get bored once they use up all the gold/money and then find themselves with nothing to do.

16659,H1Z1,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAt the first time there were tickets that should give you an access to play Battle Royale, this obviously didn't make any money for developers, so they decided to split a 20€ Early Access game to two 20€ games (now you actually have to pay 40€ to get ""both"" of their games in Early Access. They promised that the game is going to be F2P at some point, but instead of that, they decided to make even bigger moneygrab. Once I thought that Early Access games are here because the devs want to get feedback from the community, to make a better game, to track bugs and so on. But that's obviously not true anymore.

The amount of rods, reels, tackle etc is already a lot and ever increasing with almost each patch.  The future plans for the game is also exciting.  As for realism - The fish seem to fight like they do irl.  You can feel the different fighting styles and strengths of different fish species.  You can't simply cast any bait anywhere at any time and catch something, you will need to have some understanding of where the species you are looking for will feed, at what times and what bait they go for.  There are also a lot of places you can travel to catch the fish you desire and this is also increasing after almost every patch.One of the top things about this game is the service they offer to players, which other games lack.  The devs listen to players when we feel something should be added etc.  Yesterday I had an in-game issue, I emailed the support and was helped withing 2 hours.All in all, for a free to play game you really can't ask for more - Tight lines! :) ",1

13943,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2014.0,"I probably had the less fun playing this game than any other racing game to date. I booted up the game and ended up waiting about 7 hours for the confirmation email to come so that I could activate my account and actually log into the game. This is the reason for my 8 hours of play time while I left the game minimized while waiting for the email to come. I was finally able to log in and was bombarded with the cluster-**** of a menu. There didn't seem to me to be any sort of rhyme or reason to how the menu was set up and the not-so-large amount of content was masked behind a seemingly endless menu, which was all locked behind a paywall anyway. Once I got into what seemed to be the only track available to me, in what seemed to be the only car available to me, it took me a while to get used to not using a racing line in a game. After ten laps or so I was finally able to race around the track decently quick but was conitinuing to be annoyed by the way the game played. The physics seemed decent enough, but as far as being any fun.. it felt completely stale and uninteresting to me. The only track available for free didn't appeal to me at all and I didn't care too much for the car either. I was using a controller to race and the game still just felt really rigid, stiff and so unexciting that after a couple more laps I decided that I was done with it. The final product just felt to me.. well.. free. They put a lot of focus on making the game seem quite real. The game definitely has a unique feel to it that you notice all the way through, but I wasn't going to give any of it a chance when the racing itself just left me bored.It kinda feels like a free version of Gran Turismo.

Sometimes it takes up to 10+ tries for the game to show up the servers (huge waste of time and patience - over 6h wasted in this + server queues). Its a known issue, the publisher does NOTHING to fix it.Instability - huge fps drops, even crashes by using marketplace, despite i have edited certain settings manually from the game ini files. HUGE amounts of server lagThe product is not as advertised - lack of endgame content (battleground/arenas), issues that were promised to be fixed from previous editions such as optimization/gameplay are in a HORRIBLE state. No endgame other than two dungeon.

11189,Creativerse,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAn impressive Minecraft copy with nice visuals and good optimazed framerate. This game is a lot like a game that is known for all of us ""Minecraft"". You could say this is a graphically improved MC with new features, pretty much a ""mod"".Not only it looks nice, it is also Free To Play and has no hidden costs.Being F2P, the developers recently released a PRO package giving some extras to those who pay 19,99€. The PRO package will give a double stamina, a glider, custom maps, increased inventory and some other things (you can read it on the store page). This is bad in a way as this will divide the gamers making this a little bit more Pay 2 Win. However, dispite this game being completly free, I don't really see a huge issue behind this DLC. You can think it as if you would be buying a game. If 20€ is too much right now then wait for the sales, as I would recommend or go ahead and support the devs by buying the new DLC, it is up to you.Skipping the previous, this game is worth checking out.",1
14761,EverQuest II,2012.0,"In the sake of full disclosure Everquest the original was a game that is and will always be in my heart for the experience, the memories, the great fun, the wonderful community and for getting me past some very bad very terrible times in my life.  With that said, and me having gone deep into EQ2 I thought it time to write a proper review of MY take on the game good, bad, and the so so.I found that the game still holds up well with the graphics and the music and zone immersion that can be tricky for any mmo or guge single player rpg to capture correctly.  The game has done a much better job recently of helping showing in the starting zones what skills and combat and crafting and gathering types of game play that is in and wanted by any fan of the mmo game.The amount of races and classes in this game are incrediable.  Over 25 classes (only 1 or 2 need to be baught in the in game cash shop) and 21 races (2 of which are again in the cash shop that need to be baught to be available).  An let's address that quickly.  Yes some of the best things are in the cash shop, 2 races and 2 classes, and the best housing (no monly in game cost of gold or solver aka ""rent"") and some other conveinces things like armor skins and very cool mounts.  HOWEVER, free to play players can have a fun, very vast, open world of experience that can easily be over 100 to 200 hours of content if the player wants to simply level to cap and see 10 years worth of zones, dungeons, quests and raids.  Now I went sub, ( I choose to pay monthly to play) as free to play players can not use some chat options and some other limiations I did not want.  However, again I stress a free to play player can come in treat this game (dungeons and raids aside) like Skyrim and have over 150 to 200 hours of free content to see and experience.An while the style of game is dated after 10 years and the combat again very classic Everquest or World of Warcraft, for some of us that is a plus and not a minus.  I do want to stress this point out for modern mmo fans that if you are looking for a world less static and more ""alive"" like Guild Wars2 or Rift, or anything else coming our recently this may not be the mmo for you.For people wanting to play alone, you have (in my eyes) some of the best voice acting that still holds up on most quest s, (75% voice acted), great great immersive zones and music, and a very strong personal and world story to experience.  You can hire mercenaries to aid you in your quest or dungeons, and can always over level a dungeon and do it later to both see it and solo.  Since this game has been out 10 years there are hundreds of zones, dungeons, areas, lands, public (non instance) dungeon zones and private (instance) dungeons to experience.The only bad or dissapointing aspects of the game to me, other then the game being 10 years old at this point is the dated UI (there are add ons to fix) and the quest mapping and tracking can take awhile to get into and understamd.  Definately advise you find a good community, active player base since I think (I do not know for sure) their are only several hundred thousand to a million players off an on.  However, no zone felt empty and i saw people in every zone and most eager to help or talk to new players.Overall, while this was not Everquest to me, it is a game i look forward to spending a year or two in off and on to see everything i missed, and to enjoy the next chapter of the Everquest saga before the next chapter in Everquest starts.  To any fan of old school mmo's or single players wanting a vast world to explore you could do far far worse then spend some time in this vast wonderful world.",1
1972,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThe new update has ruined key aspects of the game i was starting to love. I will no longer be playing this game. The main reason for this is they have removed crates. I would have bought the season pass in a second but the way they have made the premiere items in this game only achievable by grinding is not fun to me. The lack of skins and there creativity is also disappointing. Highly suggest spending you time and money elsewhere.,0

15974,Digimon Masters Online,2017.0,"The game is good but when you reach level 60 you have to go through level, not because of the difficulty of the game but due to the use of macro/bot that does not let you attack the monsters, you have to kill a certain monster and when he Will be born the player who is using third party programs kills the monster before it is born completely, then people say report to GM, but nothing is done, if you go on youtube you will see several videos where macro/bot occurs and complaints that GMs Do nothing is annoying it.",0
17473,Crush Crush,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewHere we see a local idle date sim. Out for money and maybe chums. If you loook for M rated content your out of luck. At most this game is mostly pg-13 (mostly wording and show of skin). If this wasn't or a meme related gag reel either (pay attion to the charates and what thay say, it's really cringey.) I would have maybe enjoyed it better.The progression sytem is nice, but it's pay for more progress style is actullaly really annoying. Considering you can get 1 gem for each level of relationship per first time also per ""person"" getting the gems per relationship level is good(one time thing for all girls also fallow the ladder.). Also about gift prices. The dev says the pricing of the gifs are resonable because it's spose to be un realistic...but c'mon really? It shouldn't be insanity just buy something for an early charater.I gave up on web based version, so I went to steam version. Nice to see it's a little more updated, but reallly not that much. All and all this is a desprate money grab from people who really don't want to wait for nothing. I understand it might be ""it's only to pay bills and certain dev costs."" I call nonsense.After 50 hrs. : Why am I still playing this? No clue. It isn't at all adictive. Haven't spent anything on the game. Spent my earned free dimonds on speed upgrades. x16 then reset presige at 51.6 this does nothing after you get to 40 in hobies. Not willing to pay into something that I don't need to pay into, so i'll gladly let this idle in my docs while I do other things.After recent update it seems a little less worse with leveling hobbies, but still seems like something is still going on that I can't figure out. theres really nothing bringing me back to chck up on my progress other than trying to play catch up with steam achievements. Which seem pretty pointless. Heres some pros and cons if your still reading this:+ Good Art+ Free stuff+ Not made to pay for an achivement(if this changes i'm done tottaly)+ Good UI+ Self explanitory+ Reseting count+ Can disiquish it's self from other idles+/- No real reason to pay into this?- Rather pain staking begining- Very cliche charaters- Pay wall behind some end game charaters- Reseting is like any other idle game on the market- It's idle and I hardly play idles becuase there is no ""Real Game Play.""- If your reseting some times even 10 or more points in presige points doesn't matter in reducing time gor skills or jobs all that much.- No real reason to play this for hours to get the achivements.- Last time I calculated what you would have to pay in order to max everying was around $800 Usd. yeah no...",0

Aside from the commonly-criticised excessive grinding aspect, and the luck/p2w of the cards you get, it's slow as hell because of the old ""Every action you take pauses the game for 3 seconds"" mechanic that all Magic videogames have.

The game is fun to watch for sure, I dont think I'll ever get tired of all the animations and quirky voicelines involved.Cons:Holy hell where do I begin?  This game is in drastic need of the ""Phase"" system used in every popular and successful TCG.  Without it it's impossible to properly balance and some decks will always be superior to others because of that.  There is such a crushing disadvantage associated with going first in this game, to the extent that I've surrendered games within the first few turns.  You not only have 1 less critical evolution when going first, but you also have to wait 1 extra turn before you can evolve. As a result it's overwhelmingly easier to shift momentum in 2nd than it is to hold onto it in 1st.  Other TCGs have adiquite balance (like card advantage) to counterbalance first turn momentum, this game strives to remove first turn momentum completely and as such removes any sort of potential advantage the first turn has.Final Verdict:I'm gonna stick to MTG and Force of Will...",0

One of the features I most appreciate is that I can play it on my Tablet PC or iPhone. However I must say my hat goes off to anyone who has mastered playing this on their phone.I also appreciate the fact that the developers have made this available for free and that you can easily play, win and progress without paying $$$ to play. Since I don't believe anything should be free and we enjoy playing this so much, I have happily spent my hard earned cash in the game which enables you to enjoy more tanks and faster experience.I'm sure many die-hard WOT fans will consider this trivial in comparison to the full game but for those of us who like to pop-in and out for a quick distration now and then it's a perfect format.We enjoy playing this game so much we started our own Clan MAYHM; look us up when your in the game and feel free to appy for membership, we will be dissmissing many members with preference towards players from STEAM.Look me up - MetalMayhemMasterHappy hunting!!!",1
15404,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewFor those who want to know a little more before getting this game, here is a basic overview of what is going on:-The game is a 5v5 conquest style, the objective is to control key strategic areas in order to gain access to the enemys base and ultimatly capture it-Strategys are very important, there are two left and right side wings where you must work up to the enemy side in order to capture a key jump base to get to the enemy base, this plays very well as they are effictevly two seperate maps.-In order to get between the maps you must ""jump"" to them, it takes one jump to return to base and two to cross to the other side (ignoring the middle gamma for now), this is very similar to games such as league, where there is effictevly a time gap one can use to make pushes but also allows quick defense, depending on what the other team is doing.-On each side of these two wings are resources you can capture to help buff your team (like a leveling system) - hence control on these is also important-Behind these two wings are the bases on each side, which also act as basically seperate maps-Finally there is a middle map, that every few minutes will open up. Capturing this gives your team a strong buff. Battles for these are often heated and are a great way of turning a losing fight around or making the final strike to win a battle. If your team controls one of the enemy's base jump points you can also jump directly to the enemy base.The Ships-You play with massive space ships (this is simply the coolest thing ever)-There are three manufactures, each with thier own designs letting you pick/choose your prefered ships-Each ship has a role, the basic three being defense, support and attack (With many permutations, but for simplisity these are the main three)-At the begining of a match you can choose your ship and as well talk with your team on your prefered ship and find a suitable team composition-The ships play very well, I find many enjoyable and balancedOverall I am very impressed with what the devs have put together. I personally enjoy balanced competitive games where there is little luck or ""dice rolling"" involved and that victory is because you have played better than the other team. So far the community has been great as well, which is fantastic.Final comments, the game is free and probably the best space game I have played in a while. Just awesome.",1

Exploring these options is part of the fun.And it all comes as a Free to Play game, but I have to admit the (completely optional) microtransactions, like more stash space, can give you a slight edge.But then again if one sinks countless hours into the game, one could argue that buying some microtransactions to support the Devs is a fair thing to do.All in all - awsome game. 11/10Update 2018: Still f*in great.

13884,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"As things stand on day one of this update I cannot recommend this game.If I could get a refund on the money I've spent in the store I would do.I know I'm a late comer to the game so I got it for free but between my account and my son's I've spent ~£100 on this game.  To me that means this game was not free, I chose to support Valve by spending money in the store, I bought a stamp (was considering buying more) and I spent money in the community market.My number one gripe is the locked first person camera mode while you are dead, this causes me motion sickness - this is a showstopper for me.Number two gripe, the insane waiting time to get into a match.  Does it help much to know there are over 800 players near by that are ""compatible"" and over 3500 empty servers?  No, that's just enfuriating.Choosing all core game modes to theoretically maximise my ""compatibility"" still resulted in a 30 minute wait time.  I ended up in a game mode I have never played which meant a map I didn't know so (even if you discount the motion sickness) I had a really poor game experience.  I know which game types I like (CTF and occasionally Payload) so I had a 66% chance of a crappy game.Compatibility?  Damn game sounds like a dating app.Number three gripe, I can no longer just sit and play on one server for a few hours with a bunch of people who ""just want to play"".  I agree that can end up with some pretty poor teams but even they were better than having a 50% chance of ending up in a game type I don't want to play and being force to play it or be penalised with a ""leaver"" debuff.Even if the wait times were down to sub three minutes I still want to be able to choose my game type, I like CTF, I want to play CTF.   I want to sit on a server and play until I'm bored, get voted off or get hungry / tired and leave.I can see how the casual / matching / leaver debuff system could enhance teamwork, not in itself a bad idea but as it stands I just want to load TF2, find a CTF server and play for as long as I feel like playing (and not be made to feel sick).This review is posted on day one of a major overhaul of the lobby and as such the wait times could be inordinately long due to heavens knows what.",0

9264,GUNS UP!,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewStart of the game all is fun then you hit 1k power with is nothing. At that point you start to see some weird stuff in the attack window. A 2 white skulls that has 1400 power and the 3 white skulls or the 1 red skull difficulty only has 900 base power. also alot of players down grade there power or something to face lowbies that dont have the units they have. In the end i lost the point of the game, its just a grind.",0
4205,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2015.0,"As a huge fan of LOTR and JRRT's world in general, I was looking forward to playing this game as soon as it was announced. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get it installed for a very, very long time until Steam came over to Russia. Now I had my chance to play and form my opinion. I really liked the graphics - much better than I expected. The mapping of the world is nicely done, lots of great and beautiful locations, and an interesting storyline too. At first, that is. Unfortunately, it all gets rather dull as you have to perform tons of similar quests to get that XP and get stuff without paying money for it. Because, truth be told, all this game does (like any ""free"" online game) is try and squeeze money out of you. You can play without it, but it's much more difficult and in the end it gets plain boring because you can't level up fast enough to keep up with the main quest, so you're stuck will all the small quests all over the place. It also takes you plenty of time to go places, from location to location, from quest to quest. There are lots of servers, and I played on Landroval which has plenty of players. However, it's still difficult to find people for team quests as they're so busy running around with their own quests. In the end it gets rather annoying when you just need to find one item and you're killed right in the tomb's hallway or something. The thing I loved were the holidays, all the challenges were fun and rewards worthy. And the good spirit of competition, too! All in all, I would recommend this game, though it's individual whether you keep playing or get bored at some point. I know I'm not the most patient person - with Lineage II I quit at lvl 69, and here the maximum is a 100... I surely do have better things to do with my life;)))",1
1776,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewGame has been somewhat fun but the mana / flood problems make you feel like one out of every 5 games is just down to pure luck and some games are just non-playable due to a huge RNG due to:Deck size is too large 75 cards + the mandatory 25 power cards = wild card swingsThe mulligans are stupid crazy...... your 1st hand can be 1 power = automatic mulligan into 2 power cards followed by the next 5 cards of no power cards thus = automatic lossMaybe if they fixed the power cards / mulligan it would feel like more strategy but a lot of my wins / losses are just feeling like one person got mana screwed while the other did not.So rare to have a good close game it's just silly to think it's strategy at this point. ,0
4505,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewEven though the game is still in aplha state of development,it is stable and very fun to play.There arent a lot of players but i am sure there will be more.I recommend it to everyone.It's worth a shot.",1
1370,Crush Crush,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewDEFINETLY the most moist game I've played this year.I could perhaps best equate this game to a bowl of TOP RAMEN®. Like ramen, it's a game that requires a certain mindset to enjoy, a mindset which consists of coming to grips with your place in life and understanding that, while partaking in this may devalue you as a person, you are still going to do it as a means of cheap personal gratification. It is also like ramen in the moistness aspects, a lot of animu grills do not contain what I consider to be ""just the right amount"" of moistness, much like how few bowls of ramen rarely deliver on moistness, but this game  and  TOP RAMEN® deliver the moistness on both counts.In terms of issues not inherent with the analogy, I must say that I can't get microtransactions to work. I managed to do it once by complete accident and have no idea what caused this.Overall it's like, if you ask me, is Crush Crush a good game, I would probably say yes.",1
13326,Freestyle 2: Street Basketball,2016.0,"Every year, as soon as the cold weather sets in, my hands become dry and flaky. With flu and cold season in full swing, I turn to excess hand washing, which always strips the moisture from my skin. To slough off dead skin cells and restore moisture, I make a batch of exfoliating sea salt hand scrub and keep it by my kitchen sink to enjoy all winter long.Though it's perfectly acceptable to keep this scrub to yourself, it also makes a great gift to give around the holidays. It's remarkably easy to throw together, so as long as you have all (three) of the ingredients on hand, you can whip up a quick batch. It's a thoughtful, customizable alternative to store-bought gifts, and ensures you'll never show up empty-handed to a party or dinner again.What You NeedSupplies1 cup coarse sea salt1/2 cup liquid coconut oil5 to 7 drops grapefruit essential oilEquipmentDry measuring cups10-ounce glass container (I used a Weck canning jar)ForkInstructionsGrab your supplies. You'll need 1 cup coarse sea salt, 1/2 cup liquid coconut oil, 5 to 7 drops of grapefruit essential oil, and a 10-ounce glass container.Add the salt. Pour 1 cup of salt into the empty glass container.Add the oil. Pour 1/2 cup of coconut oil over the salt.Add essential oil. Add 5 to 7 drops of grapefruit essential oil to mixture.Stir the mixture. Stir all ingredients until well combined.Seal and gift. Seal the jar and affix a label or gift tag to the top.Recipe NotesUse scrub sparingly — about once or twice a week — by spooning a small amount into your hands, gently rubbing it in, rinsing it off with warm water, and drying your hands thoroughly.I tried (and failed) to wrap both ribbon and twine around this jar. (It was so slippery!) To save your sanity, just affix a label, tag, or bow to the top of the jar.",0
1371,World of Warships,,"used to play this quite alot, back when the game was only available via their own game client. After they made the right move to release the game on Steam, they then went on to literally kill the concept again, by only allowing Steam-connected accounts, which means you are now not able to log into your World Of Warships -account, and will therefore need to start on a fresh. Apparently, they don't value their loyal players, so i've now quit. It's a shame, as the game was actually well made, but i really don't see the point in starting over and accept the slam to my face.",0
1199,SMITE®,2015.0,"I have been playing Smite since it launched back in beta a few years ago and before it launched on Steam. I still love it and in fact I play it more than DOTA 2, League of Legends, and Heroes of the Storm.  I just love the aspect and controls of this game more I love the idea of playing gods and how some of their kits are imagines and worked into the game.  No complaining about auto pathing here as you are in control of your character at all time unless your under some hard crowd control effects like: Being in the moth of Fenrir, Being Slapped by Poseidon's Kraken, or Being stunned by Artemis' Boar the list goes on.  I just really enjoy the game and what it's become it’s the most Action based moba I can think of without a top down camera. There is also Awesomenauts but that’s like a moba/ 2d platformer which is neat in its own right.If other Moba's have not piqued your interest with their top down perspective and possible micro managing. Smite throws all that out the window for a fast paced and third person perspective!Do I recommend SMITE? Yes. Just the fact you can earn premium cash (gems) in events and for logging in daily says a lot most games that are free to play don't let you earn the premium cash. Paladins does as well with daily log-ins but they are both Hi-Rez games.Give it a shot! Play gods most of which You probably never heard of Like the Mayan Pantheon. I never knew about a Chaac or a Xbalanque guy!? But more of what I like is how they made these gods their own unique characters! Seriously just try it it's free.",1
18205,Neverwinter,2014.0,"I'd say it's one of the better free to play games out there, but with that being said, there are some faults with it. Since it is a F2P MMO, there is obviosly going to be a microtransactions store. However, I wouldn't exactly say that it is pay to win.With the aiming and casting mechanics, early game is fast paced and fun. The only problem I have with this game is the end-game. After reaching the max level, everything becomes a daily quest. You log in, do the quests, claim your reward, maybe replay your favorite dungeons, and then get off. It becomes tedious and boring after a while.If you're looking for a casual MMO to get into where you don't have to farm for hours on end, give this game a try.",1
2425,Minion Masters,2018.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewMinion Masters takes the standard pages from your average mobile game. Loot boxes, daily quests, monthly events, the standards. Even though it's still Beta its clear the Devs put a lot of work into it. A lessor developer would have published the current build as finished which does speak well of how clean it looks. Easy interface, simple to learn system, tutorial, a good selection of cards and a decent rooster of possible champions to choose from. (Once you pay in game currency to unlock them that is.) That's not to say it's perfect. There are still glitches and improvements that are needed. You're most common glitch is probably just the quests not being marked when they're completed or the game not being able to register achievements even though Steam marks them down. I've probably gotten dozen of them or so and the bloody ""Unlock 3 achievements"" quest still won't register them. C'est la vie. The game tries it's best to offer lots of different ways to play and experience the game, but it does get repetitive as everything, despite the mode you play pretty much boils down to the same thing over and over again. I guess some people find this fun, but I need a breather from this type of insanity after a short while. Still there is promise of future game modes that may drastically mix things up so I guess that's a good thing, if it follows through that is.Although I'm pretty sure the game is not pay-to-win, there are a number of obvious 'tricks' that are being used to get you to open your wallet. There's a feature in the game called the Battle Pass and this to me... felt like a huge insult to players who don't want to spend more money. You see, like all games like this, they have like ""PVP seasons"" where players can earn ""points"", called Glory in this game, to climb up Tiers and earn extra prizes. Nothing wrong with that. The Tier system is split into two branches, one free and one for those who buy the Battle Pass. (With in-game or real word currency) Again, there is nothing wrong with this. It's normal to offer bonuses to those who are giving you money. Why this bugs me is because the free branch has many, MANY, empty tiers. Hours of game-play to rank up will earn you no reward sometimes for multiple tiers of the pass and earning a rank up can take hours of game-play with ranks needing tens of thousands of points. For a new player you're looking at about 20 points per victory only unless you use the Wild Cards provided to you which rotate out, then about 1000. So a rank up can take about 50-60 matches and without the 400 point Wild Cards, this would be impossible. I'm not crying for rewards equal to those who paid extra, but nothing? Really? Once I realized I was essentially ""spinning my wheels"" I really lost a lot of motivation to play. So yeah, there are a few practices that I don't feel comfortable with. They're not evil choices, like EA, but they are defiantly amoral. Still the game isn't unplayable and does offer a bit of fun. Even if it's not my cup of tea and despite the fact that it feels somewhat unrewarding unless you're willing to shell out extra cash I can see many other people enjoying it. Honestly, I really liked the Commentator. Reminded me a bit of Blood Sport and Rock n' Roll Racing.It still kind of sucks. The fact that I know I'm going to be be static for the next 50 wins, not matchs, playing the same cards over and over again because I litterally have no way to progress outside of pounding my head against the wall pretty much leaves you feeling hopeless and depressed. Maybe there are people who like that. Hmm, pay-to-have-fun. Yeah, that's what this is. I'll leave it a positive reveiw, because there are some people who like this type of game and Minions Masters does deliver it. Can't account for taste I guess.",1

2561,theHunter Classic,2016.0,"Hey guys, just to summarize, I love this game, but the AI Collision Avoidance/Pathfinding needs to be fixed. PLZ READjust thought I'd say hi and get some important things out of the way for those that are looking to get this game. For those wanting to get theHunter, know this; it is a Hunting SIMULATOR. This is NOT like Cabela's Big Game Hunter where you can just stroll up to a deer and shoot it point blank in the face without it spooking. YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME AS IF YOU WERE HUNTING IRL, which is why I recommend to AT LEAST learn the basics of hunting before even starting this game if you have NO hunting experience whatsoever. If you choose to ignore me, you'll find the game boring and give it a crappy rating, just like what all of the other inexperienced players have already done, hence why the rating is very poor. Other than that, for anyone with hunting experience, such as myself and a few other friends, we can say as a whole that theHunter is very entertaining to play for someone with hunting experience. My only complaint with the game is the Collision Avoidance and Pathfinding for the animal AI, including Scent Hounds and Retrievers. The thing is: there practically isn't any collision avoidance or pathfinding. For example, I've had several times of where I've been tracking/chasing a game animal, only to find it stuck in a bunch of trees, simply because its AI had no collision avoidance/pathfinding programmed into the code to dodge the issue. Same thing for the Scent Hounds/Retrievers: I've had moments of where I'll be walking through the forest or up a hill, and my Scent Hound will get stuck in a bunch of trees or on a rock, simply because its AI had no collision avoidance/pathfinding programmed into the code.",1

I recommend and you should try, if you don't like it, just uninstall.",1
1707,Path of Exile,2014.0,"I've spent hours upon hours playing Diablo 3. I love that game too. This game is pretty awesome in it's own right, but while they come from a similar mold, the two games are as different as night and day. I think both are good, personally, but what makes this game really amazing, is the outstanding value. This game gives everything you would expect from a triple A developer. Literally. Just gives it to you. Nothing that is sold in the stores is in any way going to help you win the game, unlock content that is needed, or give you a special edge in the game. It's a full on retail value game, literally, for free. Play it all you like. Make up to 24 characters. Have a huge shared stash by default. I'm going to end up supporting this game eventually when I get the money. Not because I have to, but because I want to. This game makes you WANT to pay for it, because it's freaking awesome. If this hasn't gotten you interested, I don't know what else will, but if you're a fan of Diablo, Torchlight, or the genre in general, you should give this a whirl without a doubt.",1
2790,War Thunder,2018.0,"A very fun game but the grind is rediculous, ive been playing since the first day of ground forces and quite francly have given up ever getting to modern vehicles which is the only thing that tempts me to play the game. The modern tanks are all over the trailers but dont kid your self unless you are prepared to spend hundreds of pounds you will never reach them. So no i cant recomend this game not untill a massive reduction in grind time.Its a chame tho becasue the game is sound and fun and all the developers would have to do is too make an effort to reduce tyhe grind in a big way which could be as simple as the removal of silver lions or a massive and i mean massive reduction in research and lions costs. I know the entire community agrees with me on this so i dont see why the devs arent smart enough too see that their game will die without it. I mean just reed the recent reviews FFS. All that needs to happen is some major changes to the grind and it they will gain the loyalty of the player base back and start getting the great reviews they got a few years ago again.Until then tho its a game not worth anyones time.",0

6812,War Thunder,2018.0,"I may as well rewrite this review now that I'm in a better mood than I was when I wrote the original.If you're looking for a game that is something of a halfway point between World of Tanks and a more serious simulator style game, then War Thunder is very much for you. The damage models are quite in-depth, being the kind of thing I've only really seen outside of WT in proper simulator type games such as Arma 3 meaning it is important what kind of shell you use beyond the base stats on the card such as penetration.A word of warning though, this is a game I feel guilty recommending due to the devs being... Let's just say they have made some questionable choices when it comes to this game, but I still can't bring myself to stop playing it. Is it because I've put hundreds of dollars into this game in the time I've spent playing it? Probably, to a degree. But is the game fun? Absolutely, especially if you can play with friends and as a result raise your chances of winning by about 50%.If steam reviews had an option for 'There is some good balanced out with some bad' or some other kind of neutral review, I'd go for that, but for now I'm going with not recommending it due if for no other reason than because this game has become almost like quicksand for me, where the more I fight against it the harder it becomes to try and break free.Original Review: Don't get into this game, it's like trying crack.At first it's fun, seems fairly harmless and doesn't effect you otherwise.Then it gets expensive, both in time and money, especially if you want to upgrade anything in Tier V/VI.The game itself is gorgeous, and has a lot of potential, but the greedy devs behind it only want to add more vehicles to an already poorly balanced game on top of nickel and diming the playerbase only to be rewarded with god-awful events.I'll probably still play it, but for Christ's sake don't get into this game or you'll end up like me and any number of other poor saps who have sunk too much time into the game to drop it.",0

And unlike both of those games it's actually possible to gain a real collection without spending a fortune.  I've thrown $20 at Eternal so far, but it by no means feels necessary to get a complete collection.

This game is the spiritual successor to RO so if you didn't like RO you won't like this.PROS: Amazing artstyle, it's absolutely gorgeous.Good ol' card system from ROCombat is fluid and satisfying with great effects and good sounds.Amazing soundtrack, one of the best I've heard.Loads of variety in enemies and boss encounters are hard and satisfying.This is a game for the hardcore RO fans and it also includes some unforgiving hardcore mechanics such as weapons can break if you fail an upgrade and there aren't many ways to regen HP and SP in combat except for potions. It's not a game for the casual MMO gamer even though it looks that way.CONS:No open world pvpHeavily instanced even though the zones are large, it still makes the game feel disconnected at times.Combat at early levels (especially with archer) is just going around in circles, it get's way better later into the game.Story is MEH even though the setting is great. (Based on lithuanian folklore).FOR THE RO PLAYERS:This games grind is very much like RO, there are 600 levels and reaching level 600 is probably going to take a few hundred hours, if you liked the grind in RO you will like the grind in this game.TL;DR A game for those who liked RO and hardcore korean MMOs, I doubt this game will have a huge playerbase but the playerbase it will have will be very dedicated and probably mostly from RO.",1

15415,Magic Duels,2016.0,"Magic Duels is the most cost effective way to play Magic in a way that feels like the real game. There are a number of negative reviews and, while there are some valid concerns (the game interface is no Hearthstone...the animations slow the game down way too much - even the card playing ones -, and there are a number of cards and game modes you simply cannot play that you could with MTGO or the actual cards), the good FAR FAR outweighs the bad. Advantages as follows:1) The game is absolutely free to play and is not riddled with advertisements. While you do not start with amazing cards and people who pay will get better cards much sooner, earning cards is much more efficient than Hearthstone and feels, to me at least, to be worth the grind. I have not paid a cent for the game (though I may in the future) and probably have close to half of all the cards you can get from all 5 expansions, including many powerful mythic rares and planeswalkers. Yes, my ""hours played"" is closing in on 300, but it should be noted that I have left the game on many times, including overnight multiple times that has artificially inflated that time when I haven't been playing. You could get all the cards I have with significantly less play time.  Even if you choose to buy cards out of the gate, this game will NEVER approach the costs of real Magic (which can be cost prohibitive if you really want to play with the best/most powerful cards)2) The deck building is real! Unlike all prior duels games except 2015, you can make your own decks as you want. This was what really held the old duels games behind real magic in my mind. I didn't care as much about different game modes, but I wanted to make my own decks and try my own combinations. You can do that in duels and it keeps getting better, more nuanced and more interesting with each release.3) Great way to learn magic. This has been talked about before, but introducing new people to Magic via Duels is the best way for them to learn, as the game can really hold your hand if you want it to. 4) All the great things about Magic remain true. Best CCG there is...beautiful art...fun interactions. Just a great game.I wish that there could be more interaction with online opponents and that the game could be a bit faster, but overall, there is no other way to feel like you are playing real deal Magic for as low a cost. Love it!",1
15730,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is my first Steam review and it's for a great game! If you're looking for a game to scratch that Magic itch before Arena comes out, look no further! Developed by some top MTG pros (LSV, Chapin) and it definitely shows. Coming from Magic I love the combat and the Power/Influence system. There are things in this game that couldn't be done with a paper card game, like persistent effects in the void (graveyard), buffing cards in your deck before drawing them, and stealing units end up in your void. There are less opportunites to respond to actions than Magic, but more than HS and it keeps games moving quickly. It is definitely the most F2P CCG out there, the game practically throws packs and gold at you if you keep up with quests and events. They often have events in game that you break even in terms of gold/value without putting up a stellar performance. I've spent 25$ on this game but it's only been for cosmetic items, I don't even need to spend the gems (real $$ currency) because I have more than enough gold and shiftstone (crafting currency) to do what I want to do. At the time of this review there are 3 sets out and 2 campaigns which is already a pretty good card pool with more on the horizon. The development team of Direwolf Digital are great with their interaction with the community.The initial tutorial is a bit long, but they give you a nice stash of gold and base cards to start with. There are two AI modes that give pretty good rewards. One is a Forge, a draft-lite experience, you pick one of three card options and then are presented with 3 more cards, and so on until you have a deck. You keep all cards from Draft and Forge, no phantom drafts here! The other AI format is Gauntlet, where you play a deck of your choice through a Gauntlet of AI decks, with one loss ending the run. At the end of the run you fight a Boss deck that has a specific ""gimmick"" that may benefit or hurt both players (i.e. both players start with 3 power, when you play a unit play a random weapon on it, etc.) Whenever I get burned out playing PVP I like to reset with a Gauntlet or Forge run.",1
9598,Dota 2,2014.0,"A maelstrom of anger, fear, disillusionment and sheer ecstasy - Dota 2 is all these things and more. You’ll learn to hate your friends and love random strangers during the forty five minutes of an average match. In that short span of time, grudges will be born, heroes will rise and poor plays will be vilified like a G R R Martin epic. And yet for all its emotional drama, both highs and lows, you’ll still yearn for more. Just learning to play is an adventure into masochism. Everyone begins as a dreaded n00b, unable to contribute anything but gold and XP to the opposing team. A few weeks later and they’ll have learned a few tricks: where to place wards, how to turn off auto attack in the options and, crucially, the ability to take abuse on the chin without rage quitting. Give it a few months and they’ll be rolling with the regulars. Double stacking, recrowing and GGWP will become part of their vernacular. Immunity to the insults will be delivered upon their chins which have since grown thick with stubble and caloused skin. They'll have succesfully joined an inclusive club whose members include the heroes of the world's burgeoning e-sports scene. Consider the football metaphor, pub matches are like a kick about down the local park using the same boots, strips and footballs Rooney, Messi and Neymar use in packed stadiums full of shouting people.      If all of the above sounds a bit much then ask yourself: What’s the point of playing if you don’t feel something in the end?  Dota 2 delivers passion and fury in spades, and like all great games its hidden depths forever tease like sirens upon the rocks, always ready to punish an overblown sense of ego. Just don’t look at the item store; your partner/parents/common sense will never understand why you spent $35 on some virtual eye candy for your favourite hero…",1

17139,Creativerse,2017.0,"I love this game and how it works. I do wish it had a creative mode so that I could build things and produce my own blueprints. I like that the blueprint system allows me to substitute in blocks of my choice. For example, the Small Tradtional House blueprint uses yellow wood walls. I hate yellow, and was easily able to go into the advanced pattern options to substitute blue wood walls instead. Pro is worth it. I get hours of enjoyment from this game and being able to glide helps me explore the map without making too easy like true flight. The flashlight is JUST enough to help out, but for deep diving in the corruption and lava layers, you still need other light sources. Again, it doesn't make it TOO easy, but helps and is worth it. The technology in the game definitely keeps me more interested in it that Minecraft. The only complaint I have, is that I wish it had a creative mode and I could make my own blueprints and an offline mode. I spent money in this game before which is why I believe I received Pro for free, but I'd honestly buy it if I didn't have it.",1

That alone should persuade you to get this game",1
18600,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI very STRONGY advise you to stay away from Paladins. You will understand why by reading this review.I'll start with the pros, to give you an idea of why i chose to play this game (non-steam client) for more than a thousand hours. I've started a bit before Mal Damba was released, and seen a quantity of the many aspects this game took.Pros+ The game, at it's core, is fun. Visual feedback is great, and certain champions are incredibly fun to play (Mal Damba! But also kinessa, lian, etc.)+ Lively game (for the moment!) so matchmaking often takes almost no time.+ Currently no pay 2 win mechanics+ Great art direction especially on the environment. Coherent and really readable visuals (I insist on its readability. It really ticks, unlike a certain game it is rather... inspired from). Some really great character designs (but some others being terrible in equal measure).+ Grohk the blue orc.Cons- Clearly one of the worst game balances I've ever seen. A few top tier champions are always picked, so much that a good third of the champion cast are never present. As I am writing this review the game is in OB67, and ranked matches are grounds for only the same faces all the time: Makoa/Moji/Talus permaban in almost all ranks, and every match having Seris, Inara, Zhin, Tyra, Ash, Fernando, BK, Lian, Lex and Jenos. Casuals are even worse since there are no bans and the triad of doom is always taken, ending up in very frustrating, imbalanced matches.- Generally very bad design decisions. The game is constantly fighting against itself and every countermeasure introduced to fix a problem becomes another, bigger problem by itself. Healers are too strong? Buff Cauterize (healing reduction on hit item, buyable in-match) to 90% at a cheap lvl3. 90% yes, and it is the same for Resilience (CC reduction) which is one of the cheapest items in the game. Bam, almost full invulnerability to cc's, giving cc-reliant champions a very hard time even surviving, and dumbing down lategame to a brainless shootfest without strategy.Combine very small maps with low respawn times and mounts, and you have a game that is very hostile to flanking and doesn't leave breathing room if you pull off multiple kills by yourself as a damage/flanker, also adding to the frustration because whenever you flank you have a very high chance of being suddenly ambushed by a newly respawned opponent without having enough time to react to their sudden apparition, gotta watch these respawn timers closely :^). How did they ""fix"" this? By making flankers unbearably strong against their supposed targets, and thus extremely difficult to balance (one single fix can make a champion useless, cf Skye, or completely broken, cf Talus.)Patch after patch, they also continually lowered the skill floor for champions by enlarging the size and raising the speed of projectiles by absurd amounts (what would have been a typical quake 3 rocket launcher speed on evie's staff for instance, has simply become an instant-hit from a reasonable distance. This has been the case for all projectile-based champions).They also introduced auto-aim skills on certain characters, lowering the skill requirements even further. While I don't mind accessibility, constant decisions like these make the game especially frustrating, as many shots are simply unavoidable (moji flames, bk royal subjects explosions, zhin/maeve/evie/ash/willo shots, drogoz spitspam,...) without using skills that grant iframes (which not everyone has) even between the hands of novice or very bad players.All this leads to a meta where the only thing that really works is a 2tanks team with a very strong healer with great survivability (seris/jenos), an unkillable flank (talus/zhin) and a tank wrecker (tyra/bk). No room for creativity, or you get utterly destroyed simply because the opponent had a better composition.Paladins also inherits from the bad aspects MOBAs have, as in, if you perform badly, your whole team will suffer. And the chances to lose just because of one single player not doing their job are immense. This, also, is very frustrating (and actually the reason why I am rewriting this review: Just went out of a losing streak of 6 matches, in which I performed unusually well, but lost because of another mute, illiterate player ego-picking a damage champion (thus forcing a teammate to play something they are bad at), and then flanking alone to evidently die.)- HiRez has a history of constantly disrespecting their playerbase if not even showing contempt to them, by not listening to player feedback, introducing pay2win mechanics destroying the whole game (infamous OB64 patch from which, hopefully, they backpedaled. Dig the controversy around this patch if you want a good laugh, or to facepalm yourself through the ground), exploiting early access state to excuse an unstable client, game-breaking bugs and performance issues, which they left as-is up until now. If you need more evidence look at what happened with Tribes: Ascend, Global Agenda and Smite.Paladins has been in Open Beta since around... 4 years now? Yes, 4 years of beta.- Easy Anti Cheat. This should be a huge red flag. Their client also installs two almost useless but mandatory bloatware services on your machine (hipatchservice). If you are concerned about privacy, be prepared for a proctology exam.- As much as I hate using this term there is no other way around this time: the community is insanely toxic (LoL/Dota2/csgo levels of cancer). Diamond players are the worst offenders in general. In parallel, a ♥♥♥♥♥on of ragequitters (even in ranked, doing this on purpose to ruin their comrades' ladder climbing) and cheaters (teleporting payload, mounting mid-fight with infinite CDs, aimbotting, wallhacking, you name it).Reports don't seem to work also, and the penalty for leaving a match is a joke.- Insanely bad matchmaking. In ranked you'll often see silver/gold players being matched up against diamonds, lots of people with ranks they are not supposed to have (diamonds playing like total newbies, and gold players that play superbly well). There are also rumors of matchmaking forcing players who paid for skins against much worse players, preferably free2play.From a gamedev standpoint, they have awesome artists, contributors and dev staff, whose work is being ruined by the greedy, unethical mentality and business practices applied by HiRez's higher ups.That's all I can think of right now. If you're still not convinced (you masochist :p), try it out by yourself since it is free. Just please do not give them your money, they do not deserve it as they are currently.",0

8862,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2018.0,"Since playing against the AI uses up Duel Orbs (and using 3 at a time gives the best reward) you'll run out of them quickly whereas PVP is free and so will be where you'll spend most of your time unless you're playing very casually. To have much hope you'll need to build your deck around a character's ability for example Chazz has an ability that lets you play Ojama Country even if you don't actually own it so building a Chazz deck around Ojamas and/or Armed Dragons. A strong multiplayer deck is one where every card in your deck helps the strategy in some way. In spite of a piece of advice saying there's no correct deck having Mirror Wall, Widespread Ruin, Metalmorph and possibly Enemy Controller or Riryoku are musts. Be warned that this is not the 5 spaces Yu-Gi-Oh!; it's speed dueling. Many people in multiplayer play as Kaiba and fill their decks with Blue Eyes and Hieratic related cards so multiplayer gets repetitive and a mode where you often have little chance and missions can hinder you having a good deck. With only 3 magic/trap and monster spaces, repetitive multiplayer and limited singleplayer against the same opponents over and over I give this a thumbs down but if you have time to spare go ahead and play a bit here and there.",0

1455,Infestation: The New Z,2016.0,"I played this Emulator of Infestation/WarZ before they had plans of releasing it on Steam and take my word on this....This Emulator is how Infestation should be played. My Buddy and I slay kids on this game and have loads of fun doing it. But while this Emulator is amazing it isn't perfect. Some history about this game you should know, the creator Fredaikis use to be an ISS hacker himself who got banned and decided to make his own emulator and anti-cheat with it. The Irony in it all is the original developers of ISS who banned him initially praised him for his work and made NewZ officially licensed by their company. That's where I kind of cringe when I play this game at times...Pros:- Skins, older skins can be purchased with GD (Game Dollars) eventually.- Is far from P2W- Loads of AR's, Snipers, and just looting in general just feels rewarding always and isn't a grind.- Custom Characters- Loads of Maps, including modifications to the older ones.- Little to no hackers at all (Maybe came accross 1 or 2 during my near 1000 hours of playing this emulator)- The Developers actually listen and care about the community, I say this because they shot themselves in the foot when they wiped snipers out of everyones GI little over a year ago and lost a large amount of their fan base including myself and decided to bring them back after asking the community.Cons:- Still uses the same crappy engine, so optimization isn't in anyones favor.- Still haven't fixed the aim bug where bullets will randomly shoot elsewhere.- The spawns are terrible if you're out to jump into high pop PvP. Campos especially, people litterally spawn on top of each other and at that point its a matter of who's going to lose their spawn shield first and lose their sh*t.- 4 man clans, an issue that has ruined this games PvP since I began playing. trying to do small PvP and having these clans of 4, 5, 6, even 8 roll in mowing the place down isn't fun.Overall amazing emulator highly recommend this version of Infestation to anyone that's into PvPing.",1

3128,PlanetSide 2,2017.0,"It is quite hard to decide on this one, I think you should at least try it, thinking that it is a free game, and there is nothing quite like it.BUT, the way the game is set up, allows only one tactic to succeed. And that is bringing more soldiers into the battlefield. Zergs own everything, simply put. Bases are basically arenas and do not favor any side.When the continent populations are similar between factions, they generally end up fighting in bases that are in the middle of the continent at a neverending stalemate meat grinders.The game is full of frustrating things, but every now and then you will see something spectacular that will make you think it was all worth it.",1
2461,Dungeon Defenders II,2017.0,Early Access ReviewMy boyfriend and I both downloaded the game after playing the 1st one on the 360. For him the game won't even open. hes redownloaded it and the game just never opens. For me I can get into the game but once I click one of the options on the main screen they never load no matter how long I let it sit. All in all I'm very disappointed. Hopefully this is just a glitch that will be fixed soon.,0
11403,Creativerse,2018.0,"This game was the reason that I first created my Steam account, after seeing friends play it, and wanting to play with them. The game plays well, and even with the horrible specs of my computer, I can run it on max graphic settings the majority of the time. It's a ton of fun, even if all you're doing is sprint-jumping in a straight line back-and-forth across the world in order to get rid of the clouds on the map.",1
14835,Dungeon Defenders II,2017.0,"Currently 7 Hours on the Game; Planning on playing more!So far I'm addicted to the game, I'm a big fan of these type of games and this one takes the cake. Not the type of game that you would ""need"" to spend money on because the Campaign itself is very rewarding and satisfying when you comeplete an area/stage. Currently we have 4 character slots to swap in/out in the game, which caught my attention and at first seeing as this was unusual it is quite necessary as each wave adds higher difficulty to where teamwork coordination and knowledge of characters go into play. One complaint is there should be some type of kick/report feature in-game to remove ""trolls"" even though this has only happened once where a teamate would disregard us and let us win the stage for him. Maybe this has been implemented to the game and I'm just blind but I think these two would definitely help smooth out in-game issues. Other than that I have had a great time playing and was a good game to get my mind off things.",1
334,War Thunder,2018.0,The game was once playable at best but has devolved into an unplayable mess. Tanks are too broken to even comment on so lets stick to air game. In which unless you are in Russian or german planes you are nothing more then fodder because those sides will always get to start in the air and win based upon that. Game had great potential but the Devs have 0 interest in balanceing anything unless it benifits russians.,0
20340,Fishing Planet,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewGame was a lot of fun, economy was♥♥♥♥♥♥but game was still fun.

4373,Fallout Shelter,2018.0,"Great game, fun and interesting, for the first 20 hours, after that, you will find yourself repeating all you do and waiting for things to happen (things take actual time, say 1h, close the game and 1 hour later it's done), over and over. Veeeery repetitive in the end, BUT, since it's free and it grants a descent amount of fun time, I'd recomend it",1
12095,Crush Crush,2018.0,"I find this to be a shame, because I found this game to be enjoyable, until I found it it's pay to win. Your progress gets extremely slow and you will need to reset your game several times in order to get even a slight speed boost, but even then I do not think it's possible to win within a human lifespan without spending money. Microtransitions should be to enhance a game or to make it faster/easier, not make it POSSIBLE to win. The fact that it's free to play but you have no choice but to pay to win is irritating and misleading.They should've just cut the microtransitions and gave this game an actual price, or made it possible (not even easy, but possible) for people who want to try to beat it without spending $20+ on it.",0
8979,Star Trek Online,2018.0,"This game is definately worth playing if you are a fan of the Star Trek Universe. The graphics are a little choppy and outdated, even on maximum settings it is not the greatest BUT it is also by no means the worst and you will quickly adjust to it and even forget about it due to the immersive and interesting nature of the Universe and the plotlines unless, of course, you are one of those people that cannot find joy in a game unless it is using the most recent graphic technology. The storylines are interesting, there are a myriad of options and a great deal of depth to the game when it comes to improving your ship, outfitting it with new equipment, training your officers, dispatching them on missions and so forth. The customisation for your ship and captain/officer uniforms are expansive and very detailled. Most of them do not require Zen to purchase.There is a LOT of complaining regarding this game when it comes to the lockboxes and Zen purchases. It is worth saying that there is absolutely NO need to purchase ANYTHING in order to experience and enjoy this game to the full unless you are an impatient person who objects to having to put some EFFORT in to the game in order to reap the best rewards. So, if you want to get the best things quickly and zerg your way through everything without having to actually work for it like some over priveliged snowflake then be prepared to pony up some cash or have your self indulgent whine about it and go play something else that better fulfills your need for instant gratification. However, if you appreciate rewards gained for time and effort leading to an actual feeling of ACHIEVEMENT when you finally get that top tier ship you always wanted then you won't have any problems with this game. In any case, you will be given a new ship of a type of your choosing every 10 levels and most things available via Zen can actually be purchased via the Exchange (Star Trek's version of the Auction House). There is NO NEED at any point EVER to open the many, many lockboxes you will be given or pick up during your gameplay unless you want to.** I did have one issue with Crytic when I first started up that is worth a special note! ** Basically their website refused to accept my card details when I tried to subscribe and so after two attempts I ended up subbing via Paypal. Now, the two attempts in which I tried to use my card actually resulted in Cryptic putting two ""hold"" transactions on my bank account for Â£1 each. Not a lot of money and not a problem for me financially, but it was unauthorised and without my being notified in any way, thus I had a huge problem with it! I contacted their customer support via email and received a response within 2hrs in which I was informed that this is standard procedure and their way of checking that the card details are, in fact, valid. They stated the money would be returned to me in 10 WORKING days, and it was. In fact it was never actually taken from my account. I confirmed with my bank directly that this was the case as I actually tried to reclaim the money at first thinking this was some sort of scam and they informed me they could not reverse the transactions as unauthorised until the money had actually been withdrawn by Cryptic, however the funds reappeared at the end of the 10 working day time frame. So, if this happens to you just bear in mind that despite the fact there is NOTHING on their subscription pages informing you this will happen, it will likely happen unless you have made a purchase with them before so don't panic like I did! They really should make it clear to customers that this is the case though as I was VERY angry when I noticed the two unauthorised transactions on my account and had my bank waiting to open a fraud case against Cryptic as they never informed me of this and I did not consent to it at any point. Use paypal. Trust me.",1
19587,H1Z1,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is a LOT better then H1Z1 just survive.Its playable.Fun with friends.car are fun to drive :Pbut it lacks some major features..Limited weapons..No weapons customization.. (scope's , larger mags , silancer etc)you can jump out of cars at full speed.. without any major disadvange..I personally hate the weapons ballistics but most people are ok with it.The dev's sometimes do not fix the thing causing bugs and issues. instead they save time and effort by removing the thing causing the bug in the 1st place. eg: there was a bug with doors using which you could go to the roof of buildings from top floor(not all roofs have access through stairs.).. they fixed it by removing all doors from the top floor (atleast in the Z1 map, Not sure about the new ARENA map)Iam giving it a positive review since its Fun to play with friends.Games are played to have FUN!!",1

5627,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"I used to love this game wholeheartedly and it pains me immensely how Valve basically destroyed this game piece by piece.Playing PvP is frustrating as hell as the server decides to switch you to the other team during rounds! I have absolutely no problem with team balancing between rounds, but balancing between rounds completely demotivates me to give my it my all!The game mode that made me play a ton of TF2 was MvM. This is a really fun gamemode that reminds me a lot of Tower Defense games. But you don't place towers around the map, rather you as a team are the towers mowing down enemy waves. But this mode is unplayable! Trying to join servers via matchmaking is an impossible task as you will always be greeted by a prompt ""round is already running"". You either have the choice to re enter or leave the server. Re entering will only result in this prompt being displayed to you again and again! But hey, you can always use the server browser to join servers! No you really can't for MvM since majority of them don't allow you to join in any other way than via Valve's crappy matchmaking. I don't get how a game that ran so smooth and perfect can be made so broken in just a few messy updates! TF2 is not going to die off because its competitors are vastly superior but rather because Valve itself does a well good job of letting TF2 die.",0

19910,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIt's my favourite Digital CCG so far. Magic inspired mechanics, lots of combo potential and good Free to Play content.EDITSo, since MtG Arena is so close now, I tought I'd update this review to highlight better why I like this game a lot over magic.This game is pretty much what MtG would be if it was made for pc in the first place. You can send tokens to your graves, you can duplicate cards, you can permanently change stats of cards on the board but also in the grave, your hand or the deck. All kind of fun things that will never be possible in Magic.The other ""upside"" is that the gameplay is streamlined compared to Arena. If you saw the gameplay of Arena, you know the obnixious amount of times you have to press ""next"" if you attack while you have a instant in you hand. That's not a thing in Eternal. It removes some (just a few really) options from you but makes the game play much better.So, no, it's not Magic. It doesn't have the insane amount of cards. You can't cast instants between every single substep or you opponents turn. But it does play very smooth and have a lot of new tricks availlable to you. It's still my favourite card game and I encourage you to try it!",1

The new set made it P2W, it's absolutely awful design because the set is so powerful and renders everything else useless. It's just got strictly better stuff so if you can't pay you can't win. Maybe if they actually balance it I'll reccommend again, but they want money before it dies. They'll just get the money and the game will die, like so many other ccg's.",0

Utilizes (meh, again) CCG system for loadout and collection management: ""deck"", ""hand"", same ""Hearthstone"" rarities, boosters etc.Considered P2W by majority of players, for top-rarity units can only be countered by other top-rarity units, which is very frustrating for beginner players since getting those cards require either grind or money. Plus don't forget to buy Heroes if you want to compete.Your nexus is a stationary Hero, with its own auto-attack and 3 abilities, gained at lvl-ups, normally passive or triggered. XP is gained by controlling a bridge (your unit was the last one present on a bridge - means you control it). Other than that typical rail strategy tactics - this unit type counters that, that counters those, those counter nothing but consume time, etc. Everything is fine until you meet some legendary bs which counters everything except big wallet.There are 3 types of cards: Unit, Building(timed), Spell. Some building can auto-produce units too. Your loadout consists of Hero and 10 cards without duplicates. In match, cards are indefinitely rotating in your 4-card-hand as you play them, plus you can see which card comes next. As of right now, (before release), there is total of ~70 cards and 7 heroes.Map is a small oval halved by impassable line with 2 bridges - basically, its so small that tactics turn into a mess very fast. You can spawn units on your half of the map and some units are so fast that they can reach enemy nexus in just few seconds from there. Thus, matches are lightning fast. And even if tug-o-war prolongs, developers push it to the end manually - resource generation rate constantly increases. So after just couple minutes game already turns into ""smash all buttons really really fast"".Biggest R&D failure I found - alot of things allow you to spawn units on enemy territory (read: right on his face) which allows them to instantly hit nexus without giving a fk about anything else. This doesn't make game any more fun not even mentioning it ruins fundamental principles of rail RTS.Btw game is strictly multiplayer: there are like 10 AI ""Challenges"" but that is just your tutorial - extremely easy and done in no time (read above: lightning fast matches), after that - PVP duels only.Last but not least, game lacks a general style and fixed setting, as for me. Overall it looks like fantasy.. then there are space marines, drones and spaceships.. and then ALL OF A SUDDEN flying kawai rabbit head with huge anime eyes and cute ears. Like, wtf? It's technically Conflux but it feels like Clownery instead, for some reason.Few cosmetics are here too if you wish. Particularly, you can decorate your half of the map with arena skin, they look gut and cost gut.Kind of fun game for 1 evening, but I don't recommend spending any money unless you are fan of rail strategies and be like ""yeah, this is totally my game"".Class: III - BreadVerdict: No But YesReviewed: 12.17.2016Approach: Steam Beta - PCTime: An HourDeeds: 13 Level Wood 3 Rank All AI Challenges Complete 1 Legendary Card ",1
8654,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI have jumped in to capture the valuable mining structure for my team. I am the first one here, no allies to back me up, no enemies to contest the point. Good, because my hull is already down to less than 50%, and my targeting system had been damaged so my lasers won't hit anything anymore anyways. I begin capturing the structure. Halfway through the process, an enemy ship jumps in. Not a single scratch on it. I am doomed.I position myself behind the structure, the other ship has no clear line of fire. My only hope is to hide, conquer the point for my team and escape. The enemy is bringing the ship around and I suddenly can relate to the rebels on Yavin IV as they watch the diagram of the Deathstar moving into position to blow them into oblivion. The point is close to being conquered and I initiate the jump, hoping that I will stay long enough to finish capturing the point but not long enough to... get hit by the swarm of guided missiles that is now headed my way! The enemy has brought their ship fully around and I grind my teeth as I anticipate the deadly impact as-ZAPPI am back at motherbase. I must have missed the missiles by half a second.

The community itself: for people that just started the game without knowing anyone else playing this game it will be hard to do dungeons, because most of the high level players dont join your party due to your level.

Although you can spend money for better looking costumes, it also gives the F2P a fair chance of getting items that p2p can get too. It also gives you the option to choose a subclass which is amazing, it gives your additional kit lots of extras.Cons: You will do alot of auto-pathing, The community is not always that friendly/helpfull for new players.

Sadly, I may quit soon, because if I were to build a world that I want to build I will want to pay for every block availiable now and in the future.

18672,Dungeon Defenders II,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI will be writing this post from the point of view of a player that has never played Dungeon Defenders I.This game is pretty much Sanctum meets Diablo and Borderlands.It is a pretty looking FPS (first person shooter) set in a tower defense game. The game itself is mainly centered around loot. Getting weapons, armor and pets which upgrade your hero(es).Pros:•Pretty looking visuals.•Fun loot system (rarities, traits, certain map/mission bound loot).•Great co-op play with friends or random other players.Cons:•Lack of/bad difficulty scaling. It will be impossible to beat a difficulty higher than hard with a low level character as it does not scale with your level but instead is set to level 50.•Bugs. Lots and lots of bugs. For example: People joining private lobby sessions, loot being sent to bags which have autoloot disabled and many more.•No support for Borderless Windowed mode (alt tabbing is a pain and might get your cursor stuck).•“Early access” after two years of release. Feels like an excuse to not do/delay bugfixes.•Pricing of “DLC” and currency. While the game is free to play, I would consider paying 20 Euros for some stuff. However that would be able to get me a single character. In order to buy all “year 1” characters I would have to pay 60 Euros, the price of an AAA game title. As long as the prices stay this way I will not make a single purchase.•Currently unobtainable currency locks skills in certain stores.•Very slow free to play progression for additional heroes. Your first 10K medals costing hero can be bought in about a week due to campaign rewards. After that you will be getting like 300 medals a day for daily quests on average while heroes still cost 10K medals.•Goblin Siege Rollers.While this game has issues, lots of them, I will still be giving it a thumbs up because I simply enjoy the (free to play) gameplay, and that is the most important thing about a game.",1

19683,Magic Duels,2015.0,"This is a pretty poor attempt at a Magic game. It's pretty sad when you have inferior TCG's like Yugioh or Pokemon put out better products. Here is why Magic Duels sucks. 1) Next to no cards in the game. You would think that with a game like Magic that is 20 years old that a game about it would have tons of cards right? Wrong, this game only has about 500 something cards, and that's including the new Battle for Zendikar set. It would have not been hard for them to add in at least everything from M10 to M15 and some Duel Decks, but no, instead you get next to nothing. All is in the game is Magic Origins, Battle for Zendikar and a few random cards from random sets.2) Its very difficult to get new cards in the game. You only get 15-20 points if you beat someone online or the CPU and it takes 150 points to get a 6 card booster. What a joke, it takes winning 6-8 games to get 1 stupid booster pack that might be total trash. I dont get why boosters only come with 6 cards when in real life they have 15.3) No drafting. Drafting is one of the fundamental signature formats of Magic, yet it's not in the game. How is it that the new Yugioh game has drafting when Magic, a game that has had drafting as a format for over 10 years, doesnt have it in it's own game?4) Stupid deck restrictions. You can only play 4 copies of any common, 3 copes of any uncommon, 2 copies of any rare and 1 copy of a mythic rare in your deck. I dont get why they invented this rule since real Magic isn't anything like this and having this random restriction in the game makes no sense.5) Next to no content. All there is in the game is the crappy storyline, battle against the CPU and battle against people online. 6) Campaign is such a waste of time. All the matches are scripted and the storyline is pretty boring. The CGI is pretty cheesy and boring. This is a pretty sad excuse for a video game for a game with a ton of depth and strategy such as Magic. How it's competitors are doing better is pretty pathetic. I dont know what Wizards of the Coast was thinking with this game, but it sucks hard and I would not get it. Even if it's free, to have a decent deck that doesnt take you hundred years to get, you have to pay a decent amount of money. Stay away, stay very far away from this pile of garbage.",0

2395,War Thunder,2016.0,"Dont look at my steam hours on this game. i played not from steam. It took me a long time to get to this point . I am not that guy who goes just about to rage after he was killed.. This review is a sum up of my expierence with gaijin from the long past time. I joined them in 2013 december. Back then it was only planes and was fairly good. Had its bugs pros and cons but was good. All went to hell with the patch 1.24... and from that on it went only down.. Then came the ground forces. Man it was good. Again alot of bugs but it was good.. you would kill and get killed but it did not bother me. And after every patch it got worse in groundforces. And you could feel the bias towards russian forces. And now it just RussianThunder. Why? becouse russians dominate tier 5, dominate tier 4 ,dominate tier 3. Before the Br spread and change 6,7 was really playble BR. Well you guesed it. Down came the br nerf"" it is for the people , to get the tier 5 battles going "" oh yeah right... only nation benefited from these BR was russia. There tier 5 beats the hell out of anybody. So ""free frags for the t54 t10m and is4!!!! Russian shells have also  better mechanics then other nations. 122mm shells just go trough anything. why other nations shells obey the laws gravitu ant etc... Russian armor: oh man those t34 bounce a tiger II shell even from a 50m distance, whell you now they had like 9999+ armor values... but somehow there 85mm go like a knife trough butter,,.

10297,Fractured Space,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has everything that an epic team-based combat sim needs. It's set in deepspace so you can rest assured that there're stunning vistas, mighty warships and intense combat. The game mechanics are quite intuitive and need only a minute or two to get comfortable with; but it'll take a lot long for you to master them! The fact that the game is quite simple doesn't mean that it's dull or repetitive. Every bout is a new one and I thoroughly enjoy each and every session. So to summarize: +Massive Spaceships! (whats not to love?) +Intense combat+Intuitive gamelpay +Pretty background -Eagerly awaiting new maps -Debugging (Jump fails for example) -Could use more gamemodes (capture the spacestation? escort? something like that)I thoroughly recommend this game to all everyone with a love for sci-phi, combat sims and team-oriented gaming. 8/10",1
15967,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"Let me start this off by saying that I am not a fan of MMOFPS games, such as Battlefield or CoD. I personally have a dislike for them.That being said, I'm surprised how much I enjoy this. I wouldn't consider it the best FPS I've played, or hell even the best free to play game, but it does what it's meant to do rather splendidly.I am a sucker for both open world sandboxes and strategy games, as both types offer variety based on what you think to do in them. Combining both in this was a great idea. I can count numerous times I have changed to a Sniper, gone up to a cliff near an enemy base, and shot down enemies from a distance, or better yet turn to a heavy soldier and blast at tanks and vehicles.Now for the visuals. Oh boy, even if the game is 2 years old, I can easily say that this game is gorgeous, and for a multiplayer FPS, that's rather impressiveNow for the big question: does this game work as a free to play game? Thankfully, I say yes. At first, I found a system where you spend points to spawn vehicles. When I found it, I thought it was going to be one of those parts of the game where you have to do very hard things to get back points, or buy them with real money. However, my fears were debunked when I found that the points gradually regenerate during play, meaning they don't easily run out. Thankfully, I have not yet found any pay-to-win items in the game.If you are a fan of FPS games, or multiplayer shooters, I recommend giving this a go.",1
10855,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI have been playing this game since january and, looking at how the game has evolved I can really say that the effort put in this one was really well used and this game is really genuine. Its mixture of cute element, showing a game with stylish textures and  horror, with well conceived monsters and references from other games, like silent hill, resident evil and five night at freedy, has made me a fan of this game.As for the early access, I must say that the game plays just fine, but there still many bugs that I've noticed that annoyed considerably, especially those related with the music and sounds, with sometimes fails to play.

1201,Robocraft,2016.0,"They kept killing it by changing the core mechanics.They basically added paywalls to the point that progressing is really boring if you don't throw a lot of real money to it, to the point that the game currency is almost useless (the last time I played it they changed it to some sort of ""dust"" lmao) and swapped normal rewards for lootboxes...These crates give you 4 items (8 with premium) and you don't get money by even winning the match, you have to recycle the items for in-game currency, but is not satisfying either because it's like 10/100 of the price in the shop while a premium user already has x3 times more stuff than you by that timeAlso, only premium get the rare stuff from the rare crate (yeah, rare quality stuff appears). Too bad you didn't payed for the rigged ""random"" cheap rewards.Matchmaking is broken as hell, there's people with an endgame weapon attached to a low tier leg just to get on low elos so they can progress faster.You can get every weapon too quickly with money, it kills the point on dedication.Medics are useless, they heal too slow, dependant and can't really deal a lot of damage...Don't even make me talk about the megas, there was an extra final tier called ""TX"" where people had ""mega"" robots and stuff like that, they removed it completely.Just don't play it, don't give them money, they don't care about the community, the in-game currency and the matchmaking.

7751,Heroes & Generals,,"so where do I begin, I played this game wayyy back before this game was even ""released"" onto steam. When I played, it still had a Beta tag at the top right corner. Ahh the memories, anyone remember that? The Beta tag I mean? Reason why I bring this up is because, the game was actually GOOD when it was still in beta. Gave the game some sort of a excuse for slight mistakes. But now that it has been released, that excuse doesn't work anymore. The game was a lot more fun and simple before Squad 2.0 and everything after that. I quit the game maybe a year after the release of Squad 2.0 because of the lack of new content. Because of how long I have played the game, I felt the urge to come back to see if any thing had been added or changed. To my surprise...................... very little changed. Tanks are now much harder to kill, which I have conflicting feelings about cause I loved playing my tanker. And 1 map was added. ONE........ COME ON RETO!!!! I played a few matches on that new map (in regular MM, too lazy to even play War anymore), ended up carrying the team as per usual and then I once again, unistall. A few weeks later, the new update comes out and turns out, another new map was added! Cool! I check to see what it is, and turns out, it is one of the ones they leaked a former HnG streamer that I watch 2 years ago. WOW, I have no words anymore for this game. RETO, if you want to bring back former players and veterans while at the same time hooking in new players, PLEASE! Take a look at what made so many players come in and play mid 2016-17 and rework from there because at this rate, the game WILL die.TL;DR Game was good back in the past, never should have left Beta phase. New players beware, veterans/ returning veterans, either join me and watch the game we loved die or help tell RETO that what they are doing is wrong/ plz roll back to the pre Squad 2.0 era.PS: I have nothing against Squad 2.0, I thought it was a decent idea but I am using it as a point of referance if you will.Sincerely.

4202,Path of Exile,2015.0,"An excellent action RPG for all Diablo 2 fans out there. For me Diablo 3 was kind of a disappointment, long story short: the loot didn't feel exciting. In Path of Exile I actually expect to find useful items. I constantly find myself getting excited over a rare item dropping and even some basic white items for crafting.Another thing I disliked about Diablo 3 was the auction house, it just ruined the trading aspect for me since it completely removed any and all interaction with other people. Maybe I'm weird but I enjoy discussing prices with other people and actually doing the trading. Even with most people setting up a semi-automated shop via the use of ""Procurement"", you still get to interact with other people and there's bartering to be done.PoE has a microtransaction shop where you can buy cosmetic effects (armor skins, effects for your weapons, pets etc.) and stash tabs. You could argue the stash tabs affect the game in a way that could be interpreted as pay-to-win but I disagree. You can play the game just fine with the free 4 tabs you get by default, you just have to pay inventory tetris a bit more and choose what items you wish to keep more carefully. The skins you buy for your armor/weapons are also transferrable between items and characters, so you don't have to buy another one to apply the effect to another item.The skill tree and skill gem systems allow for a wide variety of builds and I find it nicely flexible to fit whatever I want out of a build at the time. It's more than just unlocking a fireball; you can divide that fireball to several fireballs each dealing a bit less damage but that way gaining more AoE, you can then add other types of damage to it or even make it a damage-over-time focused fireball instead of explosions, if you so wish.In conclusion I wholeheartedly recommend this game for anyone looking for a good ARPG experience. It starts out a bit slow but trust me, it's worth it and once you get into it, you won't be able to stop theorycrafting new builds to try.",1
16470,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game used to be really good and addicting, but the new update absolutely ruined the game. Unbalanced it, and took away the fun of actual design. No longer worth playing, uninstalled and never looking back.",0
16647,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"This game is by far the most unbalanced card game i have ever played. if you are looking for games with actual rules to make interesting gameplay mechanics happen, feel like you have achieved anything at all aside from opening 50 PACKS after the tutrial???? wtf?? sounds great right? wrong. this makes everyone have absurd cards and just remake accounts until they get what they want. uncommons can give you 5 mana for a 13/13.... uh.. if everything is that powerful, there's a huge slope in the game when you go against someone that just can't be thwarted. going first has such an aggressive push since the opponent can attack the player rather than the units and unlike hearthstone, all the big crazy units that everyone already owns makes it no fun at all. I will say the storyline idea was good and the attempt at a choose 2 of the 4 cards draft was interesting. but. the lack of balance makes this game by far crap..Try Eternal Card Game, Hearthstone, Magic the gathering, or something of the sort, because all of those games hold more hope than this game will in a long time.",0
586,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"I didn't know where to put this review. I've gone from Pokemon to MTG to Hearthstone to a brief stint in Duelyst to this, and I don't really think it's the strongest out there. Like Hearthstone, it's very snowball-ey. where aggro wins because they dictate trades. In a game like MTG, defenders control much more of the pace, which inherently allows slower decks to operate. The game also has a lot of pretty weird mechanics and busted cards, and while thats nice for a new player to know what the first card the should craft is, it's not really as fun as a diverse game. Similar to Patches in Hearthstone, it sucks the joy out of the game.However, despite all this, the ""gimmick"" of evolving guys is well done, and it feels more balanced than, say, the coin. Some mechanics are pretty solid, easy to learn, and reward both slow and fast decks. Ultimately, it's a good experience, but I like MTG and Hearthstone more than I do this game. If you don't have the budget for those games, though, this is a really F2P-friendly game that offers you so much reward if you put in the time, so for those players, this game is great. Tl;dr - good F2P and a good experience, but I prefer Hearthstone and MTG",1

11547,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"Overall, this game is fun for a while, but gets grindy like other card games**The only other TCG game I played is Shadowverse.Compared with shadowverse, the gameplay is slightly better with two lanes, prophecy, etc, but I feel this game is way more grindy then it. Bethesda really wants to spend money on this game through packs and expansion which puts F2P players at a disadvantage. I feel they can find other methods of making money such as cosmetics like the Shadowverse avatars. This game also limits the story for F2P players which I find highly annoying. At least Shadowverse does not do this. Its funny cuz Shadowverse gives out free packs during expansions instead of charging for it...If only there was a game that merged ESL gameplay with Shadowverses generosity... ",0
614,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,"First I time came across with TF2 was after I bought an Orange Box from the store, I was dying for HL2. Didn't know it was coming with this cartoon-like game called TF2, and interestingly I almost was going to ask Steam Support to remove this game from my game library after watching a clip on Youtube, seriously, I was like what the £€$$. But was too lazy for that. So time passes, looking to something new, I see this TF2 thingy again in my library, so whatever, let's download and give it a shot.Now, after a year, I wish I had submitted a ticket to Steam Support and got this thing removed from my account. Clocked 1000+ hours and I don't know where and how this will stop. There are two things you can't apparently clear, one is radioactive contamination the other one being addictive to TF2.Oh, and supposedly this game came free with Orange Box.

6600,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAs of 5/1/2017, this game is very well done. Reading through the negative reviews, it appears many of them came months ago (or even last year) before big changes were made to avoid being stuck without lands. I'll keep it short and sweet; I've played 5 different card games since childhood and have played them all hardcore; this game IS what magic online should've been. It plays exactly like magic, with a polished, contemporary Hearthstone-esque look and vibe. A TON of deck variety and way, way more meta than hearthstone or magic. Definitely give this game a try. The ONLY negative for me is the tutorial; way too long and they don't explain everything completely, such as differences in weapon types etc. Grind through the tutorial though, it's definitely worth it.",1

It being a MMORPG is what the game is ruined by in my opinion.

This is a very poor decision, a very poor price, and not worth the time of it. I get that they need to make money and I support them until they make some unforgivable decision, but this is pretty bad. It really sucks to have bouight a pass over a year ago that still hasn't had any benifits for the added cost then be told I have to give more to enjoy more of the game. If she were say $5 or you can buy her with diamonds that we already have bought, it would be more fair or even give people incentive to save for her then make it kinda an investment that woulf pay itself off.Also a side note, my outfits and pinups that I unlocked over a year ago that I lost and contacted support over a year ago still have not be restored and is still a common issue you can see in the user forums.

15827,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFun game until they make changes.  Awful management.  Simply awful.1)  You create based on what you've tested and played thus far, then they pull the rug out from under your creation by making significant game-swaying changes seemingly without having done much testing/balancing of their own.  Any fun you have putting energy/thought/creativity/TIME into your robot is suddenly turned into twice as much frustration because they change the rules of the world/game upon which you based your creation.2)  Team ""matching"" is entirely random or non-existent.  Rare is the match where the teams are even.  One game you dominate and feel like king of the world only to be slapped senseless in your next match.  How about checking some numbers before throwing together two teams?3)  Pretty sure they have no idea what to do with mega-robots.  All these cool huge scale robot late-game items that you figure out after-the-fact can't be used like the robots you played with up to that point.

410,Paladins®,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI see that the most common method of reviewing this game is by comparing it to Overwatch.I have not played Overwatch so let me review the game based on itself:I love the art direction with the cartoony characters and the super fast pace at which the game takes place. The combat is fast and fluid and by keeping the powers to a minimum, it's easy to pick up and learn. I did not even need to go watch the tutorials. A single round in-game and I knew how to play. As a free to play game, not once have I felt pressured into buying anything. This is not pay to win and it is not pay to win faster.Things I dislike... I guess there are 2 issues for me at time of writing. It seems like most players struggle to shake the Deathmatch instincts and are too scared to take risks and play the objectives. This is an objective-based game. The mission always comes first.My second issue is that the servers seem to be having a hard time keeping up wih all the players that joined since the steam launch. Finding issues where I can't login or the game gets stuck on authenticating. But Hi-Rez always sorts it out pretty fast, indicating that they do indeed care about this game.Overall, I would rate it a solid 9/10 just because, in the end, this game is built around the core of FUN!",1
536,Infestation: The New Z,2016.0,"MP: ★☆☆☆☆COOP: ★★☆☆☆This game never changes. It get's re-released over and over again, but everything stays the same.

2189,PlanetSide 2,2014.0,"I don't usually write reveiws for games, but felt I had to with Planetside 2. I'm not particularily good at the game, nor do I have an outfit (clan) to play with, (which I hear improves the enjoyment of the game), however I've gotten tons of hours of enjoyment from this game nonetheless. The largest things that causes me to keep this game in high regard are:1) The ability to feel like you're contributing reagardless of how skilled you are. Of course, if you are very skilled and have a large squad to coordinate with, you'll have a large impact, however even alone and even if you aren't getting kills, healing others, repairing vehicles, spotting enemy's from afar, giving ammo, contributing to mass advances, etc. all help your teammates and don't require a large amount of skill.2) The incredible amount of customization and unlocks. The amount of things to unlock and advancement is so immense that you will always have something to strive for and gives a constant sense of purpose and achievement.3) The amazing feel of mass warfare. Large zerg swarms of infantry followed by huge player tank conveys and large air battles raging overhead is just extremely fun, and just being there as part of it all, on foot, in a vehicle, or in air, is just plain awesome and very few (if any!!) games offer this experience on this scale.4) It's completely free! I've paid about only $5 for a little bit of station cash, and the only reason I paid that was to support the game. You can easily get by without paying a dime, and I did until I felt like a criminal getting so much enjoyment without paying anything. There have been complaints of pay-to-win and tediousness if you don't pay, and while there is some of this, I don't think it's completely valid. But, judge for yourself, as it's completely free!!! There's so much value and so little cost (as in $0) that it's a no brainer to at least try the game out!!! ",1

9383,War Thunder,2017.0,"I want to love this game, I really do. Tank sims are my jam, and this one is a lot of fun from that perspective.However, it is extremely unbalanced in favor of the Allies, particularly from battle-rating 4.7 to about 7.0 (a very significant proportion of the German tree). Mid-war German tanks will frequently be facing late and even post-war vehicles from the Allies, thus negating any of the perks that German tanks historically had. Matches are often frustrating because you will be facing enemies that you can't possibly hope to defeat given the limitations of the game itself and the fact that most players are utterly clueless about teamwork (though that doesn't come as a surprise in today's online gaming environment).Another huge problem is spawn camping. There's basically nothing that stops players from sitting near their enemy's respawn area and shooting people as soon as they spawn in.Hopefully Gaijin will seek to balance the game more in the future, but somehow I doubt it. I recommend this game if you enjoy tank/flight simulators in the World War 2/Early Cold War era, but prepare to be extremely frustrated by the Battle-Rating system and spawncamping.",0

7109,Brawlhalla,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewBrawlhalla; An online Steam version of Smash Brothers, if you will. Like plenty of other all-out multiplayer fighting games, your outlook on this game really depends on your outlook of fighting games in general; If you're a competitive player, you'll probably be a nuisance and complain about the slightest flaws in the games, characters or level design and get turned off my minor issues like that. If you play for fun, however, you'd enjoy the multiplayer experience alongside the fact that it is able to be played with a controller, so no keyboard troubles for you (that is, if you have the USB corb & controller)! The characters are notably memorable from the gnarly ""overpowered"" Gnash to the hustling ""surprisingly female"" Hattori. Each have their own different weapon choices, which makes for different scenarios and unique battles, so long as you don't annoyingly and unnecessarily complain about their ""being overpowered"" or flaws, as that's personal and others can totally prove you wrong. As of now, new characters are being added to the shop, alongside the prior DLC in the forms of Valkris, (as you spell it in-game) weapon skins and costume skins. Each one is unique, and if you got some spare money or would care to costume up some of your personal favorite Brawlhalla characters, go for it! A few bucks would be worth it on a unique look. The recently-new level system made it so that you could obtain gold, skin colors and prior stances for each character. The only problem with the leveling system can get quite tedious a certain of levels in, it's still worth it for some prior stances, skin colors and gold for future characters. They have a ranking system and just a 'for fun' online free-for-all option. The ranking system goes from bronze and progresses a few gems up, and just try not to get frustrated as if you lose, you're likely to get deranked depending on your rank. One notable advantage from Brawlhalla opposed to Smash Brothers is the lack of long updates required to go online and the relative ease of being able to connect online and join a room with friends, not to mention it's quite easy to drop out and spectate. Although Brawlhalla is still being updated and some of the stages are either opinionatedly bland, trippy, or just ""frustrating"", Brawlhalla is an amazing Steam versioned substitute for Smash Brothers, and although it isn't quite as good, it is definitely worth the $13 purchase. Keep in mind that this is my personal opinion and outlook of the game, so if you have your own, feel free to let me know! 9/10; A Clauds recommended online Smash Brothers :]",1
6547,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2015.0,I've only done the assembly and dissassemly of the AK-47 but I'm impressed with the graphics and animations it makes a very nice educational tool to learn how these guns work.  It's also surprisingly detailed it just needs links to gun suppliers to show where you can get your spare parts from. I'm unsure of it being a game concept.

Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive.

You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger.

9052,Creativerse,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThe game is Fantastic there are so much layers of mines so much to explore and so much that no one has learned for the game like how do spawn rates work or how do chunks work.I reccomend trying it yourself!,1
5687,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,Sad kinda game. Very grindy. Seems like pay to win a lot to me. Waiting to get into battles is about 2 minutes. Not counting the queues untill finding a game. Good graphics on th eplus side. In the end a MEH kinda game.,0
8292,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI was recommended this game by a friend that really enjoys a number of similar games, and I have been loving it every since I first tried it.  There are some cool mechanics that I think can only really be done in electronic card games (or at the very least would be a pain to manage in paper games) and there isn't really any randomness unlike what I have experienced with other games.  Though you can purchase cards with real money, I have never felt the need to as the reward system is extremely generous (you earn a free pack for your first win daily, there are lots of ""objectives"" that will give you a pack or two upon completion, etc).  Lastly, it was quick to learn.  The introductory campaign covered a lot and there is a solid single-player ""puzzles"" section that allows you to understand the ins and outs of different mechanics.Overall, I highly recommend this game!  I enjoy it every time I play, and it was really easy to get into with no starting experience.",1
4413,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"CCG games which its mechanic are mostly the same with Hearthstone, eventhought its still ages juz around for 1 year, Cygames generosity, plus the fact that the game is f2p, there is no reason not to try it~",1

592,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewA 3/5 game for sure. Pros:+ WWII shooter + F2P + The scale of the war and the fact that it is entirely dynamic+ Having a good game in this game leaves you feeling especially satisfiedCons:- Shooting and movement feels extremely clunky (see drunk Niko and Roman)- The sound of the guns is ehhhh- Massive amounts of grinding required to get anything - Interface could be betterIn short, if you like WWII games and have some spare time, you might find this game an amusing distraction.",1
10219,Robocraft,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewI seriously love this game and with the new patch nobody can say, that this game is ""pay to win"" (it wasn't even before). I spend lots of time with this game and I am now in tier 7. I haven't paid any money yet but I am considering because the game brought me lots of joy. It is not only about the PvP part but also about the building part, trying to make the best out of your bot. There are 4 different classes of weapons which make it quiet interesting. In the first two tiers it can sometimes be a little frustrating, especially if you don't have a good design but that should only make you wanna build a better one ;)For everybody who like PvP this is a must-try and for everybody who wants to find the engineer inside himself, it is too :)",1
15260,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is the CCG that I like the most. It has blocking and fast spells to enable reacting to something your opponent does, which is good i think. Its also not too hard to build a collection and looks quite nice.",1

13888,Magic Duels,2015.0,"The game is unplayable. When in a match, the ""targeting"" keeps jumping all over the place, so I can't use cards at all. I have tried unplaugging my controllers and my keyboard, but the highlight still jumps all over the place. I'd try unplugging my mouse as well, but at that point, why even play the game? I really like Magic and I like what this game has to offer, but if you can't even play the game, it's worthless. I hope to change this review in the future.",0

12296,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"The game was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing for the longest time. Had the game since the orange box days. The game continued being good into the f2p days.  You  used to see your friend jump into tf2 and join their game, no problem. It was the only game I still enjoyed where you could jump into a server, like the old hl2 and counter strike days. Then they put match making in to make the game more like overwatch. If you like that, great. But if I wanted to play overwatch, I'd play ♥♥♥♥ing overwatch.  Not this bs where you have to have a premade group to play with your friends. I don't have a problem with games adding a matchmaking feature on top of their game, that's fine. More features to appease more audience. But they took out what made tf2 great to me; the casual, jump in and play whenever you want aspect that I have come to expect with valve games. Bring back the old valve server paradigm.",0
7251,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,"First of all, I first played War Thunder on my PS4 because back then there weren't much games offered on the console. I got hooked and got serious so I installed the PC version of War Thunder. I never looked back to playing on my PS4 because the controls of keyboard and mouse were just natural to me. Fast forward a year after getting married and there is just not enough extra time to play the game on the PC. I suddenly saw World of Tank Blitz on the android store and I tried it. The concept of a tank having HP was alien to me because in War Thunder once you get shot either you die or you live. Then I began to learn the mechanics and did a switch from War Thunder to Wot Blitz. Fine it's a played down version of WotPC but the matches approximately last only 7 minutes a round and I carry it in my pocket. I got hooked. The mechanics of the game are pretty complex once you get past tier 5. You realize the weaknesses and strengths of each country and tank in particular. You also notice that players get a little more talkative and mean because it really is competitive in the higher tiers and people want to keep their win rates up.All in all I installed it on my ANDROID phone, my wife's IPAD and now my laptop. It's the perfect game for those who don't have much time on their hands or those who are always moving around. I love the game. First bunch of people who did cross platform right. No wonder the owner is one of three billionaires involved in the gaming industry. I already have a year's worth of playtime in this game through handheld devices.

12789,DCS World Steam Edition,2016.0,"I mostly play this clientside, don't look at my Steam playtimeThis review is experience-based, so don't tell me things I cannot know:- Recommended? Yes! It's the best com-flight-sim you can find out there now and it's constantly updated.- Does it run smoothly? Yes, if you have a decent computer with at least 4Gb Ram and 2GhZ processor. Multiplayer requires the double of the SP memory usage, and some heavy lag servers have to be avoided.- Is it free? The base game is free. You get two interesting planes at the beginning, Su-25T and P51 Mustang to learn the basics. To fly other planes, you need the ""modules""- What is a module? A MODULE IS NOT A DLC. It's a game, a really big expansion of basic DCS. It usually contains one brand new aircraft, with it's own fanatically detailed cockpit to mess around, a whole new campaign, new lands... The high price (often on sale) explains how much stuff you can find in a single one.- Should I buy modules? Yes you should, but don't waste money on something you don't like. Surf Youtube, watch some videos about aircraft and buy the one that fits you. - What should I buy? Definetly ""Flaming Cliffs 3"" (tonz of planez bruh) and at least one single-plane module, I'd recommend the Mig21-bis OR the Dassault Mirage 2000.- Is it easy to play? Not really. This simulator is used by real life pilots from the Navy all over the world. You will need to read every page of the manuals and practice, practice, practice again. Brace yourself and prepare to puke on those Gs.- Do I need a joystick? Since planes don't work without it, yes, you need it.- Pros and Cons? PROS: the best flightsim I have ever seen. Top graphics, top realism planes and lands, unforgiving experiences, every step counts. CONS: It's very expensive. Buy your modules carefully, because they cannot be refunded at all.Fun fact: Autopilot will always crash you into something big and sturdy!",1

No other game lets me get spawn killed by a sniper better thanWARMODE *said screaming*No other game makes it so fun to camp behind a crate and wait for the enemy sniper to return just so i can shove my filthy nood knife in his poop hole... but wait! this isnt call of duty with just a normal melee system! This is...WARMODE *said screaming at the top of my lungs while thinking about cutting myself*No! Theres a 1/10 chance you score critical damage killing your enemie with one fell swoop! while the other attack is like hitting him with nerf sword lightly making him cry on the inside because he just realised how how ♥♥♥♥ed  america is if Trump or Clinton wins this election!

I also really like them and I think they look really pretty on this game.I don't know how real racing car handles and feels but this game feels good (I'm using Logitech G920 wheel).But as free game this is merely a Demo, and unlocking everything does have a price.",1

1639,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI like it but it needs improvement. First, a better way to spawn would be nice. Second, it needs a first person perspective option at least.

13042,AdventureQuest 3D,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI can remember playing AQ 10 years ago and the servers were so full that you had to wait to play the singleplayer:)I think you should have used all that time and money to update/upgrade the turn based style AQ into a full f2p game on steam with more MMO elements.You would have won our hearts again.....and we would have surely used a subscription system here too or payments for cosmetic items or to found guilds or claim other buffs.The game as it is....has no magic, no charm, feels like an early alpha indie game. I played a bit in the begining and some now but it just has that grinding feeling with nostalgia.Please make AQ a turn based MMO on steam, this 3d project is too ambitious and unspired to have any lasting effects.You know that most of the positive reviews are from soft hearted AQ players, i wanted to do the same...but you are killing AQ here.PS: i will always love the AQ universe and the game with the mechs even if i don't play them anymore",0

15922,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017.0,"Can't recommend it. Utterly horrid.Judging from the experience I had with this game, the community is the first crucial hole in it. Especially if you're a poor russian sod, who bought this game because your friend recommended you to do so. You'll be kicked from the server, just because guys from other countries thought that your drunk vodka dances wasn't good enough. That always grinds my gears.The gameplay is repetitive and there's nothing to talk about. I'm sure you've played it and know what i mean.Since I haven't much played it lately, there seems to be new payable merch were implemented, like: gloves, something about premium-accounts and ect. If the game tries to show the conflict between SWAT and mujaheddins, let's first get rid of the colored guns and gloves, because on the real war you won't be using any skins to show off to your mates. Soldiers on the war don't usually do that♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they have an objective to destroy the enemy forces, not showing off. The whole concept of skins seems very odd and doesn't fit in a game about the war conflicts. Also, I like the phrase ""Shop for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Merchandise"" on the Steam store page.The summary.I can't belive I spent over 300 hours in this game. The addiction that you might get from this is worse than drug addiction. Just for god sake, don't buy it. There's plenty of games that show war conflicts, like Arma 2 for example.P.S.Yesss! i've managed to give a review on this game on a different language!",0

To me, the voices fit the characters, and convey emotion, without being over the top or too cliche.Gameplay is what you would expect out of a modern TCG.I don't write reviews often, if at all, but this took me by surprise.  Especially since I have seen it in the store before but never really bothered to took a look.",1

14592,The Lord of the Rings Online™,2016.0,"Good game.  But dlc, expansions, content, etc. are relatively expensive if you don't want to grind for Turbine Points.Otherwise, it's a fairly good free to play model for a game that runs well on a potato, and looks good enough.Also, it has a roleplay community on Landroval and Laurelin if you're into that sort of thing.  Or if you aren't, just pretend they're immersive npcs.",1

11791,Magic Duels,2016.0,"TLDR; Free-build or guided decks, zero mandatory expense, grind to get digital cards or pay for them. Bugs include crash, freexe, temp exit to desktop (minimises), card mechanics.Overall, this game is good if you want a preview of the mechanics of a new set before you commit to buying physical cards. It starts you off with a handful of reasonably useful cards (via story mode) and you can grind your way up to a more comfortable collection for free. You are, of course, encouraged to buy cards directly but it is more than plausable to play the game without that -- it's just a bit of a grind at first until you get some more effective card combos together. You get less commons per pack than with physical cards BUT to counter that there seems to be zero risk of excessive repeated cards, which is the main problem with buying packs of physical common cards. It caps at four as you won't need more than four even when building multi decks (shared accross decks.)There is, unfortunately, no way to trade cards with other players.Play against other players or  against bot AI. AI is low reward but easier to consistantly beat after a bit. Modes are solo bot (3 difficulties), multiplayer solo, two-headed giant.Comes with a story mode which is great for seeing the new cards in action; you play a pre-built inflexable deck against another prefab deck. Comes with a guide to basic mechanics called ""skill quests"" which reward you with some tokens for your trouble and are a garunteed win (provided you understand the mechanics and play smart) while they last.Daily quests give you bonus tokens for meeting in-game goals (sac x creatures, ect) Build a deck from the ground up with or without AI guidance, ""auto-complete"" feature and reasonably extensive search filters and deck wizzard for the less experienced.Bugs: sometimes bugs out and goes to desktop for no reason, freezes have been reported and I have seen a full computer crash several times. AI is not always as clever as all that, sometimes getting its own units killed for no reason (Ravenous bloodletter being an example.) Some mechanical bugs have been noted with some cards as well. Alt-tab does not properly minimize the game; it re-opens after being minimised. You have to ctrl-alt-delete and bring up task manager if you want to minnimize it for a moment.Personal opinion: This game makes me angry at times, especially in the early card-grind before you get anything all that good. What I hate most is losing in story mode (where you have zero deck controll) as this seems rather unfair to lose when you can't alter the deck. I also sometimes forget that I do not have all these cards in physical form :( so I get ideas for irl decks and can't use them. All that aside, this game has the deck building side of magic down pat and that's what I most enjoy about MTG anyway.",1
1989,War Thunder,2014.0,"I have a love/hate relationship with this game. Although, it is free! ... -ish.Being an old Starfox veteran, I got on well with the arcadey action in the early game, out-manoeuvring enemies and chopping their wings off with the target-leading system. Each nation has a different set of planes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, although these don't matter too much at this early stage. Needless to say, the bi-plane stage was great fun.Then, gradually, I progressed into the mid-war era of aircraft. This was fun, too, for a while. But then I started to notice a change in the play style of my team mates and my opponents. Instead of rolling away from each other to engage in a dogfight, my opponents would just fly straight towards my plane guns-blazing, then plough straight through me like a battering ram, killing both of us with no points scored either side. Get used to these head-on collisions. They happen a lot. And not just with enemies. Sometimes, you'll be chasing a plane, only to find that a cloud of friendly players has formed around you, fixated on the same target, trying to nab the kill before you do. Because of this tunnel-vision, eventually a team-mate will collide with you, then call you a 'F**KING RAMMER N00B' for your trouble. Lovely.My main problem with this outcome is that there is very little penalty to prevent it on either side. So the conflict just develops into a war of attrition - to see which side has bought the most planes to aimlessly throw into the meat-grinder.Alternatively, you'll get locked in a dogfight with a superior plane (usually a spitfire, with its better turning circle) and no friends will be around to get it off your tail, because 10 of them will be chasing 1 bomber ... and crashing into each other ... and yelling expletives in the chat box.I get the impression that the game wants me to spend money to buy super upgrades for my planes to make them pointlessly unbeatable, like in World of Tanks, or create a squadron of other people who enjoy getting rammed by their team mates. However, my reviewing system is based off the capacity enjoy a game even if you're a friendless hobo. So, if you're looking for some quick arcade dogfighting action, this game is one for you. However, if you're a fan of aviation looking for a dedicated team-based stress buster, you'll find this game utterly infuriating.They will eventually add tanks and ships into the mix, but until then, I'm not convinced.Sorry, Warthunder. You only get 4/10 golden badger eggs. :(",0
1788,Path of Exile,2017.0,"As a new player that felt quite overwhelmed at first with many elements of the game, I can most definitely say that this is one of the better free to play games that you can find and arguably one of the best of its genre. RPG games can be very repetitive but Path of Exile finds a way to make the game fun and fresh with its complex, varied and demanding skill systems, classes, items and bosses. Devs listen to the players and the community is great - little to no toxicity and you find helpful people to party with everywhere.",1
18361,War Thunder,2017.0,"This is probably one of my favorite games I've ever played but unfortunatly it has changed so much I've come to hate it. The grind above tier 3......oh the grind. The XP/income ratio is total♥♥♥♥♥♥and drives you to spend real money. They got greedy. This game was amazing back in 2013. It was simple, fun, somewhat balanced, (more than now) the research template was great, the team play was great. If you've heard the phrase ""don't fix it if it ain't broke"" then this game and dev team failed to do that. In fact they broke it beyond repair and actually think it's good. LOL! So if you want to try it then by all means please do. It's free....to start the game and play 50 hours. After that it's spend money or be stuck in a black hole of grinding until you either die of old age or insanity.....or commit suicide.",0
16036,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you come from Magic and you have no problem with its mana system, you will probably like this game. If you come from Hearthstone, you will be delighted to see no randomness in card mechanics. If you can deal with luck of the draw and some unwinnable games, enjoy! But if you want to be in full control of your game every match, this game is not for you.If you are running from Hearthstone or you want something that is closer to Magic without paying hundreds in Magic Arena, this game may be for you. No randomness in the mechanics of cards! It is a much deeper game than Hearthstone for example, though that is a low bar to clear. It showers you with free cards and entire decks! But power is still tied to rarity, so when you enter draft-mode, make sure to just get the rarest cards.But you will be able to make a very large variety of decks after playing the campaign and doing a few quests and dailies. The grind is definitely more rewarding than most F2P games as well. But in terms of design, it suffers from the exact same falws as Magic. If you do not draw the right cards at the right time it is over. Many people in casual AND Ranked will quit on you after the third round or so because they did not get what they needed at the beginning of the game. And honestly, I understand why. Much like Hearthstone, you can end up with an incredibly overpowered board that your entire deck may not have a single answer to. And those games are painful. I have stopped enjoying my victories as well because all I can think of is ""Poor guy, looks like he didn't draw anything useful, I've been there."" Half of your games will be that exact experience. Either you got the cards you needed or you didn't. Your hand may be full of creatures you do not have the energy to summon, or it is full of energy without creatures to play. This game is still in Early Access and it shows. The UI literally hides important information from you because it currently CANNOT display more than one symbol at the top of cards. Confused why that creature insta-killed yours? Look closer, the game just didn't tell you that this creature has that ability because it was overwritten in the UI by another ability. The game certainly has balance problems as well. As you play against more experienced players, you may encounter cards that you read 5 times before realising that the card is working as intended and your opponent just brought back his two most powerful creatures as well as his two most powerful buffs with a single card that hardly scratched his manapool.

6868,Path of Exile,2017.0,What can be said about this game that hasn't already been said....nothing really but here goes nothing! It's kinda a Diablo 2 clone but does have its own original gamestyle. Is it fun? hells yes! Is it worthy? SCHWING! Is it worth it? Um...let's see...FREE ! I would say yes!! if you are an ARPG fan than jump on the wagon train and ride this puppy cuz your probably not gonna find a better free game of this genre!,1
1007,Path of Exile,2015.0,"Pros:- There is enough customization within the skill tree to let your imagination run wild and create a build that can be as fun and interactive as you want it to be.- Constantly being updated and improved by the Grinding Gear Games team. I started playing during the beta and since then they have added many features including; Act 4, Lockstep, Dominus, Hideouts, and many skill gems and unique items.Cons:- The trade system needs to be looked at in the near future, I should not have to go to a third party site, and look through the listings people submitted using another third party application, either work in some sort of player market or auction house system and let people trade items without alt tabbing out of the game to do so.- Diablo 3 looks and plays a lot more fluidly then PoE, if i drop a few packets in Path of Exile my client will freeze up for a few frames and then play catch up and the game will play in fast forward to catch up to where I should be. This is one reason I will never play on the Hardcore leagues.Conclusion:All in all I would recommend this game to everyone who enjoyed Diablo 2 and is seeking a little extra something after playing Diablo 3.",1
2874,Dreadnought,2018.0,"THIS GAME IS A VIRUS,  STAY AWAY FROM IT!!  NO FOR REAL, ITS AFFECTIVELY A VIRUS DONT TOUCH IT!!!I say this because ever since i loaded it on steam,  i suddenly couldnt play my other steam games and even stuff like youtube videos isnt working.  Webpages are also now slow.  this all happend EXACTLY at the moment i tried installing this game.... DONT TOUCH ITLoved this game as a beta tester.  Now that its all screwed up on steam, im uninstalling it and not touching it again...   Game not only wont load up after installing,  it even forcfully exits me out of steam completely.  Looked all over forums and the web for an answer to this problem and have found no reliable sources to give a solution.  The devs clearly are showing no concern as its aparantly a very common problem and yet no public address of the situation has been given.   All we get is, ""contact support""....   None of my other games on steam have this issue.   It's really quite disheartening to see yet another game full of potential get ruined by poor business devs...  I'm not going to get into specifics of how this game isnt what it use to be but any beta tester here knows what im talking about.   That being said,  no matter what any developer tells you,  always remember that its VERY RARELY a good sign when a game that was once independent suddenly gets contracted through steam.   Why?  because any game that tries to go through steam must pay steam to get such services.  No company in their right mind are going to lose money out to another company without A:  getting good money back, or B: they are not doing successful.With a game like this,  seeing it going on steam is a pretty bad sign that its already tanked and they are just shoving it on steam in hopes of raking in whatever pennies they can before just flat out abbandoning it.  Happens far too often and its really sad....",0

12034,Crush Crush,2017.0,"TLDR: Runwell... where do I begin? It was a bright and sunny tuesday morning, the birds were chirping, and the sweet morning dew covered my front lawn. The crisp cool air, rushed through my hair, as I walked down my front steps to go retrieve me mail. I opened the mailbox door and pulled out the papers within. Running my fingers along the lightly damp envelops I noticed a peculiar letter. ""To whom it may concern,"" it read. ""This coming Friday Feburary the 10th great things will happen."" That is all it said; nothing more was to be found within the envelop except for that letter. I looked up and turned around to retire to my home. I waited three days until that friday, and that's when it all started. When I woke up that morning I felt odd. Something wasn't right. I could feel it. I went about my day, tending to my spice garden, and tinkering with the toys I once played with as a child, reminding me of the days when resposibility was as distant figure standing in the shadows, only to emerge years later as a grotesque beast, that would entomb me. The memories of a long lost childhood, returned for a moment, allowing me to experience the joyous days of years past. I looked up from my desk full of toys only to notice a shimmering light coming from behind me. I turn around only to notice my computer had awoken from sleep, only to display what would be the most terrifying entity in existance. The screen simply read, ""crush crush."" I walkover to my computer and pull my chair out from my desk. I take a seat and put my hand on my mouse. I move the cursor to the button that would forever change me; ""play."" I press my mouse down and the screen goes blank. An instant later a creature with horendous bodily proportions appears on my monitor. My stomach immediately began to churn and my room began to spin in my head, The nausea, although overwhelming, could not stop me from noticing the pain given to me from the game from enslaving my eternal soul. Like a demon from the eternal fires of hell it latched onto my soul, morphed it, violated it. Before I could think again the most vile creature that I have ever encountered. The ears stood tall, but the body stood taller. the creature, a neko girl. My heart raced and a sharp pain raced down my arm. My breathing grew heavy, then silence. My pulse was no more. I shattered the screen with the last ounce of strength I had. The screen went blank and the glass that made up the panel was shattered into thousands of shards. I looked at my monitor and could see my distortred reflection in the fractured panel of glass. I watched as I took what I was sure would my last breath. My vision went dark along with my thoughts. I awoke in a hospital bed. lines from bags of saline ran down and into my arm. The doctor walked in. ""you're lucky to be alive he said."" ""what happened?"" I ask him. He looked at me, then glanced down to the right, ""crush crush.""Please save yourself the pain. If you value your life go nowhere near this detriment of a game.

13054,Fallout Shelter,2017.0,"Fallout Shelter is a good fun little game where you manage the development of a fallout shelter.The cartoon-style drawings are nicely done.The general structure of this game seems to have been well thought out.You acquire resources to expand the size of your base, recruit people, and send out some hardy adventurers on quests.The requirements for food, water, and power seem to be balanced.The emergency incidents that occur have not seemed to be out of proportion to the resources at hand (so far, at least).Fallout Shelter is essentially a management game.However, in some ways it is almost like a clicker game, albeit quite an advanced one. You have to keep on going back and forth between production units to keep the resources flowing. And there are long waits for the completion of quests, and the production of some resources and skill levels, to encourage players to get impatient and purchase upgrades (microtransactions).Sending Vault-dwellers out on quests can take a long time, unless you use your bottles of ""Nuka-Cola Quantum"" (which speeds up the journeying), but such bottles are few and far between  unless you feel like spending some real-life money on buying some more (yes, there's the catch).Your questers engage in battles versus enemies in various buildings, but it's action of just a very basic nature (no first person shooting happens in the game).The fate of those people who go out into the Wasteland, to explore, is relayed to you via lines of text; you don't actually see them in action, unless they go into a quest building (which you have to authorise).Mostly the game is about managing the resources of your base, or ""Vault"".I quite like Fallout Shelter. From my point of view, the pros far outweigh the cons.Be warned that you will need a goodly store of patience to play this game (which brings to mind the old prayer, ""God grant me patience, but hurry up about it!""); so, if you aren't a patient person, you might want to let this one pass by; but, if patience is one of your virtues, then this might just be the game for you.If you're a patient person who enjoys a bit of post-apocalyptic fun, then I recommend that you give this game a try.*********************P.S. People should be aware that there is a major problem with this game, although it is easily overcome.If your game crashes, or your computer crashes, then you can lose your entire game (apparently it's something to do with it then not synchronising with the Steam cloud).This drama has happened to many people, whereby they have lost all of their many hours of game progress.You need to back up your game.The location for saved game files is in the second-last section (""Backing up your saved game files for Fallout Shelter"") in this guide:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=904883576 ",1

616,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access Reviewcool game buddy,i tries aq3d open beta. in closed it would only take a day to reach level 12 as i heard from other players but in open beta it would take a lot longer now. ive read comment and i know its a review. but AE should make a site where they could also read it that way it would help them develop their game. yes the games sucks♥♥♥♥♥♥right now no skill tree only 4 skill which i think sucks since it wont be immersive like wow where you get to choose want kind of character you are. like tanker defender or a bit of both. i think this was a bit rushed. when i heard about aq3d i thought of all the potential it could have the moment i logged in my hopes were instanly crushed. i mean seriously you already have all skills available and you could buy the other class for free except for guardian. i don’t hate the game i still play and hope it might slowly change and get better but really you have to grind and there are key to enter a dungeon. i saw in one of there post since the limit is only 3 player they limit by putting keys so other players can enter. why not build multiple dungeon like dungeon-1, dungeon-2 and etc multiple dungeon so that people can enter. is AE becoming greedy. i really loved aqw. my friends helped me grind to level 65 and helped me farm for ArchPaladin took me hours and days to complete all quest and i’m fine with have a multiple class game makes it better who want to have the same class as everyone it just gets boring and most people start talking♥♥♥♥♥♥about aq3d and then after this post they will say to me i’m an idiot and i don,t know and that the game sucks. and then they will say i,m just stating the facts yes what you guys say are true. but you just have to be patient. heck during the finale of the dark throne saga there were about 18k players. aqw is not dead and aq3d still has potential. if i were to review it i would give it 7.5/10 its not perfect at first just like aqw 8 years ago but it was still fun. so to people out there who have issues with this game don’t play it and i know its just your review but if what you reviewed is not to your liking don’t play it then people have diffrent taste in game. me im a gamer i really play anything that gets me intrested even in aqw i wasn’t a member but look at me now im level 65 and no i did not use any bot cause i,m afraid of getting banned, i farmed in shadow realm everyday after school. and i did my homework after that. but aq3d is kinda ok. i just hate farming. even today the gap between 14-15 is about 738000. i see a bunch of level 15 who i think used exp pots and gold pots (boost) it takes at least a week to farm for that but sice the level cap is only 15 but when they increase the level cap they might adjust it. i just hope they might improve this game soon befor its too late. and by the way im a hardcore AE fan dont tell me im an idiot just because of that. im not here to judge you since your the ones playing.good luck and recommended",1
1784,Business Tour - Board Game with Online Multiplayer,2018.0,I don't know how the game mechainic works. All i do know this game is 110% BIASED and has no RNG to it. The map is way too small and the chance of luck/something to happen is way to high for it to be a random dice roll. - Business Tour master.,0
1218,Aura Kingdom,2014.0,"At very first I must say I enjoyed the game a lot.. for a while. I don't like anime at all but I was very bored and I decided to try a game outside of my comfort zone. The graphics is ok, music is bit of repetetive and story was ok. Although the missing voice acting makes this product feel like low budjet game.The game is extremely grindy. You can get levels quite fast at the beginning by doing quests but after level 45 things will change. The main quest ends about level 55 and after that you have to grind your level through dailies and dungeons. And that's really painful indeed.  Actually the one thing I liked was that you can run some of the dungeons on solo mode. So you actually had something to do while you waited your guildies to gather their group for 5 men dungeon run. I liked also the skill system and especially the thing that you can spend the attribute points like you really want. However there isn't too much options for effective character builds and that's the reason it feels very simple.Crafting is also typical Korean style click&pray function. You farm the materials, find/buy the blueprint and click the ""craft"" -button. I was quite surprised when I saw the dumbed down crafting system because even the fishing is one kind of mini game. There aren't any kind of level or skill system for crafting or fishing. Fishing ""skill"" is based on your fishing gear and crafting level is equal with your adventure level. Nothing special... or actually there is. The crafting is huge money sink because the challenge is replaced with carfting costs.Well, that was the game play in nut shell. Now I'm going to tell some things that I didn't like at all. The backpack size is very limited at the beginning. This encourages player to buy some more backpacks with APs. The AP is a game currency that you can only get with real money. Sure you can buy those backpacks with loyalty points later but you really have to play a lot to get enough points for 20 slots backpacks. Some people are sellng those through the AH but because of gold farmers the prices are very high.Aaaannd.. those gold farmers. Seriously! That's the biggest issue in game at the moment. There is hundreds.. or even thousands of bots those are questing, doing dailies and killing stuff. For example I was in Navea (capital city) and counted over 120 bots running in same loop in 30 minutes. Can you imagine? The similar looking red haired gunners had a long endless train from quest givers to another. It was insane! I played GW2 since the beta and I thought there was very large number of bots. But no.. the amount of bots is nothing to compare the number of bots in AK. There is more bots in game than actually real players and Arial Games just can't get rid of them. People are buying gold and gold farmers are making more bots. There is already some lag issues because of botting and reporting doesn't help at all. That's is the reason I quit this game and I just can't recommended this game to anyone. Oh, except if you need a good platform for bot or two. This game is definitely suitable for that.",0
2020,Realm Grinder,2017.0,Got hooked by this clicker/idle game. It has so much depth in comparison to other games of this genre and the way new elements are introduced is very well done.Also the events are pretty cool.It seems that buying rubies doesn't help very much.

6797,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewDid you enjoy CoD 2 and Battlefield 2? Good becouse you just found mixture of those two with graphic update.Gameplay is slower than in most of todays FPS shooters, there is no run and die if you play properly.You strategize and advance to destroy enemy, even one soldier can change outcome in big battle if given opportunity.Pros You choose your playstyle- rush, hidden, conqueror, recon,you customize your soldiers,great feel of battle, there is always way to counter your opponent no 3 snipers blocking any movementlot of choices overall,Great maps, cycles of day and diferent objectives on same map so you will play same map 3 times in a row without even noticing it.ConsIf you are not enjoying it you will quit becouse you see the grind ahead of you,Nothing tells you that you should save those reward money at start to buy something you really want to have fun later and make more money,Squads, squads are great until you find out you cant pair with different class until you reach certain level where you can personalize your squad too.Overall good game, with few tweaks it will be awesome ",1

7088,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI know many people have wrote that this game has bitcoin mining stuff in it or stuff like maleware but don't believe that. As for the premissions you can literally disable all the access RoE tries to get by going to the launcher -> right click -> properities -> security -> edit premissions and deny everything. Been playing this game long enough to tell that it's clean and I checked it with antivirus scan and it's clean. I beleive that most of these negative reviews are made by rival battle royale games. I wouldn't be surprised if pubg players did that just so that it affects the game.Also, as of now, there are no EU servers so when you download the game it will ask you if you're from EU and a bunch of other countries, say ""No"" and you will get access to the game. If you say Yes you will have to close the game and reopen it and the same question will popup. say no to that.As for the actual game play, It's not bad at all, fun but there are few things that they need to work on (which they are) and I believe in the matter of few months this game will be better than pubg. Would be sick if they could optimize this game better because the Fps drops in the Ice map are insane sometimes.",1

This is the best idea you have had Artix, but and yes there is a but, it would be so much more if y'all would take a little time and invest it in making the standard controller work or even the steam controller. I have played and it is difficult for me at best, I grew up on the older gaming consoles I'm about to turn 50 if that tells you anything(remeber pong, I do and remember playing it) it is so much easier if you have a controller even if it is just a partial like movemnent and attacks, please for all that is in the heart of all dragon lords and wizards give us a controller.

The game is very fun with some dynamic fights that can take place especially in squads. I think this game is worth a download and try for anyone who enjoys a battle royale type game.I've seen some reviews say that the playerbase is indicative of how the devs killed the game.

14395,Elsword,2015.0,"Elsword is a 2.5D action-packed side scrolling MMO brawler with that certain anime charm. It borrows a lot of mechanics and functionality from side scrolling brawlers and fighting games but simplifies them into an easy to learn experience while still retaining the intricacies and mastery that fighting games have been known for resulting in a game that's enjoyable for all kinds of players. Even though the game does not feature a character creator like most other MMOs, it instead opts to give you a selection of colorful characters to choose from, which meant that the game had a lot more personality and flair going for it by comparison to other games in its genre. While the game uses cosmetics and a pay-for-convenience business model, you can pay for pretty much everything that's not account tied (such as extra inventory space) from the community market with in-game currency which is pretty nice.While it is a really fun game to play, especially with friends, it does fall into the trappings that most Korean MMOs come with being their grindy nature and severely expensive item shops.

It differs from the original Counter-Strike (Known as '1.6' because there are 1.6 people still playing) in the fact that it's not 37 years old.Counter-Strike Hardline refines the tried and true formula of Police (Voiced by Nolan North) vs Counter-Police (Voiced by Troy Baker), bringing in many new faces to each team, such as Jewish Toad from Super Mario Bros, a black guy, a ghost with a beret, and a hot topic customer.Counter-Strike: Black Ops adds exactly 3 new zones for you to wreak havoc in, bringing the total amount of maps to 1, but makes up for it with a large arsenal of over 70 weapons, which I will now list for you.-Ak-47-M4-AWPAll in all, Counter-Strike: Global Defensive is a robust top down open world third person beat 'em up that tweaks the gunplay to its best, with amazing graphics and sound design, it's bound to keep you hooked until Counter-Strike 5.0/5",1
16213,Magic Duels,2015.0,"[Updated review: you can read my initial thoughts below.]Ironically, the reason why I decided to try Magic Duels again was that Hearthstone, the game I compared it to (and praised) in original review, had become a horrible experience for me. Without going too much into it, HS is filled to brim with insane powercreep, broken mechanics, horrible formats and the worst card-collection experience overrall with a forced rotation that makes your past collection useless. So, I come back to Magic Duels with pretty optimistic expectations - I'm glad that the technical issues that plagued the game have been solved, and the exact things I want, the depth of counterplay and variety of logical mechanics are there. So why haven't I changed the review for a positive one?The problem is, the game still feels extremely limited. While the game supports counterplay with time to react to your enemies actions, the game is still extremely casual-ized compared to its IRL counterpart. The limited card pools and rarity restrictions force decks to play on very broad strategies - and without BO3 format there's still zero reason to play tech cards over universally functional ones. Another problem still is the card collecting system. Its really hard to actually upgrade the powerlevel of decks you're intially given since you can never craft a bunch of cards you need. Instead, you're forced to grind card packs that give you single copies of random cards until you little by little collect all the cards of specific collection (4 copies of each common, 3 of each uncommon, 2 rares, 1 mythic)So, to sum it up - Magic Duels isn't worse than HS, but it still fails to reach the depth and competitiveness of the original product. For those interested in what I'm referring to, check out 'Cockatrice', the free community-created platform, or offical MTG online - or go outside and find your local game store![Old review:] I might have had too high expectations for this game considering it's title and genre. But when your best comparison is Heartstone, this game fails to deliver. The pure gameplay is way too clunky, and its really easy to miss game-changing opportunities just because of the weird 'you have this much time to stop time'-mechanic. I was really hoping for a free-to-play steam multiplayer with rules and skill ceiling as high as original MtG, but Duels is as limited in it's card/mecanic pool as Heartstone.The latter of games also tackles the 'card gathering' part better, as you have no control over what cards you get on Duels. This resulted in that i had zero ways to even try different kinds of borderline janky tactics (that most often are the most hilarious). I also really regret that we still have no implementation of an actual 'competitive' possibilty with BO3 and sideboards to actually give you a chance to fight against bad matchups.BUT focusing on the Duels, it's pretty buggy by itself, with lots of visual glitches and connection problems (you need a constant internet access to do anything worthwhile in this game) and overrall bad servers. There's a lot of wrong in this game, the highest being the daily credit limits (??). Also, most of the achievements (and cards that are mandatory for them) are impossible to get without grinding this game for ages. 2/10 sad amputated brother of it's irl namesake and a really below average game by itself.",0

Unlike many other games of its kind, you can get access to most of the content without paying a dime.

14331,PlanetSide 2,2018.0,"I was hesitating to get this since I'm not really a fan of f2p games, especially not f2p shooters.After being massively bored with Overwatch and not having any idea what to play I stumbled over this game last week and thought ""I should at least give it a try"". I ended up binge playing the game ever since.This game has to be one of the most amazing shooters I played in a very long time (playing FPS ever since CS 1.6) and the teamwork is top notch.People actually do play their roles, engis run at you to throw you some ammo when you ask for it, medics actually do heal and revive you, people driving/ flying transport trucks or choppers actually do stop to let you hop in and then taxi you to the combat area.Whenever you help/ resupply/ heal/ revive your teammates, everyone is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing friendly and always saying ""thank you""...it's surreal almost. I mean, yes, it's just a small thing but it's outstanding in this game.I'm 40-50hrs in by now and I rarely have seen people actually flaming and insulting others.Granted, the graphics are dated, but I personally don't care. Coming from Overwatch (both PC and XB1) I've seen more teamplay in this game already in 50hrs than in 2 years of Overwatch and this is where the fun comes from.As said, graphics are dated (they are okay but nothing too fancy) but you have to decide what you want to play: a nice looking game that is just yet another generic FPS with stale gameplay and maybe a toxic community...or a fantastic team oriented FPS, that is fairly balanced with a fantastic community, where every class has it's pros and cons but with slightly dated graphics.I personally am having MASSIVE fun with this game.Give it a try, you won't regret!",1

5728,World of Warships,2018.0,"Wargaming is ruining this game over time, the same as they did World of Tanks.  WoW is ok but with 20 minute battles, it frequently becomes a somewhat boring slog.  Limited maps, limited goals, limited differences in play styles within classes of ships (kind of expected since this is ocean warfare), huge grind to progress up the ranks - it all adds up to a game that  is worth it if you just want a free game to play but it isn't worth spending money on in-game.",0

2261,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Awfully buggy in this ""MMORPG"" you be lucky if your party goes along in a instanced quest, even when everyone is indeed synchronized in the same quest you might not get instantiated in the boss fight, along with your partners or might have to do the quest n times where n is the number of party members.Party system is awful, you can't get your party in the same chain quest without a horrible amount of voice chat and constant and stressful check. Asking: Is everyone in the ""quest name""? when there are 5 people is very bad. There a plenty of good examples of games whom did this right and this game does nothing of it.Some quests are downright broken and won't work at all, others are poorly planned like planting a bomb on a mob that spawns every 5 minutes twice (while other 10 full parties of 5 players dispute them with you).Poorly optimized game so you get High MS and low FPS, it goes as low as 3FPS if there is anyone attacking near you. I found out that using the integrated graphic card helps in the FPS, but then it takes around 5 minutes to load a map.Because of all that, all the boss fights get really stupid. Doing a encounter with high MS is already very frustrating, now try doing that with low FPS. Simply dysfunctional.Constant crash, the game stop responding at random or you get disconnect from a channel after changing mapsThe game is 3 days old and already can't deal with spamming bots, imagine when this thing goes open.Overall I felt like a pre alfa tester, I can't recomend this to anyone.",0
18386,Realm of the Mad God,2017.0,This is a game with lots of potential that ishaving its success shadowed by its lack of systematic story telling. The gaming world right now could use some pixelated MMO that would bring a sense of nostalgia to its audience and it that sense this game has been very sucessfull it would have been alot better if they could up the technology behind the game a little bit. maybe add fullscreen mode or get rid of some of the bugs or the insane server lags when you have alot of people in one area. Overall its a game that I highly recommend for any MMO fans out there.,1
4749,Black Squad,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEhh it is what it is.. for a FREE game its ok.. but that's it.. the controls are sluggish even after tweaking them, the lobbies and rooms a bit laggy when you are like one of two in the entire server with a ping under 40 and everyone else is  150 to 250. That in its self is a game breaker for myself... But again for a free game its not bad, if you can handle unrealistic gun handling, aiming, and movement. It's like an unreal tornement game with COD type guns and look, but without everything that makes those games what they are lol. Sorry it's a no for me!!",0
7449,Path of Exile,2016.0,"First review:It's ok.... i guess.Edited version:The amount of effort the devs put into making this game better is truly astounding. I played PoE in beta, thought it was a decent game, then promptly got sidetracked by all the other games in my library. Came back to it in late 'Forsaken Masters' expansion and havent left it. I can count the number of days that i haven't played PoE since then on my hands, its that good.Always new content, always more lore, always more optimization coming out. Think of it as a Diablo-esqe kinda feeling game, with more depth, steeper learning curve and more praying to the RNG gods for good loot.TL;DR:  Well balanced game. Great Devs. Awesome community.",1
718,War Thunder,2017.0,"Very grindy, repetitive and lacks any meaningful progression for new players.  The ""main"" in-game currency is useless for early progression and research points, which are essential to unlocking modifications and aircraft, are extremely difficult to obtain.   The result is many many missions in early era aircraft going against much better planes all of the time with almost no reward.",0
1802,Elsword,2014.0,"This game is very fun and addicting, it reminds me of a japanese sidescrolling beat'em up. And while it does have good gameplay, it does cost alot of money to play.I tried to play it without spending any money and it was impossible seeing the fact that I picked a character that ended up needing more slots to hold magic (In this game you have to spend 9$ To use 8 spells instead of 4). So I finally broke down and got some money on to the game and it's been more fun.I'm in a love hate relationship with this game. I love to play it, but it makes my wallet dry.

The people I played with were friendly and helpful, so if you ever do not understand something just ask, and they should help.I look forward to further developement of this game!",1
1476,DCS World Steam Edition,2016.0,"The worst thing about this game are the prices for the more in-depth cockpits, but most likely if you spend that much on them in the first place, it will be very worth it. DCS is nothing short of amazing. It feels awesome to fly the planes, the learning curve is there, but after a few days, it's all down and good. The planes have weight to them, and even the simplest of maneuvers and procedures can't be done by just jumping in and acting like you know what you're doing.If you aren't an experienced pilot, no worries. You can start with circling airfields and landing at others, move onto some strafing runs, go to bombings, SEAD, and by then, you'll probably have purchased FC3.Speaking of FC3, researching the expansion will likely tell you that you need the others, which isn't true anymore. It's an awesome expansion for learning to fly. FC3 is basically the bridge between the SU-25 and aircraft like the A-10C.It's a great game, and it's free to start off. If you like aircraft, whether it be FSX, ArmA, IL-2, or any other simulator, you will like this game.*Also, even though the photos show the SU-24, and some other planes, you cannot fly any planes that aren't A). the SU-25T, or B). listed in a DLC.*",1

I've made good friendships with friendly people. Looking back to the time I was playing 4-5 hours a day... I don't regret anything.

This is my review of ROBOCRAFT I am very expirenced in this game I have over 2000 hours :p (Yes for a while I did forget about a life) I have been playing since 2014 near launch back then it was a very fun game and no P2W at all. Yes their was grinding but not as much now. I personally prefer the old system for money it was better than haveing to grind for crappy crates. I think things went downhill after the META update the crates got added they changed alot of stuff and messed up the game and such. But as you can see much of the community has the same views as me so im going to have to say no to this game but as always it is up to you if you like the game. :),0
651,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018.0," Valve Anti CheatOkay Valve. I spent $20 dollars on this game only for it to go free just a year later? I want my money back.I was really annoyed at the time this review was written, so pardon my redundant vocabulary throughout this review.Valve taking advantage of their customersComparable to other greedy f**knuggets in the gaming industry, today, Valve has set the bar up there with EA and Bethesda.You know what Valve, instead of using all that money and resources you got sitting over there to give us, your customers, our long awaited sequels we've respectfully requested since 2004. Example: Half Life 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3 etc. You @$$holes think your next best move is to create a battle royale mode for a $20 dollar game you released 6 years ago, that has randomized loot box Activision/EA microtransactions? Hey here's an idea, Valve: How about you lazy f**ks start tending to the rampant issue of hackers in this effing game. By making this game free, you open a large window for hackers and other cheaters; they've invaded Counter-Strike faster than the Germans invaded Poland. Cheaters are just showing up in Prime Matchmaking; what the hell's the point of even paying $15 dollars for the Prime Status Upgrade? What the hell is this, Valve? As a matter of fact, I stopped playing this game last year because of this problem. Why make Counter-Strike: Global Offensive free? Ah, so you can attempt to hook and entice people to purchase your stupid $2.50 one time use keys for your BS randomized loot boxes to maximize profit.Valve's GreedYour intentions, your methods have not changed at all. The one time you want to create content other than cosmetic skins to sell separately, you decide to jump on the popular battle royal train to maximize profit. I mean, really? A battle royale mode for Counter-Strike? Doesn't that seem a little strange and unnecessary for a game like this? What, are we gonna see a battle royale mode in Rainbow Six next month? Like I stated earlier, there are infinitely better and creative things you can make with all those resources. As if you haven't got enough money from hosting tournaments, video game sales and loot box sales, you need more money? What are you trying to prove with this?The fact that you even thought this was a good idea proves your intentions, this showcases your true nature batter than anything else. You don't give a damn about the customers, the players, the fans, you don't give a f**k. You care about money, and that's it. There's more important things in life, Valve. You can make money without being a piece of sh%t.EpilogueI can't support Valve anymore. I can't do it. This is the end of my respect for this company, who once represented the best for PC gamers. People are gonna look back at this and approach Valve with caution. I am done with you, Valve. After Dying Light 2 is released, I'll be looking for another source to purchase my video games from.This really does suck. The gaming industry has done a great job at gradually pushing me away from it with their sickening lack of respect for their audience, as I have watched over the last decade how game series I used to adore have been ripped apart for the sake of loot box supply drop microtransaction systems, and Counter-Strike is no different. So all of that is literally every major aspect of the game and I enjoy none of it for the reasons I just stated.Oh yeah and all of you writing positive reviews for this game today are effing morons.Here's a clip to summarize my experience in Counter-Strike: Global OffensiveBut tell me what you think. Am I overreacting? Or is what I say pretty spot on?Tell me your thoughts and opinions in the comments below.",0
2283,theHunter Classic,2018.0,"This might be one of the best games for any hunting enthusiast out there. **Summary for anyone too lazy to read it all:**- An amazing game for people that love simulators and slowpaced games- Is free to play, but has microtransactions and a ""premium membership"" that will enhance your experience. *This does not determine what animals you find etc, that's just luck!*- Very customizable. Buy the gear/weapons and hunt how you want-New content being added on a regular basis with an active developer team- Strong community- Competitions and missions to earn both premium currency and free currency. Sometimes even items! - Interesting and diverse species list. Animals also have habits and different behaviours- The ability to save your most impressive kills as trophyshots or taxidermize them and showcase them in your trophy lodge- OK graphics. Game is old so not surprising. Improvements are being made however- Do not play if you lack the patience to track a possibly wounded animal for over an hour to get another bullet in it! (You don't have to, but come on, don't let that poor pixel critter suffer!)**Full review**I can not stress this enough, if you enjoy slow paced simulators, the outdoors, hunting and animals, this is perfect for you! I can sit for hours in my tree stand just calling in passing wildlife, enjoy a driven hunt with friends, or simply wander around enjoying the enviornment and calm. However, once that trophy (or maybe that rare albino buck that you've only been able to dream of) stands in front of you, you're really going to experience the thrill of the hunt. I've lost count on the amount of times buck fever has gotten the better of me and I've messed up a shot. But if you successfully bring down your quarry all that patience will have been well worth it. Take a trophyshot with your trophy animal, and send it to your trophy lodge where you can view it whenever you please. You can also show your friends and tell them the story of when you brought down that awesome animal! In this game you have the opportunity to learn the routines and habits of the animals, when they sleep, eat and travel. There is no hints in game to hold your hand with this, it is all up to you to go out there and explore the reserves on your own. New reserves and species are added every now and then, with new guns, outfits, equipment, and hunting dogs. New content is getting added a few times a year, adding to the fun and to your hunting experience. Let's adress the elephant in the room. The microtransactions. Yes, this is a free to play game, and therefore you'll have the opportunity to buy additional gear from the free gear that you get when launching the game for the first time. All players get a .243 bolt action rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun (complete with birdshot, buckshot and slugs), as well with some basic clothing for all climates and a deer bleat caller (with some more additional basic equipment). This is more than enough to hunt every species in the game excluding the bison and water buffalo. There are 3 free species to hunt: Whitetailed deer, pheasant and european rabbit. In addition to that 2 random species will be on a weekly rotation for all players to hunt! If you want to hunt any species at any time, you have two options: - You either buy a membership. This will allow you to hunt anything and host multiplayer games. or- You do missions in game to earn the free currency in the game to buy licences. Licences range from one day to a month, and are available for any species. *This seem to be the majority's issue with the game and I understand. But at the same time... If you buy a game, play it for 20 hours and never touch it again for 60 bucks, why not get a year's worth of fun for 30?* **Just make sure you enjoy the game enough to actually use said membership**Guns and other equipment are available in the store for the premium currency. This currency can be bought with money, or earned in competitions. Some items like consumables (scent eliminator, wind indicator etc.) are available to purchase for the free in game currency. **Any equipment or guns (non consumables) you buy will remain in your inventory and maps after you purchase them**Even if the graphics are slightly outdated, the game isn't terrible looking, and new upgrades are being made to visuals pretty often considering the age of the game. They recently increased the render distance for animals and items with an additional 100 meters, which made a huge difference to gameplay. The visuals are decent, and I even find some moments when I find the game beautiful. The game has aged well in my opinion. However, if graphics matter the most to you, I can recommend theHunter: Call of the Wild instead! Over all, this is one of my favorite games in my library. But I do understand if people tire or find the membership/microtransactions awful. 7/10, well worth my time!Happy hunting!",1
244,Brawlhalla,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewPeople compare this game to Smash and while I can see why, you can't expect exactly Smash. It is different. The game looks good, sounds good and feels good. All characters have little backstories that I loved reading, and the characters feel different while still making them all playable once you have played the game a bit. I'd give it about a 9/10.Edit: My previous review didn't do this game justice. This game, is amazing. Brawlhalla is a 2D fighter similar to that of Smash Bros. But it's not a clone, it's more of an adaption. There are new mechanics that change the way the game plays, Every character has stats. Play a balanced fighter, a slow tank, a glass cannon, a speedy attacker or whatever one fits your playstyle. There are different tiers on ranked. Starting with Bronze, then Silver, then Gold. There maybe more after it like Diamond or Platinum but I haven't reached it. All the characters have lore behind them. Like Bodvar, the warrior who was afraid no one could beat him in battle so he marched up to the Gods himself. This review is going to be updated as new updates occur.The community is actualy turning...funny. I haven't got a single ""GG"" in a while. When people actually do say something its about ""Bodvar too OP I could beat you if you chose a different char"" or ""Stop using Sentinel he's broken loser"" Except usually spelled wrong.",1

I've never played any Magic game, I was always more of a YuGiOh fan, but finally I decided to give Magic Duels a try.There's one thing you need to know- don't listen to people saying this game is grindfest. Sure, you earn just 5 gold for easy AI win (10 for medium, 15 for hard), sure there is a daily limit of 400 gold, and sure, there are only 6 cards in boosters. But there's one thing they don't usually mention- you will never get more copies of a card from booster than you are allowed to use in deck! If you'd play Magic Duels and get 400 gold every day, you could get all the cards from Origins set in under a month! A MONTH. Name another online CCG where you could get every available card in game under a month without spending a penny. (with the Zendikar expansion there are more cards, so you'd need more than a month now to get them all, but still it's not that bad).Seriously, I've seen much worse grind CCGs (looking at you, Duel of Champions...)And it's completely free.

13768,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"Easily my favorite card game. There are a lot of little things that I really enjoy about it, but there are two big factors for me. Legends has two lanes, that (with rare exceptions) do not interact with each other. One if the field lane, which is exactly like Hearthstone's board. The other is the shadow lane, which is the same with the exception that all minions summoned here gain stealth (they can't be attacked) for one turn. The shadow lane mechanic effectively makes board control non-binary, which makes games dramatically more interesting. Then there are prophecies and runes. You have 30 health, and at each interval of 5 beneath that you have a rune (25/20/15/10/5). When you reach that health value, the rune triggers and you draw a card. This is a nice catch up mechanic in and of itself, but then there are cards with the ability ""Prophecy"". These cards are able to be played for free, immediately when you draw them off of a rune. Prophecies at seemed like awful RNG, but they've grown on me quite a lot. They add a lot of depth and decision making processes that otherwise wouldn't be there, and the rng they add overall is still quite a lot less than land in MTG or just good old fashion randomness in Hearthstone.These two mechanics together make games feel a lot more unique and gives me a lot more to think about compared to Hearthstone, but still has the same basic gameplay pattern and ease of play that made me love Hearthstone all those years ago.",1

6280,Bless Online,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI've watched reviews, I've watched streamers and even when  90% of them said stay away.. I brought the game.. Mistake #1 was not trusting a MAJORITY. Now, I am not someone who leaves negative comments on things in general (dining, movies, games), but this game... Yea, 2 hours only played but I think I've watched / played enough to know what a horrible game looks like.Bless Online - It's like a child's painting when they're only 4 years old. You praise them even though you know its just scribbles and color. That's what Bless Online is. Far from the graphics and animation that looks nice, there isn't anything else there. So many people will say it's because it's in Early Access, but it's like others have said already. Failed in 2 regions, they had enough time to correct issues.. And without properly giving the game a beta test so MAYBE they could've spotted these issues earlier, they opt for EA. Cash grab? Maybe.. Wouldn't go that far. Carekess? 100%It's like a server who would bring you out desert before your entree, followed by your appetitizer and finally your entree. Like what the hell bro..Probably will get some hate from others who swear and abide by this game but I am sorry. This is horrible.. I really wanted to like this game.. I really did. Maybe if it doesn't shut down, I'll try it again at the end of the year or something.. At least it's not like a paperweight that I have to throw out.. I can just uninstall.",0
7985,Path of Exile,2014.0,"A Free2Play game, not a Pay2Win!I have always kept my distance from MMO/RPG games, I've only lightly dabbled in them, none giving me the will to keep playing them. However, POE has done it for me. Compared to some other MMO/RPGs, POE has a bit darker, grittier feel to it.If you are new to this genre of game, it can be very overwhelming. The passive skill tree is very intimidating and at first will make anyone weak in the knees.You can literally create thousands of different character builds, if not more.Give this game a try!

They have plenty of character builds for you to follow and information about races and upcoming events where you can win special items!Also check out their store for daily deals, cosmetic enhancements, pets and extra storage for your stash!From the POE website FAQ. 6.

1135,Path of Exile,2018.0,"Honestly, I love many parts about this game... but I can't overlook a couple things about it.  TLDR: Path of Exile does not value your time.  If you have a carreer, or family, or anything else in your life, PoE is not made for you.  You would have to spend thousands of hours to get to play all the way through the game, and that is horrendous in my opinion.  A game should be fun, challenging, and rewarding.  Forcing people to pull the lever on a slot machine is not real difficulty.  Their main goal is to keep the carrot danging in front of you, and you will never, ever, find the game you want.  It's all about the chase, and at the end you will have nothing to show for it.What I love:1) The customization is super deep and very enjoyable.2) There are lots of activities to grind and feel like you are making progressWhat I hate:1) You will have to trade.  Other players will do their best to rip you off.  It is a job to become knowledgable about the market so that you can properly price and trade items, but investing hours pouring over pages of item prices won't make you good at it.  Some people play this game for the ""economy"" and enjoy trading and becoming stupid wealthy... to them I say fine.  Enjoy flipping currency and buying out items to inflate prices.  I will go play SSF... except you will never find the items you need, and you can't craft endgame items for a targeted build.  So either learn to love poe.trade or play a different game.  Hint: play a different game.2) Crafting is so absurdly expensive that you should never try it.  It is deep, but you will blow every single currency item you have before you see the item of your dreams.  You may be able to accidently craft something other people could use, but then you have to find out what it's worth and trade it.  Or play SSF, and never see the great items you want to make your obscure builds work.3) Gating content behind RNG... So Breaches spawn randomly, and then they drop a random number of shards, and then when you finally get 100 (could take 15-50 breaches.. no joke sometimes they drop 2), the Breach boss has an RNG chance to drop a unique item.  They don't have to drop, which is suppperr frustrating.  Took me months to finall run a breach and Xoph dropped nothing.  Was crushing.  In SSF I can't just run it again...Another example is uber atziri.. I've never fought her.  I map fragments drop randomly, and there is no recepie to trade them up.  So you will be waiting for midnight fragments to randomly drop... then Atziri has a random chance to drop fragments for her more difficult version... and again you will never get the rare fragment you need.  Another example is Shaper.. I have never fought him because I can't get the maps to drop in order to fight him.  I have played over 1000 hours in SSF and still i'm missing some of the shaper fragments.  Sustaining tier 15's is impossible.  I can sustain 11-12's but past that it is random that if you get the maps you need.  The more maps you finish the LESS likely the map you need will drop.  Infuriating as all hell.  Never fought uber elder or even Red spawn elder... not because I can't kill it, but because I can't get the maps to drop to kill his guardians.Why are prophecies weighted by rarity?  You will get the same 10 prophecies that do nothing over and over again.  You will never see the ones that you find exciting.  Plagues of frogs and lost maps forever.  Smothering tendrils? ughSo Basicallllyy... It is a cluster of RNG on top of RNG.  It's a slot machine, and all the ""skill"" in the world won't help you.4) Party play sucks.  People just rip through maps in this game.. like literally a whole map (like 40 screen widths) in about 2 minutes, then rush through the next one.  The game is balanced around this and you have to go that fast to see profit.. there isn't a way to go slow in a dangerous map and see the same returns.  It's all about easy maps as fast as possible.  You will feel like people pulling you through the whole game.  This game has to be tuned down so that the pace is more reasonable, then they could retune the drops to also be more reasonable.Another problem with party play is the sheer number of sparkly things and circles and rings and projectiles.  It's is impossible to see what is going on.  Generally everything is dead the second you see it, but if it's not you wouldn't be able to tell.If you love this game, I could understand why, but don't pretend you love these parts of it.  These are fixable problems if there is the community will to have them fixed.  If you don't think over a thousand hours is a long time to play a game, I think you have an addiction.  I am an avid gamer, but there has to be bounderies on what is reasonable to expect your players to do in order to progress.   Hope they fix it",0

A note for everyone first getting this game. Don't quit early if you're not doing so well. This game has a strict learning curve, with no guide (barely), no assistance in terms of skill placement, coaching is dead. You're basically free to go floating around where you'd like. I'd reccommend starting with Soldier, your general Jack of all Trades. Learn to rocket jump and get around the map.

9682,Star Trek Online,2014.0,I am a huge trekie or treker as some choose to call us.  Fans of Star Trek should not waste time with this game.

17687,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI had such high hopes for this game... but these developers are utterly incompetent, greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that don't care about your gaming experience. I don't think I've ever witnessed them fix anything in this game, rather any issue persists as long as it takes for them to completely replace it with something else usually worse. Really, I've tried, I can't think of any. The building aspect was amazing when I started playing about two years ago, it actually mattered where you put your blocks and how well you protected your pilot seat, the ability to actually engineer a robot is now virtually non-existent without any kind of pilot seat/control module. Gameplay used to be a competitive and rewarding teamplay experience, now that you get auto-heals and auto-lock missiles, there's no incentive for anyone to protect, heal, or support anyone else. They've nerfed any competetive aspect over and over to the point where pretty much whoever arrives or fires first will probably win. If you're down a teammate, which happens a looot as there is no way to reconnect to a match, you pretty much have no control over how screwed you are.It'd make your head hurt trying to understand all the ways they've accidentally succeeded in disallowing me to play with my brothers, alienating their users, and going against their own core concepts. I really don't know how to condense the book that I can write about all the good and bad in this game, but as the good seems to be gone and the bad is now worse, I'll just highlight a couple things that have either amused or ticked me off over the years:There was a ""rectifier"" that would pulse energy to flip you over if you ended up on your back, it was pretty cool this was taken away and we were given a 10 second auto-flip that lifts you up into the air and surrounds you in a swirly light that's like a billboard for the enemy team. Instead of knowing my own robot for how I built it and using my rectifiers as a tool, I now avoid ending up on my back only because of this new punishment they've forced on all of us or just let it go as a death if I do. This was maybe one of my favorite items in game, but I'm sure simple players were complaining about them being shot off (duh, protect them) or not working correcly after your robot is half destroyed (duh, place them better). This is a prime example of how they cater to the lowest common denomination of lazy, unskilled players, and then needlessly take from the rest of us to keep things in line with their idea of fair.At one point, they implemented multiple servers to be able to handle more users, but rather than letting each one handle users as it filled up, they simply divided up all the players equally amongst the servers. Guess what? Each server was starved for users and queue times instantly went up from only a few seconds to regularly over a half hour to an hour just to play a single match. This persisted for the better part of a year, meanwhile they seemed entirely clueless or unwilling to fix what they caused while regurgitating over and over that they just needed more players. ...Then, as it was finally getting better, they did it again! It just goes to show, whether they understood their mistake or not, they don't care what you have to go through. Seriously, from just a couple of seconds (it was incredible) to over 30 minutes on average, for over a year and they did nothing.There is this beep that lets you know when a platoon member is ready to battle, it seemed to work until after a patch, then once the beep started it didn't stop. It was useful at first, but then just frustrating, and they never fixed it...Each garage got a ""X2"" bonus for the first win of the day, they moved the ""X2"" to the garage icon and to the outer edge of the garage floor, but it also never went away. It was useful at first, but then just frustrating, and they never fixed it...Yet more issues that persisted for a year or so before just being removed entirely. Yep, that's right, no X2 bonus anymore because linking a graphic to a script was waaay to big of a job for them to handle (and wouldn't directly make them any money).This game has made me want to swear off early access games, but given that Freejam expects you will pay $20-$40 for one crappy robot and then shows no concern for any issues you might have, I really think it's just the people working on it that are the problem. I can't be mad at Robocraft, it used to be amazing, but the developers have ruined it to a point that I find unplayable. I'm more sad for the game, like when you see a smart kid unable to shine under an obliviously ignorant parent. Their vision seems to have gone from building an awesome game that nobody else hase, to blatantly copying other games in the hopes it will magically make them money. I mean, loot crates? Seriously? It might not be so bad if they hadn't also at the same time taken away the in-game currency that I paid for, but it's still pretty bad because I have no need for anything the crates give me. Screw you jerks, I want my money back!Oh, and megabots, I'm so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You have no idea how many hours I've spent building my mega, and now they're just gone. I'm really looking forward to hearing your reason for this one, Freejam, because all the problems you remove rather than fix always seem to be your own fault in the first place. These guys obviously can't manage their own code, but I'm pretty confident that they can't write it either and that they are paying someone else to do it. So we pay them, to pay themselves, to pay someone else to do their work, and that someone else for sure cares less about us players than Freejam does. To be completely fair, every time they take something away from me (pretty much every patch), I try to look at it like a whole new game. So then the game isn't as great as it was, but is still a pretty good game in itself at that point, then it's just good, then just okay, then disappointing, then more disappointing, now it's just bad.",0

11309,GUNS UP!,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewA lot of people describe this game as:""Fun but pay to win."" and I agree. It can be fun, for as long as you actually get matched against someone you CAN beat. In this review I will cover a few points that I consider important. Keep in my this review will be long, and to be honest is more of a rant about the game than an actual review.Matchmaking:It first started out nice, decent challange, some rounds you win, some you lose, but after a few hours it all changed.I came to a point where matchmaking gave me targets that are I either steamroll or they have more than twice my basepower, four times more base defense cards than I have, maxed out perks and heroes defending their base....Now why is this such a huge problem? Well because I dislike roflstomping my opposition or fighting something that I shouldn't even be able to be matched against yet. It seems that the matchmaking mostly goes by win/loss ration, that means if someone throws their wallet at the screen but does not play much you will be matched against them sooner or later. The game doesn't care that they get more units from their defense cards than you can actually deploy during a match(or that they have twice as many defense buildings and building levels than you).AI:I have seen flies that bump into an open window that I consider smarter than the AI in the game. I have to admit making AI is not easy, but this is not excusable, troops going forward only to bump into a wall and go all the way back to try a new route...One would think that when you deploy a squad that the squad will try to stick together, but nope.Also there have been a couple of hilarious bugs including a wall that completely blocks the way and troops just going back and forth(probably just trying to outlast the wall or something).Or a truck gunner not wanting to shoot because tea time or something.Attacking:So when attacking you get to choose between a few targets, you get to see what units they are using, what defense cards they have, how many of each structure they have and possible loot.This is a really good system, the only bad thing about it is the fact that you don't know the exact layout of the base, this is both good(element of suprise for your attacker) and bad(you don't know what attack cards do you use).The only complaint I have about this system is that it DOES NOT show you all units the enemy is using unless you click a button to get more info, so more than once I was suprised by a minigun troop ready to mow down my poor grunts. There is an option to repeat an attack on the base(for premium currency ofc.), and since I never used it I don't know if you can actually repick your cards, but if you can that is really OP.Cards:Cards are what makes every attack special and are split into 2 categories, defense and offense.Attack cards either buff your units in some way, debuff the enemy, or give you extra abilities at the start of the round, by default you get 3 ability cards at the start of the round. Some of them are really good against units, some against buildings.Major issue is you never know what cards you need to have to counter the base. You can pick from 0-5 cards at the start of the attack depending on your level(or if you pay you can have all 5 from start).The cards you pick are burned and you can't use them ever again, even if you don't actually use them.Defense cards give you extra units(some really OP in lower levels of play) while defending or give your base ability to cast its own version of attack cards when you get attacked. These things are rare, REALLY rare. They are very powerful and having 1 good troop card in your base is more than enough to beat most attackers that are your level or lower. These cards are not used when you get attacked.And to make things even tastier you can throw your wallet at the screen and pray to RNGesus in hope of getting something good, and it probably is since you can buy packs that actually contain something other than common cards with gold(the premium currency).Premium currency:Gold... This game perfectly shows how it is not  an army or strategy that wins the war, money wins wars... You need more buildings? You need more units? You want to be able to use more units? You want your units to be stronger than your foes? You want to use 5 attack cards at tiers that 1 ability can destroy a defense structure and the enemy has 3 defense buildings? You want heroes? Cash out fool!But really, each and every thing that I just named you can get by just playing the game long enough and cash does not only speeds up, it skips the whole process.Now is paying to skip progress bad?To be honest no, the major issue is the fact that matchmaking is dumb and does not understand that having more cards gives you more of an advantage in defense/offense than your W/L ratio...Crates:Oh boy more boxes to open! You can open them for free by getting random drops of keys that are quite rare, I have been playing for a month now and I think I only got 15 of them. You may think: ""Oh cool 15 keys, that is 15 boxes right?"" and at this point the game sadistically laughs because someone decided to put 25 locks on the only useful chest in the game. You can also throw your money at the screen and open it immediately.But hey, atleast chests are common reward, so one would hope to stockpile them if they ever decide to open them later. Ooooh noooo, you can't stockpile crates, you have to destroy them. And what magical items you get for scrapping chests? 1k-5k ingame currency(depending on the chest) if I am not wrong, compared to how much you could get from an actualy ingame currency card that is nothing.That there is a slap in the face.Summary:Fun game plagued by a horrible matchmaking and pay to skip features that tripped over the pay to win line.Perhaps one day they change the matchmaking so you actually get matched against people that are not able to deploy more units in defense than you in offense? Perhaps... I would be happy if they did that, I could change this review to positive like I initially inteded to give this game.Pros:-fun and addictive gameplay-many units to use-every unit feels like it has a place somewhere-F2P-card mechanic is really fun to use-pretty visuals/good audioCons:-AI derps out quite often-P2W-horribly optimised(game seems to be rendering the level during loading/end game screens or any overlay...)-matchmaking is horrible-at times feels like a mobile game with  ""buy the premium"" messages and offers poping up left and right ",0

If you play CSGO, Combat Arms, AVA, Point Blank, Project blackout, Soldier Front and pretty much any F2P Shooter game, this game is worth the try!!

Some players insist on not fighting and just squatting or dancing around the map, calling themselves ""friendlies"" and getting mad if you kill them. They disadvantage their team by taking up player slots that could be filled with contributing players, and are a general nuisance.Also, on a particular map, Hightower, players will sometimes tell you not to complete the map objective, desiring instead to run around aimlessly and kill people without end. If you try to complete the objective anyway, you will either receive little help, get cussed at, or kicked fro mthe lobby.Thankfully, these types of plyers are the exception, and while they do subtract from the fun, they are not in great enough numbers to ruin it. I've met many nice people playing this game, and made some good friends along the way.Competitive mode is fun, but suffers from hackers, because you cannot kick players from the lobbies. Ocassionally, they will be banned but thsi does take time.What is worse is, since few players play competitive, it can take a very long time to get into a game. It has taken me over 40 minutes, and sometiems I can't even get into a match. And what is worse is these are not isolated incidents, they occur consistently.Man Vs. Machine mode is very fun. It is enjoyable to play and fight waves of invading robots, but can get a little tedious with time if you don't take a breakfrom it after awhile.Community servers vary, but are often fun for a little whileHere is a checklist of stuff you should try:-Complete all the achievements (520 of them!)-Get to Rank 150 in Casual mode-Get to Rank 13 in Competitive mode (if you can't get into a game)-Do one Tour of Duty each for all available tours-Explore all the different community servers.I hope this review helps!

15337,Path of Exile,2016.0,"In my opinion it's the best Action RPG that's on the market right now. It has a grim setting, and a story that's mostly told through environmental bits of lore, but most importantly it has a depth of gameplay that no other ARPG comes even close to. It's the best spiritual successor to Diablo II to date. The first time you open the passive skill tree you are likely to be overwhelmed. There is a web with hundreds of choices. Don't worry, eventually it will make sense. You can obtain respect points via quests and item drops, so you can not mess anything up permanently anyway.Your active skills are acquired by putting skill gems into sockets on your gear. The gems have one of three colours (red/blue/green), that match with the colour of the sockets on your gear. Sockets can be linked, allowing you to attach support gems to your active skill gems. This can do things such as splitting your Burning Arrow into 4 projectiles, or turning your Glacial Hammer attack into an AoE attack that hurts monsters all around you. Later in the game, you can even find support gems that can trigger active skill gems automatically once you take enough damage, or get stunned.Every three months the devs launch a major patch with a new challenge league, which adds new skills, new game mechanics and challenges which offers new loot rewards and cosmetics.The free to play model is truly free to play. You can play all the content in the game without paying a dime. The only way the game developers make money is by offering microtransactions in their store, for cosmetic upgrades that don't affect gameplay. Want your mismatched set of gear to have a unified look? Maybe shop for a set of cosmetic armor looks. Want your fireball to look like a dragon, there is a microtransaction for that! Want a lizard with a bell on it's back to follow you around like a puppy? There's a microtransaction for that!I have put hundreds of hours into the game (using their native client because I started playing before the game was on Steam) and found buying the microtransactions to be a good way to support the developers so they can continue to add more (and more and more and more) content to the game, while also making my characters look awesome via the cosmetic microtransactions.There are a few non-cosmetic microtransactions available, to upgrade your account with more character slots (I believe the default is 12, so that is enough to create at least one character of each of the 7 classes) and to get more shared stash tabs to hoard all the items you find and share them between your characters. The default you get is 4, which people are starting to argue was enough when the game launched in 2013, but is a little cramped for all the content we have now in 2016. There are also ""premium"" stash tabs that allow you to rename the stash tabs and give their labels colours.The game is free, so why are you reading this review instead of playing the game?",1

4516,AdventureQuest 3D,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAs it says, this is an Early Access Review. In other words, the game will improve over time. If you don't wish to play the game when it's incomplete, you aren't suitable for Beta Testing or any testing for that matter. Stay away from this currently incomplete game. (You have been warned).Just like every other AE game, this has the same concept. Farming. It's extremely grindy, like seriously. If you hate any form of grinding or TOO MUCH grinding, then stay away as well.There are new features such as crafting and now even the Pumpkin Lord Armour is farmable. Which is a great step forward for non-p2p players. In other words, it is more farmy and less cashy. Just like how an AE game should be.For anyone that complained that the PumpkinLord armour is too hard to farm due to low levels joining in the dungeon, they have capped it and is now much more easy.A new area has been released and guess what? More farming! Before anyone starts complaining that the hard area is too hard, it's probably because you're too low level. (Basically a newbie. NOT AN INSULT HERE.)I take back my previous statement about levels being less important though. They are super important because the best armour currently available in game is level 15.If you're new to AE games, I really don't recommend this because the story DOES NOT FLOW. Yes. AE games are made in such a way that if you never played any other games made by them, the story will feel very weird and rushed. As a long time player of ALL their games, I can say that their lore is extremely deep. For example, the plot twist about Artix and Gravelyn actually makes sense. If you looked back at their past storyline, you'll actually see why. Sepulchure's backstory is personally my favourite (And the way he died T^T)Basically, if you want to start on this game, PLAY ALL OF ITS PREQUELS.If you wish to just jump into this game without any knowledge of how AE games work, you will have a 50% chance of either loving it, or hating it.",1

18670,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"I started playing this and luckily I ran into the poor design and customer support before I spent more than 10 euro on this game. It is a good game for collectors but severely, severely grindy. It's not just killing mobs over and over, but in order to complete collections some of the mobs have normal drop rates for grinders, about 0.1% but the problem is that the mob may only have 2 spawn ever 5 min. So not only do you have to kill 100's of the mob, but you have to spend an enormous amount of time doing so. Better to have many spawns with a lower drop rate.But the real killer is the poor game design about some things. You can enchance your weapon in player shops, but to do so, you have to unequip it. If you forget to re-equip it and it gets sold to an NPC, good bye item. There is no buy back feature and if you ask for support, they don't even have a ""this is your one get out of jail free card"". Yes, this is what happened to me, I accidentally sold my weapon that I'd spent days grinding for. So good thing it happened to me early in the game so I know not to waste more time on a game that not only has poor design but also lacks customer support.It's not all bad though, they occationally clean out the bots and the spammers. The graphics are nice and the controls refreshingly simple. The classes are highly varied so you can design as you like, but as usual when there's a lot of class choices, only a few become really viable.If they would fix some of the design flaws or improve customer service, I could recommend this game, but in it's current state, I cannot do so.",0
17599,Realm Royale,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewVery Fun already better than fortnite since peopple can't spam build way to protect themselves i like the fact that you accually WEAR armor instead of drinking potions and each class has weapons and armor so a warrior cant wear mage armor which in my opinion balances it out for people who have a hard time finding gear.

This game, however, is pretty good and fun to play, especially if you have a friend or two to create party with and explore the world together. Lore is quite interesting and both systems and interface are designed very well.

3633,VEGA Conflict,2018.0,"game is allright, its somewhat like clash of clans, except its in space and 80% of the time your raiding cargo ships for resources, and only every now and then raiding other peoples bases. Wish there was a trade option for factions other than just a help option that drops time on your build or upgrade process by like 2% maybe. Anyway other than that its a allright game. nice building and refining for your base part makes you have to be somewhat active in it since astroids that spawn around your base actually run out and you have to move your mineral and Helium mining stations to make credits. Also another thing that sucks about the game is if your in a faction you cant see what your teammates base has or help there fleets in battle which to me kinda sucks. other than that I give this game a 2/5.

1620,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe best bits of MTG and Hearthstone with (almost) all the bad removed.    Infinitely cheaper than MTG, with a way more generous F2P model giving it an edge over hearthstone as well.   The 5-colour mana system allows a wider range of decks and more deck-tuning options than hearthstone's rigid class-based system.    The problems of mana flood/screw which plague MTG have been minimized by the way the game forces a certain number of power cards (lands) in your starting hand.  Health returning to full at the end of turns (like in MTG) in addition to the fact that the defending player chooses how blockers are assigned in combat, destroys the ""Curvestone"" problem of brainless ""1 drop, 2 drop, 3 drop"" decks being overwhelmingly effective. The basic game mechanics encourage and reward slower decks with more interesting decisions!  Being developed by a great team including Legendary MTG pro-player Luis Scott-Vargas  The bad  As it currently stands, the game doesn't explain some of the more intricate interactions very well, and kind of assumes a certain level of MTG knowledge. For example, if you try chump blocking a creature with overwhelm (AKA trample in MTG) and deadly (AKA Deathtouch), you might be surprised when your 4 health defender only blocks one of the damage and the rest hits you. You can certainly play this game never having touched MTG, but you might run into a few moments like these that might feel unfair.   The starting campaign was a bit of a slog to get through for new players, and didn't really do the job of a tutorial in that it didn't teach about the kind of interactions mentioned above. HOWEVER, the introduction campaign has just been reworked and seems to be much more engaging now.  If you have ever had even a passing interest in MTG or Hearthstone, you should try out Eternal. Most of the problems that have turned people I know away from other CCGs have been put to rest in this game. ",1

19485,Champions Online,2011.0,"My favorite MMORPG so far, Champions Online has a wonderful action oriented combat system with crunchy character bulding, stat management and power selection systems that allow a detailed player to build something extra potent! ""Be the Hero you want to be!""CO also has a wonderful Free to Play option that takes out about 90% of that complexity and thus serving as an excellent hand holding introduction to the funnest elements of the gameplay without the harder stat managing aspects, which some players such as myself love, but some don't. It's definitely easier to learn the basics of the game with.An adaptation of the Tabletop RPG Champions, Champions Online is a 2009 Super Hero MMORPG offering a wide variety of power and costume customisation options. While the storylines and environments are usually an Homage to a Silver Age style, light-hearted and brightly-coloured, occasional Bronze Age consequences and morals are hinted at. Player characters display a wide range of styles, from The Cape through The Cowl to the Nineties Anti-Hero.Various departures from the Pen & Paper game are noticeable, including the absence of the concept of acquiring character flaws in order to gain extra points. However, there is a lot more power growth compared to the Pen and Paper experience.The intellectual property rights to the Champions setting are now held by Cryptic Studios (themselves owned by Perfect World Entertainment), the original developers of the MMORPG City of Heroes. They bought the setting outright rather than licensing it. The IP is licensed back to the original developers (who still own the underlying Hero System) for the Champions pen-and-paper game.As a Superhero MMO with a sense of humour about itself, there are numerous references to other works. It features just about everything on the list of comic book tropes.As of January 2011 it is free to play, downloadable from its website; later in June it came to Steam along with a few other such games. Another fairly notable update came in the form of ""On Alert"" in April of 2012, which changed the logo, made more content available to everybody (and with it added more premium content) and added the titular alert system. The alert system is effectively a new type of mission, and one of several ways to gain the resource questionite, which can be used directly to buy some things, or traded player-to-player in an stock exchange type system for the cash store's currency, at this point Perfect World's ZEN.(In addition, several missions and bosses which were already present were edited to reward questioniteâ€”including the adventure packs, which as of that update became free for all.) In late 2012, vehicles were introduced, becoming a customizable feature in December with the Reloaded update.",1
167,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"While the prospect of getting more Elder Scrolls lore while waiting on the next mainline game to come out may seem attractive, Legends is not worth the hassle. It's a Hearthstone clone, more or less. Pleagued by the same RNG and money-grabbing issues thatp lague ALL CCGs. Every element of the game is rigged to extort money from you. If you want a remotely competitive deck, as with all CCGs, be prepared to blow $100 on card packs so you can RNG the cards you need or get the dust you need to craft them. The non-paid content will last you a few hours at most, and then the game will begin demanding money for a few more hours, which will be depleted after you chew through it because they only have a few content packs out now. All of which are hideously overpriced because the people who DO spend money on CCGs buy the packs 40 at a time. Because as psychological research has shown us, CCGs and other microtransaction schemes are tailored to prey on ""whales"". People with compulsive personality disorders or poor impulse control who cannot resist the urge to see what comes out of that next pack, or what card comes off the top of their deck next. They're biologically predisposed to take risks, minimize losses, overstate their gains, and keep pulling any lever or pushing any button that makes pleasant noises or flashes pretty lights at them. Game devs know this, so they make their games to milk these ""whales"" for their money. Legends is no different.Beyond the hideously exploitative pricing model, the game itself is the usual RNG garbage that all CCGs are. You can be mopping the floor with someone and be up 20hp one turn, then the next they luck into a card combo that wins them the game. Likewise, you can be struggling all game against someone and then RNG hands you the perfect cards to turn the game around while stiffing your opponent. There's very little personal skill or tactical thinking involved. The personal skill element boils down to making a balanced deck and making wise trades in the games.That's maybe 30% of what determines who wins and who loses. Another 10% is probably the rock-paper-scissors game design philosophy that plays out like: Decks that spawn lots of small enemies lose to decks that spawn big enemies lose to decks with a lot removal/lethality lose to decks with lots of small enemies. The other 60% is all luck. Plain, boring, dumb luck.I can't recommend this or any other CCG. Ever. If you love these games, seek help instead. There are treatments for gambling addiction.",0

4365,Dungeon Defenders II,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI normally stay away from doing reviews, but honestly the community who want to dog this game is absurd. The game is still in Early Access. Now sure we are going on almost 2 years (in a few months), but there are plenty of other games that have done the same. People complain about Microtransactions, people complain that they can't just buy the game, people complain that and this and bah. Skins can cost however much they want, you don't have to buy them. The heros don't have to be bought. Sure it takes awhile to earn them I have put 150 hours into the game most of which was before they even had defender medals. So, I have just now earned One of the Heroes and I barely put time into it People are complaining that they are putting out new content. I have never in all my years heard of people complain because they are getting new stuff. ""It costs too much"" Then don't buy it ""It takes to long to get"" Then don't get it. This isn't a Moba where they are going to release 60+ Heroes. They are not going to just give away what they are spending their time making without making you earn it. They are even nice enough to make it so the costs goes down after a week of the new Hero coming out. Which they have no real reason to do. (Though I admit that it costing the exact cap is kinda annoying as it means you have to stop if you get there and the hero hasn't came out yet but I digress)  ",1

13713,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI started playing this a few days ago. As a new player, I have observed that a lot of matches are one-sided stompfests. If you don't spend real life money to load up on epic or legendary items, then prepare to get your robot stomped into the ground over and over again every match. A waste of time unless you're willing to drop cash to roll for epic/legendary items before ever setting foot in a match.Edit: After putting more hours into the game, I find the gameplay to be flawed. Every map is filled with close quarters and objects to hide behind, so long range weaponry is useless on most maps. This compounds the problem with the game I mentioned earlier; not only do you need legendary or epic items to succeed, but you need specifically short-ranged ones. It is poor game design to have over half of the most expensive weapons in the game be rendered useless by the design of the maps.",0

1450,War Thunder,2014.0,"UPDATED 6/1/14UPDATED AGAIN 5/4/18War Thunder sounds great on paper, but the gameplay in this game is total garbage. The combat is awful. Since 95% of players will likely just play in arcade mode, if you get someone tailing you - you're done. I've tried every move in the air combat book and nothing works. This makes this the most infuriating game to play, because you can't escape a plane behind you. You literally need someone else to shoot them, and good luck getting help from random players.The controls are also terrible. I don't know what sick joke people play by telling people mouse mode is good, but it's awful. You don't have a direct feel for how much you're banking at any given moment and it's very difficult to get the reticle to line up for a lead shot. Most games you'll just spend your time circling an enemy, or if you try for a head on engagement you'll likely be rammed as death by plane collision is extremely common and some try to do it on purpose (Take out a bomber which is hard to shoot down by ramming it). The playerbase is not very helpful, and no one really helps out. You're most likely to be greeted with ""lol l2plane"" verbatim if you ask questions.The Realistic and Simulator modes resolve some of these issues, but the game controls still feel bad in mouse mode. My joystick hasn't arrived yet, but based on comments from many in the community mouse mode is easier than joystick mode so I doubt honestly it will get much better with a joystick. There are far less players in the realistic and simulator modes as well.Balancing is also an issue. There are some entire nations which perform far below others. Most players would say to play Russian and British planes and avoid Axis planes because they're not too good. At the starter tier, the Chaika a soviet plane is the most decried overpowered plane in the game. A high turn rate, biplane which fires 4 deadly cannons at a very rapid rate which can quickly take out the other planes at the tier and even many that are higher than it. Matchmaking will suddenly ramp the difficulty up for you significantly and start introducing you to many bombers and fighters as well as many strong ground targets which need large bombs to take out. At this point, you have nothing but light guns to shoot at ground targets and light bombs. This means you'll be forced to slug it out with the stronger planes, which you will likely lose to since they have superior guns. The overall process of getting to your next plane is very painful and doesn't feel well implemented. There are many things you can research, but the game presents them in a haphazard way that doesn't make much sense. Some tier 1 planes can't be researched, but then others can and after a random other plane is researched then a new one can be researched that is in no way related. The game's research tree is confusing, as much of the rest of the game is even to someone who knows what to look for.I spent a fair amount of time trying to give this game a chance, and it's just the most frustrating game experience I've had. Wouldn't recommend at all. If you're looking at this compared to Wargaming's games, this is way more pay to win model as you don't get any free XP (RP in this game) and with the premium currency you could easily skip up to a higher tier plane. I have played maybe 50-75 matches and I have 50k free RP that if I spent premium currency on I could unlock probably a tier 3 plane (The game has 5 tiers with multiple planes within the same tier). This game strongly rewards those who spend money, far more than a Wargaming game and it will likely prove frustrating for a player that's not hardcore into air combat and is honestly not that satisfying for someone who is interested in air combat given realistic and simulator modes are the modes you would want to always choose. A sidenote about those modes too, the matches are very long. The timer for realistic matches (More realistic than arcade but not as hardcore as simulator) is 60 minutes, to the generally 15-25 minute timer for arcade matches. The arcade mode to me just feels very off, and the difficulty curve into the realistic mode is much higher which makes it more difficult to grind for your next plane.UPDATESo I've heard about the ground combat. I decided to try it out and see if that was any better, of course World of Tanks is the first thing to compare it to. You start out in a lowly tank with a weak gun, but you face similar tanks and all is fairly fun. Arcade mode numbs down the difficulty a bit too much since you can immediately see where the enemy tanks are even if they're in heavy cover. Realistic mode is a bit too punishing though. Unfortunately if you're moderately decent at all, you get up-tiered because of your skill level very quickly and then you'll be facing off against tanks you can't hurt. So you'll find yourself cornered on maps, with no teammates (team work in this game is somehow even more non-existant than World of Tanks, likely due to the large maps and spread out goals). Often times flanking the enemy tank and shooting the rear doesn't even work. After a dozen matches of losing and being wiped out, with minimal XP gains, I just gave up again. You also get to worry about planes bombing you at any moment, as if the overpowered tanks you can't hurt aren't enough.Gaijin is never going to improve this game, clearly they've decided they want their game to be this ""realistic"" game that they won't back down from. Once again, realistic mode is far more sparsely populated than arcade though - and I think this is a huge mistake. Arcade mode is basically what World of Tanks is, though it has more enjoyable gameplay. War Thunder's ground combat is sloppy and feels like a mess. This game is a pretty big download and an even bigger disappointment for all the hype it receives. If you want ground combat, stick to World of Tanks (though I can't honestly recommend that anymore, teamplay is so awful there that matches are rarely fun anymore). We're sorely lacking a good game in this space now, but the choices are to make do with Gaijin and Wargaming's very mediocre games or do without. Frankly, I'd rather do without - these are just exercises in frustration and time wasting.5/4/18 Update:So the plane combat is still awful. Tank combat felt a little better than before, but the entire way this game plays is awful. I stopped playing World of Tanks a few years ago due to decline in its quality but looks like War Thunder is dying off and is doing much worse. Don't waste your time on this game, there is just nothing of value gained from it. I feel ripped off of the time I wasted on this even for free.",0
11614,Star Trek Online,2014.0,"Alright. Not going to lie...I'm a bit of a geek when it comes to Star Trek.  This MMO continues to surprise me. Namely, I started playing it when it first launched (and it was a subscription based MMO). Cryptic did a good job, but to be honest, they launched it too early, and it felt like it was halfway done.  The Federation side had a good amount of content, but the Klingon faction, did not.  So after playing it for about a year, I took a break from it (a year plus break).  Coming back to it after so long, even after it went F2P and Cryptic was bought by Perfect World Entertainment, I must say, Cryptic has done an excellent job in expanding the universe.  Not only did they launch a third faction, the Romulans, they also fully fleshed out the Klingon faction.  They also updated the trait system, kit system, and R&D system, while continuing to create Featured Episodes.  That, along with a more robust Foundry (a system that let's the community create playable missions to share), I must say, I've gotten hooked on this game once again.",1

14946,Paladins®,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game does heavily borrow a TON of gameplay elments and ideas from Overwatch, but this game has been in development since 2010, so we don't know who borrowed from who really. I enjoyed Overwatch and it's characters, but it was just missing that ""umph"". Though when I tried out this game, I also had enjoyed the game as well, but here's the difference: I play this game much longer than I ever did for Overwatch. Infact if people say this game is a clone of Overwatch, then I say this game is the original and Overwatch is the clone. Paladins provides a more indepth gameplay than Overwatch, because Overwatch appeals more over to casuals, it's gameplay is just plain simple. Paladins is fluid, provides more tech, skill with it's level system, and cards for much more different playstyles for all SEVENTEEN+ classes. That's alot. The character designs are much more spreaded out from a fennec to dragon, to turtle to Tree monster instead of having mostly a human cast(Overwatch), which make things very interesting and original in my book. I'm actually suprised because the cast in Paladins seems more of the cast Blizzard would dish out.Paladins does not have a backstory as of yet of course because it's in beta, but I'm sure me and many others look forward to one very soon. The characters in this game keeps you guessing becuase they are that mysterious and interesting.  I'm at the point of thinking Overwatch is only big because of it's publisher and not what the game really is. If Blizzard made Paladins, it would get as much recognition as it does now for Overwatch.I honeslty rather have this game TRUMP Overwatch, and look foward to investing more of my time and maybe even my MONEY into this game!",1

3382,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,"The usual reason to play WoT Blitz is to speed up waiting - be it on the Porcelain Throne, on a bus or in a queue. Now I can add 'just for the heck of it (without using BlueStacks)' to my list.After 826 battles, I've unlocked:Chi-Nu, Japanese Tier 5 medium tank,AT-2, British Tier 5 tank destroyer,SU-85, Soviet Tier 5 tank destroyer,KV-1S, Soviet Tier 6 heavy tank,Leopard, German Tier 5 light tank.I was initially very impressed by others bouncing dozens of shots off the armor of the KV-1 and decided I must also have it. The Soviet heavy tree has been a boring grind for the most part though with the only exception of the T-46 (tier 3). The KVs are very slow and virtually blind. It's a lottery if you'll manage to position yourself for a few hard-hitting shots and absorbing a good amount of damage or you'll get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from behind by a Leopard within the first 2 minutes. The KV-1S was incredibly weak until I got the best gun for it (costing 20k experience), but even now it reloads so slow that a single miss can mean I'm more of a burden than a boon to my team.The British AT-2 is the closest you get to cheating in this game. In a battle where you're the highest tier and you manage to keep enemies off your♥♥♥♥♥and shooting at your front you'll quickly ruin the other team's game. It has 203 mm of frontal armor, which would be good at tier 7 (you're tier 5). You're going to sacrifice speed (it's really-really slow) and view range, so you kind of still depend on your team to scout baddies out for you, but this is probably the easiest tank to steal the show with by shrugging off thousands of points of damage and destroying most of the enemy team.The Soviet TD line has been pretty much okay all-around. SU-85 has a nice low profile for hiding behind rocks and hopefully making the enemy aim a bit too high and miss.German light tanks require skill. A masterful Leopard can punch much higher than it's weight, but it's also really easy to speed into a group of enemies and get killed within 30 seconds of the start of the battle. It's an okay tree to unlock, but nothing that exhilirating. German TDs are quite enjoyable, especially the Hetzer with it's small frame and very well angled armor plates for bouncing off shots even if you do get spotted.Surprisingly the Japanese tech line has been by far the most fun for me. I chose the light branch (Ha-Go, Ke-Ni, Ke-Ho) winning 62, 61 and 50 % of the battles respectively, being 'productive' in each battle. The tier 5 Chi-Nu is on the useless side starting out but also quite good when fully upgraded. What made the light Japanese tanks so fun was that I could reach any mountaintop, their small size (all stats being equal, a smaller tank is better) made almost any bush viable for total camoflague and guns with high maximum depression angles and fast reload times enabled me to keep shooting almost every second of the battle. Shooting opponents is the fun part of WoT Blitz and the Jap tanks offered lots and lots of this.I think it generally holds true that the higher level you play at, the more boring it gets. At Tier 6+ everyone's pretty much a veteran, knows all the sweet spots on the map and punishes any mistake you make harshly. Battles where you can kill 3-6 tanks on the enemy team via sniping cleverly are pretty much behind you by then. So I think it's fair to recommend playing multiple low level tanks instead of focusing hard on one.Why I generally like WoT Blitz:1) Best time killer app I know - kills lots of it without getting boring, difficult or whatever, effectively a time machine when waiting at the dentist's for example2) Very short match queues - I don't want to queue while I queue3) Progressing through tiers of tanks feels good4) At least for now, no-one cheats, almost no-one pays to win5) I get to learn tank names6) A lot less of a cl*sterf*ck than the original WoT for desktop",1

Not only are they expensive at times, but you can open up about 100 of them and still get garbage.",0
7719,World of Warships,2017.0,"This game is a straight up RNG engine. You need to have some skill to participate in that engine, i.e. if you're not good you won't get the chance to get lucky or unlucky with shots at all and you'll simply miss, but even when you figure out ranging, leading, etc. you'll often find two shots from the same cannon drifting above AND below the target at the SAME TIME! Entire broadsides fired together will somehow fall inches from the target on every side without touching it. And sometimes every shot will hit. Totally up to the drift RNG. But even better, particular locations on the ship are critical hits (called the citadel) if you penetrate the armor. Taking the drift into account, you can aim for them, but outside close range it is, of course, relatively random whether you hit this spot or not. Whether you penetrate the armor or not is, you guessed it, more RNG. But what makes this REALLY great is on top of all that, if it DOES hit the citadel, and if it DOES penetrate the armor, the damage is utterly catastrophic, taking off up to 50% of your health per shell. Not a battleship shell to a destroyer. A battleship shell to a battleship. Same weight class. 50%. Gone. Just like that. Completely. At. Random.But what's even MORE fun? On top of all that, there is a tiny, tiny percentage chance that any given shot will hit your magazine. So more RNG for more massive damage.The practical upshot of all this is while there is a significant amount of skill involved, and the chances of it happening to you at any given time are low, you can (and do) intermittently just explode for no reason. You can be winning a duel by a LOT and then a lucky, single shell, fired as a parting shot from a fleeing foe with a broken rudder and a burning deck, will completely obliterate you.So to be completely fair, that doesn't happen much. But it does happen, and when it does it's pretty much the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ever. Basic citadel hits, which are far more common, are still pretty obnoxious, as there's little you can do about them.So basically, skill is involved, but not really the ultimate deciding factor. If you enjoy randomly exploding, play this game. If you don't... Well, if you're really into ships then give it a try for the good looking models and see for yourself. But if you're not into ships, just give it a pass. It's not a good enough game to reccomend to anybody who isn't a Pacific Theatre nerd. ",0
8316,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewWhen i began to play the game it was nice. Grinding to unlock new weapons and upgrades and sometimes even good teamwork. Even pay to win and the spawn killing tanks did not bother me too much.I played this game for 249 hours so i have seen many changes in the game some good some bad.I like to play with the bolt action rifles and i had unlock the sniper rifle i just needed 10000 credits to buy it.But after the last big patch ( 7 july ) you can only get the sniper rifle if you are recon.You can unlock two 4x scopes for the bolt action rifle but it is at the end of the new bolt action ribbon.But what really annoyed me was the if you are moving the bolt action rifle will not fire you have to stop to shoot.And in this game movement is life so as a rifle men you will die constantly.So after two days of playing with the new patch i have come to the conclusion that they broke this game.If you like to use only SMG and LMG this game is for you.If there is an other great patch i will play it to see if they fixed it.But for me at this moment it is over, i'm done with this game.

1909,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016.0,"Until Valve come up with a better matchmaking method (with almost 4 years since the release, I'd say there are no such plans) you'll be better off wasting your time and emotional balance elsewhere. Competitive is crowded with smurfs, poisonous jerks, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who find it amusing to ruin their team's match on purpose, cheaters and kids. To be fair, kids are probably the most pleasant group to play with cause they mostly try to play well, even if they can't. If you play really, really well - you may be able to ignore the first 2 groups. The rest will still be there.My biggest complaint towards competitive gameplay is that reporting people doesn't do much, especially reporting for offensive voice / text chat - it's always been merely a placebo button. Global Offensive jokes aside, you cannot imagine how fed up I am with people losing their♥♥♥♥♥♥when I say I am Russian, even if I carry the game and never insult anyone or talk about politics.

The circuits are very well build and have a lively atmosphere around them which is in big contrast with the coolness of AssettoCorsa.. The big variety of cars each have their own charactheristics. From WTCC to DTM92, from Group 5 to prototypes, they are all very enjoyable if you succeed in taming them. Sounds are well, you automatically raise your volume..The community of raceroom is very open, fair and sportive but competitive at the same time.

Love it or leave it. That's their kind of trust to customers who have paid into this game...",0
15938,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"Played the game on Bethesda Launcher before it was released on Steam. Finished the free single player campaign but never player PvP.It felt like a mixture of Magic and Hearthstone. The deck construction is like magic where you can mix up to two classes of cards, while the battle system is like Hearthstone where magicka (like mana crystal in HS) grows up by 1 each turn and how attack works. There are also supports and items which are pretty much similar to the artifacts and equipment in Magic. Creature abilities are basically a sum of both games: summon (battle cry), guard (taunt), breakthrough(trample), last grasp (deathrattle), lethal(poison), drain(lifelink), pilfer, regenerate, etc.It does introduces something new in this game: Mainly the two lane system where each lane is its own battle ground, so you'll have to be more tactic about distributing your creature cards on the field. Also the special rules of each lane (stealth-like right lane and level-specific left lane) makes it worthwhile to consider which lane you want to lay down your card (In a way, it's a reinvention of Magic's flying creature mechanism). There's also the rune sytem which acts like secret from HS that let you draw 1 card when losing certain amount of health. There are cards that interact specifically with such mechanism. Second-go player are quite compensated with jewel rings that are like the extra coin in HS but you can use it three times.I have to agree with what others said about the balancing. I feel that the three uses of jewel for second-go is a bit too much, but at least it's not completely unplayable for first-go player. Also I'm not a hug fan of 50-card minimum requirement for deck construction. This makes it extremely hard for beginners to build decent decks that don't contain ""filler"" cards (which essentially lower your chance of draw combo cards).Overall, I still think this is definitely a game worth playing. You can play through a quite lengthy campaign for free and unlock others with in-game currency that you earn. There's even a solo Arena mode (like in HS) but you play against AI, great for PvE players like me. I think it finds a balance between the casual side of HS (simpler rules and faster pace) and the hardcore side of Magic (creature abilities, deck construction). It's a game you don't have to heavily invest your time in. You can simply pick up and leave any time when you have around 15min to spare, good for killing time. It would, however, be even better if it's brought to mobile device (which I think it's going to happen) for even better access to game.It's very light on hardware and friendly to touch-screen. I would simply keep the game installed so that you can play it while waiting for a class to begin or having a coffee at Starbucks. ",1
14281,Black Squad,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewLet me start off by saying that this game is actually very nice, it reminds me of the old Combat Arms and Crossfire kind of games. The weapons all seem balanced (except for things like the KSG, for what I've seen), the interface is nice and all in all this game looks and plays great.There is, however, one great negative thing about this game; the connection of most people. They seem to be working with global servers most of the time, instead of regional servers. This results in games with 50% of the people having a good-decent ping (i.e. 40-80 ping). The other 50% however has a ping of around 140-300. This makes the game so much more tedious to play. When I shoot someone through the head 5 times, I expect them to die, not to walk away like the bullets never hit him.So, my conclusion is that this game is quite good, especially for a F2P shooter. However, the people ruin it with their awful connections with which I personally can't play at all.",1
5843,AdventureQuest 3D,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewNow, I'm probably slightly biased because I played the original ""AdventureQuest"" and ""DragonFable"" back in the day, but I truly love this game.This game is built with a centeral focus on broad accessability, both in how easy the gameplay is to pick up on (seriously, even the most novice-level gamer can master the basics of the game's combat, movement, and questing in the first hour or two of play) and the mercifully low system requirements (Don't have a dedicated gaming rig with a top-of-the-line graphics card, a solid state drive, a 3.5 gigahertz quad core CPU, and a funky liquid cooling system? No problem! This game could run smoothly on a modest netbook!). The humor is goofy, light-hearted, and full of fun pop culture references; the art style is cartoonish and vibrantly colorful; and the overall atmosphere of the game is one of fun and joy, and you can't help but smile at the goofy monsters and silly puns. It's just easy enough to get into that it serves as a fun ""chill game"" for experienced gamers between more hardcore titles, but just challenging enough that young kids and more casual gamers will get a decent challenge out of it as they learn to play their class and climb up a difficulty curve that expects players to master the game's mechanics but doesn't slam them with insane difficulty spikes out of the blue. This balance between challenge and comfort makes AQ3D basically the gaming equivalent of in-shell roasted peanuts: Delicious and satisfying, with an acceptable level of challenge to get to the good part...and the ocasional bonus nut in the shell when you least expect it.If you, like me, played the older browser games back in the day, you will feel a rush of nostalgia when running into the old, familiar cast of NPC's and will really be amazed at the job the team at Artix Entertainment did when bringing the old 2D Flash world of Lore into the Third Dimension. Sure, the graphics aren't as shiny as ""Final Fantasy XIV"" or ""Black Desert Online"" on the highest settings (the game is meant to be playable on both PC and mobile devices...with the side-effect that it's easy on older and less powerful machines too), but there's a PS2-era charm to it that just feels natural for the AQ universe. The music and sound are decent, nothing to write home about, but pleasant to the ear and situationally fitting.Character customization is simplistic: Gender, Hair Style (including main style and braided side-locks), eye color, skin color, and starting class. You can't switch your character's body type (yet...*hint**weedle*), but you can switch their class and outer appearance in-game and their gender on their character page on the game's website. The three classes you can pick in the begining are Warrior, Mage, and Rogue, but with a one-time payment of $20 you can unlock the Guardian class (which includes the class, and unlocking a new area and special armor...just like the other games in the AQ family). This being an AQ game, you can pretty much expect that down the line you'll be able to turn your character into a werewolf or vampire, and the next level of classes (and dual-wielding for rogues) are already being tried out on the game's test server. Sadly, this game does not have multiple character slots available, though...so if you're going to re-create one of your old characters from an older AQ game or an original character of yours in AQ3D, make sure you choose your favorite.The combat in this game is simple Tab-targeting, and currently you're mostly stuck fighting one guy at a time...even if more than one guy is attacking you. They are working on AOE attack capabilities, though, so that's going to be fixed eventually. As simple as the combat is, though, it's also fun, engaging, and surprisingly tactical. Learning how to play your class is key to success and survival, and woe betide the player who drops their guard while fighting regular mobs a little too close to where an elite enemy either is or is likely to spawn. No-look this game and you WILL die. A lot.As far as the community is concerned, the population is pretty healthy. You see a lot of players online all over the place, and folks are pretty friendly in this game. I'm guessing it's because there are a lot of long-time and returning AQ and DF fans playing who are now in their 20's and 30's, and it's a relatively laid-back, non-competative game overall, which breeds a more friendly and colaborative atmosphere. There are plans for some kind of PvP in the game, however...so let's hope that it's implemented in such a way that it doesn't encourage gankers to prey on low-level players or turn certain areas of the game into ""bad neighborhoods"" where you can't go 5 minutes without some over-eager brawler just spoiling for a fight popping up to bother you with an impromptu and totally unwanted duel.(Sorry if I hurt some feelings with that, but I really don't care if your king-fu is better than mine. I'm just here to grind mobs, explore the world, and hunt for treasure. Some people see the possibility of random open world PvP as incredibly fun and exciting, I just see it as an annoying interruption...like the morning alarm clock going off at the climax of an amazing dream. I want PvP players to have fun too, though. Personally, I think a karma/reputation and bounty system should exist to deal with players who like to jump out and PvP people at random all the time--too many attacks [especially on players below your level or repeated ambushes on the same player] and your karma/reputation gets so bad that there's a bounty gets placed on your head and other players can hunt you down to defeat you [with no consequences to their own karma/rep, reguardless of their level] to claim the bounty. The best part is, you can't see your karma/rep score and you and people on your Friends list can't see your name on the bounty board, so you won't know that there's a price on your head until it's too late! Once your bounty is collected, your karma/rep is reset to neutral. PvP people can still have their fun [maybe more so as a subculture of bounty hunters develops around the bounty system], and PvE people will be happy knowing that eventually that annoying ganker is going to get his.)So, yes, I recommend AQ3D. I recommend it to fans of RPG's of all kinds, I recommend it to anyone who played the AQ family of browser-based games back in the day, I recommend it to people who have never played an MMORPG before, I recommend it to hardcore players looking for a ""chill out"" title, I recommend it to people with older or less powerful machines, and I definitely recommend it to people who are young-at-heart and have a silly sense of humor. If any new MMORPG today has any hope of being a WoW-sized hit, it's AQ3D.",1

STO Does have a gambling system called the lockbox (pay $1.25 for 1 key, and drop chances are usually 1/500) which needs to be fixed and balanced, but is otherwise pretty good. In all the game does have a nice story arc, but needs more max level activities, due to the lack of things available to max level characters. I will be making some guides in the future for this game if anyone needs to learn some things such as how Inertia, or momentum affects starships and etc. I PERSONALLY rate this game 10/10! but beware pay to wins and pay to players, they will GREATLY have a massive advantage over you.Most star ships I will say, are pay to play, but it is ENITRELEY possible and quite easy to get one Especially during the anniversary event (via omega particles) buy buying your wanted ship from the exchange.

If you don't believe me there are plenty of other reviews that state something similar.  Just the addition of the Evolve mechanic alone adds all kinds of depth and options to gameplay.  A card can't be evolved till turn four.  The player who goes first gets to evolve twice per match, the other player three times.   A player can only evolve once per turn.  Every card has the ability to be ""Evolved."" Evolving sometimes gives a card a static +2/+2, sometimes it just adds new mechanics.  Also, that evolved creature even with summoning sickness can attack an enemy creature, but still cannot attack the general/hero.  If you've played ANY card game, you know how aweful it feels to draw a early game card at like turn ten.  Atleast you can evolve a 2/2 to a 4/4 and attack an enemy creature, in a desperate situation that might be enough.After the tutorial, which is striaghtforward and simple, you get 10 free packs of the standard block and each expansion.  Thats literally 40 packs of cards out the gate.  With those I got about 8 legendary cards and about 20 rares.  You will not be disadvanteged for coming into this game late.  Also it is way less grindy than Hearthstone.  You get 8 cards/Pack, you can earn gold way easier (packs are also 100 gold). I'm not someone who bases a games value on graphics/art but Shadowverse did a great job. Evolving also changes the card's art.   Most bronze cards just swap colors and add a few details.  Silver and up can have some suprisingly dynamic changes.  Also, if you care about this kind of thing, each form of the card will have seperate voice lines.  Some where generally etertaining, none so far have made me cringe.The single player mode has stories for each of the characters.  I've only played 5 missions for one of the characters, but I was suprisingly interested in the story.  There is more I can say, but just find out for yourself.What do you have to lose? It's free to play. ",1
9577,SMITE®,2018.0,"SMITE is a game with some nice character design and a unique perspective for a MOBA, and literally no other redeeming qualities. Everything bad will be bad forever. Their sense of balance is a trainwreck centered around Conquest (the basic MOBA mode, equivalent to Summoner's Rift in League of Legends) with zero regard for the two concievably-fun modes, or any others, though plenty of characters are unabashedly overpowered or horrible on Conquest, as well. Again, this will never change, unless it's for the worse.There is a continuous attempt to convince players to spend money on the game, with many of the cosmetics vanishing forever, often the ones requiring a massive toll of both time and money. Many more skins can only be obtained through chests, rather than bought directly, to extort more money from gambling addicts.HiRez should definitely hire an actual programmer at some point. Every single patch is a storm of broken UI functionality, disconnects from the server, and outright crashing.HiRez hates fun. They firmly segregate character classes, with magical and physical being the main division, and barring the one passive item, no one of these types is allowed to deal the other type. They also acknowledge, if anything at all from the community, the absolute worst suggestions made by the worst people, which brings me to my next point.The community is despicable. You haven't known hatred until you've experienced a Nox main on Arena. It may seem childish to wish someone actual real-life harm over a video game, but if any force on Earth can cause that to happen, it's SMITE. And Arena is an actually fun mode, despite having minions be too valuable. Conquest players hate you for not playing exactly how they want, and also hate you because they are terrible about the game they are yelling at you over. They only know one thing, and that is that they hate you, personally, and wish you the worst life has to offer, including being trapped in a game with them. Surrender is theoretically possible at 10 minutes (not early enough, but better than League's 20), but almost never passes.The matchmaking is analogous to a war crime. It appears to take the average ELOs of two handfuls of people, which means that, despite the asymmetrical reasoning this creates, you, specifically, get a team of people far below your skill level and must defeat a team only slightly below your skill level, which means you 1v5 against fed players.Of course, the company may have committed actual crimes, because employee reviews have painted its CEO to be a despicable, arrogant, 1% representative manchild who insists that balance is whatever he does well with.Play SMITE if you want to poison your soul so deeply that you feel contempt and betrayal even looking at a MOBA or a book on religion. Otherwise, try literally any other game, but still not League as it may actually be worse. ",0
9642,Infestation: The New Z,2017.0,Not bad in parts but sick to death of the people that instantly kill you every single time even if you no weapons.

19160,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThe optimization is good. Graphics is excellent. But match making and aiming(specially hip firing) totally sucks. Running animantion totally sucks. The game was running well but there are so many huge stutter. Once the game literally stuck at 4 fps. Really!? At first i was getting 120+.

6619,Star Trek Online,2016.0,"This game is a absolutely misery, worst of all they don't even fix their problems, report system does not even work... missions are constantly bugged, some since the creation of the game... aim system is bad, poorly planned, the characters creation is terrible, poor options making everybody looking like ""brothers"", bad enought to have the game unavailable during 1 day weekly (or more depending of what they done) but we notice they don't even run trial to make sure it isn't bugged/defects in the contents constantly creating new problems with their weekly cooldowns, in their events what you mostly notice is that no matter how good your computer is there will always be lag that you constantly get disconnected from the servers, I not to mention they♥♥♥♥♥♥so many players that some attack them surprisingly with sucess, I don't understand why the biggest concern is getting visual planets enviroment in great details instead of developing the gameplay? Their ships travel from point A to B in what should be considered the called ""warp speed"" but a snail gets there faster, honestly in my opinion this is a poor promotion of what star trek is and it should be, PvP system was dead since it's creation, never fixed it or added something interesting, to be honest if this game was called ""anything else online"" it simple would not exist anymore, the game survives thanks to the tittle of star trek and their hardcore fans that deserve a medal for playing this sad excuse of a game.A very generous evaluation due to all the problems of the game,2/10",0

14514,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is the perfect blend of Hearthstone, Magic, and Hex. It has the easy accessibility of Hearthstone and simple controls/visuals, the deeper strategy and complexity of Magic, and the mana/influence system from Hex which makes for a much quicker moving game than Magic.

I like it and will continue to play.",1
9849,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Simply put, Tree of Savior is fun as hell and it isn't a clone of World of Warcraft.Now then, allow me to elaborate.First of all, the music is phenomenal. The tracks are well composed, diverse, and beautiful. If that isn't enough, each area generally has multiple tracks so that you aren't listening to one song on repeat which is a really nice touch that most developers overlook.Secondly, the graphics. While not hyper realistic or over the top, the graphics of Tree of Saviour are an interesting blend of 2D sprite components and 3D cell shading that create a gorgeous artistic style that can still be run by lower end machines.Next, even at low levels, your skills feel powerful. Your moves have nice flashy animations that are impressive, and monsters explode on death making huge group kills ever so satisfying. Bosses are fun and interesting, scaling in challenge as you level up and progress through the story.Moving on, the questing experience is different from other games. The NPCs that provide you with side-quests are often unmarked, so for the first time in a game in years I found myself talking to all the NPCs in an area. I learned about my surroundings, found a ton of extra quests, and enjoyed the exploration / interaction aspect that this deisgn choice creates. I do understand though that this aspect of the game isn't for everyone, so it is definitely something to be aware of.The Cash Shop is purely costume and convenience items and steers clear of a Pay to Win environment. In fact, most of the Cash Shop items that matter at all are tradeable like the Premium Token, Tree of Savior's subscription equivalent.Character customization may seem scare at character creation, but when you realize that the vast majority of the character customization options are both toggleable and available from the Market, Achievements, and the Class System, the lack of options during Charaction Creation kind of ceases to matter.The Class and Statistic Systems are intense. There are over 80 Classes in the game and there are a boat load of combinations that you can build. You assign your stat points too, giving you complete control over your character.The amount of options you have to control your character are fantastic. Want to use a Keyboard to do everything? You can. Not a fan of Keyboards and want to use your Mouse for everything? You can do that too. You like kicking it old school and want to lean back and use a Controller? Well, that's also an option. Want to switch between them? The game will just swap on the fly. You could drop your Controller and break it mid boss fight, and just start playing with the Keyboard if you knew your keybinds. That's awesome, cause Mouse and Controller batteries always seem to die at the worst times.Finally, if you played the original Ragnarok Online, Tree of Savior feels like coming back to your house from an extended vacation. Things are familiar, you have to get used to them again, but above all, you're back home.I would highly recommend this game. Haters gonna hate, I'm gonna play Tree of Savior.Thanks for reading! Have a good one, and if you're gaming, may all your loots be phat!Z",1

Earn points by playing tutorials.Some things I don't like:1. Sometimes the mana tapping can be flawed.

Build your own deck filters could be improved.",1

11178,Robocraft,2017.0,"TLDR: as almost all reviews suggest, game was better back pre-mid 2015. Bad decisions have killed the game for much of its former playerbase, if you are thinking about playing the game. Don't, it's simply not worth it.Simple, developers killed what was core to the game. Skill is now second to luck, as creation in the game is limited by lootboxes (an incredible mark of poor judgement). Better when the game had an honourable tech tree system that allow players to choose a particular path they wanted to go. Honestly robocraft is now a shriveled burnt corpse of its former self, It used to reward you for being both a good builder, and a good player. Not because you managed to get lucky in a loot system that is completely random and out of place. I would happily reccomend this game to people in 2014 (when it received indie game of the year award) and early 2015 during the megabot update. As it was what I had been searching for in a game for what seemed like forever, a team based building game that would reward the skill of the builder and the player. I have no idea what they were thinking when they introduced a clan system, lootboxes and non specialised robots. Why? If the Devs decide to revert some of the changes, I assume many people including myself would flock back to the game. Freejam killed their success.",0
15304,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,I wont tell you this game amazing.

5923,Minion Masters,2017.0,Early Access ReviewNothing special to add to this genre. Fun for a short time before the game is giving you no option but to pay up or play a tedious amount of games daily. I say tedious because there comes a point you are just losing to a endless stream of people who clearly just spent money and have great cards. You can never really progress... you can only hover at the same level. Wins come when you play a fair game against someone with equal power card wise and you'll have to play a few games where you are destined to lose to get to those.I got it with extra in game currency in a Humble bundle and thats the only way id have ever tried it. Really not worth any money at all... kind of disappointed I even bothered playing it for as long as I did.,0
844,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI put more hours into this than I expected, really. I was originally looking for something to scratch my MTG itch while waiting to see if I got a Beta key for Arena, but, after playing this, I really couldn't care less to get one. My only real gripe with the game is that some of the art is rather... displeasing to my tastes, while also addressing that this is an early access card game. There's going to be balancing issues. There's going to be shifts. That's expected; however, what is here is a joy to play. Got it both on PC and Tablet and I can say that it has become one of my favorite digital card games in almost no time. As for the Redshell debacle, I think I came into this after that, so I cannot say anything on the matter.I will update this review as time goes by, but, so far, I recommend it. (Though I am just a filthy casual: Gauntlet, Forge, Casual, and Draft for life).Edit 1: After three weeks, I managed to unlock the first campaign, Jekk's Bounty, with only gold you earn in-game. 20,000. If I had to estimate the amount of time I truly played, between PC and Tablet, I would say about 30 hours. That's about... 666 gold an hour... I did not expect that number, but... yeah! The other campaigns currently out are 25,000 apiece, so it's roughly 35-to-40 hours to unlock campaigns --or $30, if you prefer to pay. In all truth, that's still good value. I have about 43% of the original card stock unlocked through simply chests, and about 10% of the special packs each, with the exception being Fall of Argenport at 28%.Edit 2: I finally received a closed beta code for MTGA... I knew I made the right call. This game feels FAR BETTER to play. Let's break down my first, oh, thirty games out of MTGA's tutorial. First game, used the green deck, I swore my opponent was a bot with how bad they played. Second game, same issue... Third game, WHIPLASH. I was obviously NOT on the same level with the guy, and I got creamed. Fourth-tenth game, lost due to manaflood. 11 card draws in a row, all lands. Twelth game, guy quit after calling seven mulligans, having nothing in his hand. Thirteenth-through-seventeenth, actually good games. Fair. Balanced. I lost fifteen and sixteen, but they were fun. Eigtheen-through-twenty-five were jobs. Opposite problem this time; I only had TWO LANDS the entire time. Twenty-six through twenty-eight swapped to the black deck, got nothing but high-priced cards, and twenty-nine and thirty I played blue and once more faced people WAY out of my skill level.Let's break all that down, shall we? 1) Matchmaking is hilariously bad. Sure, it's quick. None of them went above 15 seconds, but they were laughably one-sided for most of them. 2) deck randomization/""shuffling"" is not working as intended, unless it is to inspire hatred. 3) IT WAS BORING. The UI layout is pretty, but when you have to look at it for easily fifteen minutes a match, waiting as someone agonizingly waits out timers to play the most simple of spells, it grows old fast.Overall, I much prefer Eternal over MTGA. Just... Eternal may have its issues, but, after dealing with that, I am coming back with a smile on my face. I mean, I never left, but... I don't know where I was going with that. And to clarify: I don't hate MTGA. It's fine for what it is, and it has the capacity to get better.Edit 3: Twitch Prime! Lots of goodies... this is going to be a critiquing post.One, I have to agree, standard decks are a touch too big. I believe 75 is just a tad too large. On top of that, it demanding EXACTLY 1/3 of it being land is a touch annoying. Note that I am not saying you should run below it, but there are some strategies where having, say, two or four less lands does work into its favor. Also note you can have more than a 1/3 lands, as well.Two, Time-Justice combo is overpowered. Period. Just like Green in MTG, it runs rampant. The fact certain combos haven't been nerfed while Tribal's Levitate was speaks volumes...Three, the mobile app has become a nightmare to play... There's not much else I can say about that. It feels like it takes forever updating or something in the code has been changed enough for it to run like crap on my tablet AND phone. Computer one still runs perfectly fine.Really, these are minor gripes. I'm closing on the 45-hour mark on PC, and, got to say, still want to keep playing. That's an achievement in of itself.Edit 4: DWD making me working overtime. :) They did nerf the combo.Edit 5: To sum up all the negative reviews in one, tidy package-""RNG IS BAD SO IT IS BAD."" Translation: I don't know how to build a deck or rework it so I can do better and instantly blame everyone but myself.""TUTORIAL TOO LONG."" They already said they are working on it.""MANA SYSTEM IS BAD AND WOULDN'T BE BECAUSE [insert popular game here]!"" The irony in these people is palpable, esp. those saying the creator would have done something different. Probably, but hindsight is 20/20. Get. Over. it.""HEARTHSTONE RIP-OFF."" In terms of... Oh. Right. They just say it. If its for the UI... WOW. a GOOD UI THAT OTHERS TRY TO REPLICATE WHILE ADDING THEIR OWN TAKE ON IT? SAY IT AIN'T SO... Artstyle? Different enough. Gameplay? more like Magic-Lite.""CERTAIN CARDS ARE OP AND IMBALANCED."" Welcome to card games. Also, those that usually say this also add the first two, which, again, the irony because they blame everything but themselves for failing.This should wrap up what most people say to get approved. If you are these kinds of people, I feel so sorry for you... Oh, and Red Shell, but, as the initial review has stated, cannot speak on that.Edit 6: Since this has become a thoughtpiece on my opinion of MTG Arena as well as Eternal, I guess I'll post what I think of it after it came to open b-Don't. Even. Bother.They learned NOTHING in the transition. Matchmaking is still crap. Deck shuffling algorithm is still crap, and this is me making my mono-green ramp carnage tyrant-Vine Mare-Blanchwood combo again with 97% winrate. Only Boros at the moment comes close, and they are all the same cookie-cutter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. On top of that, they cut rewards for winning games, making grinding an obscene chore while, also, allowing paid players to keep their currency --which is fine IF THE MATCHMAKING WAS GOOD.In every aspect, Eternal has shown to be the more rewarding game. The more fun game. Sure, it can have its stagnant meta decks, but more oft than not I ran into people doing SOMETHING different. SOMETHING that went against the mundanity of the meta.Edit 7: WotC ""listened"" to the community for MTG:A... It feels like they planned it the entire time and were using it for good press. Until they actually listen and follow up on what is being said, since closed mind, I'm not changing my stance on it.That being said, [in Eternal] I joined the new league... I had terrible luck with the packs, but I still find it fun to watch. Another point to this game: it pushed me to try the ""non-casual"" scene, and I enjoyed it. Plus, that card back is sexy.",1
6231,Neverwinter,2014.0,"Note: This is being written just weeks after the Mod 5 launch. A lot can change in a few months so the relevance of some of the below information may be questionable in the months to come.I'm not quite certain where to begin with this.. All of this is based on my current experience with the game which I don't feel is really enough time to review it but I am moving on so I figured I could give some answers to questions I had going in.The game is an enjoyable experience and personally a perfect game for me. I love the combat, graphics, classes, etc. While there are a few minor gripes I would consider Neverwinter an positive experience whether you've spent a lot of time in MMOs or not, though like any other title it has it's flaws. If you're going to go in with a strictly F2P route in mind then the grind will be long and tedious after a while. The game lacks end game content, but the Devs are taking big strides in the right direction. PvP - Currently PvP is a super hit or miss thing with the community. P2W players can hit outrageous highs with no real need for a grind aside from a fat bank account. This isn't a big issue however because a typical player can grind out enough to at least nip the ankles of these PvP P2W titans in a weeks worth of grinding.PvE - Dungeons exist, but the time it takes to run with a good player is pretty small. Most dungeons can be solo'd so adding in four other players to one who is able to solo can make a dungeon run a fifteen minute task. There are a few tougher dungeons but you'll often find some powerhouse group in the LFG chat to run you through.There are a few other PvE events that are currently running in the game (post Mod 5) that have added a lot more content to end game PvE. These are small open world events where you (and up to 19 other people) fight an extremely ""challenging"" horde/boss and get rewards based on your performance, these can also be solo'd once you've gotten enough power under your belt. These are by far the best PvE experience currently in my opinion. The biggest thing to look out for in this game is the horrid zen market. You can easily sink money into this game and not know how much is flowing from your wallet until it's too late. At this point in time I have spent over $1000 between my wife and I on this game with nothing in game to really show for it, which is a big part of why I'm moving on from it.All in all the game is a really heavy grind, especially to get to top tier, but it is possible to become max geared without paying a cent. This is not a pay to win game, to misquote another player, this is a ""pay for convenience"" game. If you want to reach the top tier of your respected front you can either sit back and enjoy the daily grind for hundreds of hours or pay thousands of dollars to get there. The choice is yours and no one will ever have anything that gives them an advantage over you that you're unable to get by taking the opposite route.Hope this helps at least one person to better understand what they will be getting into here. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope you are able to enjoy Neverwinter for what it really is.",1

1430,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,2017.0,"The Elder Scroll Legends Game steals shamelessly from Hearthstone, and this makes it a good game. Where it is ""unique"" from hearthstone it is gimmicky, but those places are few and far between. The pros:If you play hearthstone, you already know how to play, how to get around, and how to win.It is shiny and beautiful, with better voice acting than the AAA Elderscrolls games (I know, not saying much)It has more modes and game types than hearthstone. THE MOST IMPORTANT PRO TO ME: it is still a manageable size. I left hearthstone behind because it was a bloated complicated mess with more content dumped on top weekly. This is currently a great size, and as a new game, there is less of a pro userbase to kick me down. (#realnoobtalk)The cons:The AI, although fun to play, is fairly weak. It makes clumsy decisions frequently. It steals almost everything from heathstone, and comes across as an amature effort because of that. I mean it steals... Everything. There is a heavy imbalance towards going second. The triple gem ring keeps you tight on curve and makes it hard to lose.We shall see!

13539,Paladins®,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game was fun, for sure. It used to have an interesting deck customization system that allowed you to choose different play styles.But with OB64 this is going to change in a few minutes now (game has been down for 9 hours because of update deployment). No more free deck customization, introduction of a P2W mode for what used to be casual (a place to chill and train). Ranked games won't allow customization anymore. Every decision made for this patch is messed up.If you are still considering downloading this game here are a few other points where Hi-Rez lost this game and failed this community:- Matchmaking is terrible (not based on your skills or rank).- Power Creep is live with new champs always making more dmg than the older ones.- Balance is completely inconsistent with changes that can kill your champ in one single update. Just for reasons that won't ever be explained (say hi to Ash for me).- Bugs everywhere that made us call this game Palabugs (true story).- Support team will never really help you if you loose points based on techical bugs. At the end of the day, it is always unclear if it is on their side, so they consider it's your fault (presumption of innocence anyone?).- Community has never been shaped well. They do not listen to their players.- They release more and more heroes that require no skill (auto aim or crazy area dmg).Anyway, if you are still going to hit that ""play now"" button, good luck, have fun. My friends already all left, so I suppose I'm next.",0

20111,Neverwinter,2015.0,I believe so far that being a noob in this game..is quite cool..ALL the gearI have picked up..ACTUALLY works..also when people are fighting dungeons they dont descriminate by not helping you..the high level players dont look down on you..but they dont pay attention to you eithier...lol  you can pretty much solo until the story takes you to a dungeon of group BOSS fight then you have to wait for someone to show  up and HOPE they are not low level  as well..lolSo in this game I wuold say if you solo it BE PREPARED to wait...If youve got friends who play..then you are GOLDEN,1
8345,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"Unfortunately this game has no real offline progress calculation like my other idle games. Sure you get gold and xp based on time offline, but no actual levels skipped. It is a huge waste of computer resources to keep this game constantly running to actually make the auto-progress feature work. (Maxes out one of my CPU cores and eats ♥♥♥ MB ram)I enjoy the core gameplay loop, the new crafting system (multiple characters decked out in 5 times upgraded legendaries, yay!)Having to start over from level 1 all the time however, is a hassle. I can instant kill my way up to level 200 with any unupgraded level 1 hero, so why can't I just skip to that point automatically? Speechacking helps to cut down on time wastage, but still... Also, once level 200 is reached I just buy every hero and upgrade and proceed to instakill all the way to level 700 without touching the game once. No challenge. And once the challenging part is reached I can just reset... This is not as much fun anymore. Watching the game play itself oh so very slowly.Levels that require you to constantly click (two examples are invisible enemies in mugwarts, and the unkillable aliens in last week's event that die to one click) can't be afk'd. (Autoclicker recommended for these.)",0

423,Magic Duels,2016.0,"Still has same clumsy issues as 2012,2013,2014... The game is actually worse than its precessors as it's incredibly unoptimally built graphics wise. In terms of gameplay Magic itself just isn't there. What you get is an extremely narrow card selection that in its simplicity is clearly pointed towards beginners and younger people. The coolest thing in MTG is exploring new strategies and this game doesn't let you get into that at all.- cards cost a lot and there's very few available (not even basic mtg strategies are available, no synergetic decks)- cannot still remap some keys even though the same engine has been under improvement since 2011- no other sold game has as unoptimal graphics- bad netcode- very brutal sound effects; as if compressor was set to maximum pressure; hey, it's a card game, not a nuclear cataclysm !- and why out of all strategies land destruction was selected for this game; people just quit...+ is free in a fair way",0

11355,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal combines the best parts of Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering to create a CCG experience that is similar to both but unlike either. MTG players will recognize mechanics similar to lands, dual lands, instants, five different mana colors, and battle mechanics like trample, deathtouch, lifesteal, first strike, and flying. Because this game is digital, it can do things that you could never do with physical MTG cards, like the Warcry mechanic that add +1/+1 to the top unit of your deck when you attack. There are much fewer RNG elements here than Hearthstone, and some nice of themes to build your deck around like an army of valkyries, a gang of gunslingers, a pack of dniosaurs, or suicidal grenadins.Progression feels so much more rewarding than in Hearthstone! In addition to daily quests, you also get a free card pack for your first win of the day, and these packs have TWELVE cards instead of five AND include enough crafting materials to make a common or uncommon card of your choice. Yes, you get crafting materials IN the card packs! You also get gold for every win (not every 3 wins) which can be spent on card packs. There is also a leveling system in place for each of the 5 factions (red, blue, green, black, and white). When you level up in a faction, you get additional rewards like gold or a free pack, and XP is earned based on the decks you play. So focus on one or two colors to level those up faster, or run a rainbow deck (and there are some GREAT rainbow decks) to level up all five evenly.You have the typical PvP modes like casual, ranked, and a draft pick that is extraodinary! After you pay the entry fee, you open a bunch of randomized card packs and then pick and pass to create a pool, and from that pool you create a deck. It's almost exactly like something you'd see at a MTG event. There are also PvE modes here. The Gauntlet has you fight AI opponents using any custom decks you've created, and Forge is like Hearthstone's draft pick mode. There are a few campaigns that have a steep entry fee but give you guaranteed rewards.All in all, I really enjoy Eternal far more than Hearthstone or Magic. And oh yeah, there is a mobile app as well, so I can play on the bus to work. I've played a lot of digital card games (Hearthstone, Gwent, Faeria, Duelyst, Legends) and Eternal ranks #1 in my book.",1
146,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,"While this game is an inovative first person experience, with great graphical effects, realistic characters and one of the best plots i've seen in games so far, I do have some points of critic: 1. the storytelling is pretty linear and sometimes makes you feel like your ingame choices dont matter 2. the Bosses are way to hard to beat while fapping",1

1220,GUNS UP!,2017.0,"Early Access Reviewi would have liked a little more control over my unit's movements, but seeing as the ""massive advancing wall of infantry"" strategy popular in the Imperial Guard is a very powerful, that might have been a balance decision.other than that, this game really needs a lot of work, mostly on the frequent disconnection and crashes side, the functioning UI explaining the stats of everything side, and the explaining what everything means and how everything works side.the art style is really vibrant and colorful. Soft cartoony look without cell shading everything. Also the music is pretty good, though there's not a lot of it to go around.All in all, it's a reasonably good timesink mobile-style game that ironically isn't on mobile but actually started life on the PS4(with a much better UI compared to what's in the game at the time of writing). It's a little rough around the edges, sometimes in ways that makes sense, other times less so (the UI) and I look forward to spending more time with this in future.",1

17927,DCS World Steam Edition,2018.0,"First of all it may show I only have 2.2 hours on record but that is because I use the stand-alone version of DCS. I will still leave a review as both versions are near enough the same.First of all I see a lot of reviews, positive and negative, refering to this as a game. Even if the devs did call this a game at one point it is not strictly the case. This is nearer a professional flight simulator than it is a game. So if you are looking for an arcade flying game and not a simulator, look elsewhere.I have played DCS for a while now and I also own a fair few of its modules and I have to say I thoroughly enjoy it. It is a beautiful flight sim with an enormous amount of attention paid to detail. Not kidding, there is so much detail on certain mdules that even the circuit breakers and air vent slits are modeled. The majority of modules also come with an extremely detailed exterior and damage model and they also come with a professional flight model which makes DCS a leader in realistic combat aircraft handling characteristics. It is comparable to X-Plane 11 commercial aircraft flight models, but DCS exceeds X-plane 11 in the combat aircraft flight models. But this is just a light comparison as these two programs were made for different purposes.Now before I make my final round-up, I would like to address the reviews which complain about the prices of modules being the same as AAA games. They are that price because of the Research and Development costs which goes into those modules. As they put so much detail in their modules it takes a lot of time and money and frankly, looking at the finished products, you can see that it cost them a lot. So for those reviews saying it is not their real value, think again, for what you get is AAA game quality. You even get a frikin 500+ page manual on ALL modeled systems and combat employment for your plane/ helicopter.Final Verdict: DCS is the best combat flight simulator you can get on the market. With beautiful worlds and highly detailed modules its hard not to be impressed by it. The learning curve is huge but if you are patient enough you will get to grips with your plane and the sense of achievment you get when reaching a level of competency in your chosen module(s) is fantastic. Sure there are a few bugs here and there but it is rare nowadays to see a prgram without fault. In the end, I would recomend this to patient flight simers looking for a good combat aircraft sim and for people looking for arcady gameplay and easy learning then look somewhere else. This game is compatible with VR and being a VR user myself, it just makes it even more thrilling, especially as they are starting to add Oculus Touch support.",1

The game used to be great, it was balanced, you could build your own cool designes, and fight other people with similar teir items in a balanced game of skill. Now, if you don't pay money you are severly underpowered against the vast amount of pay to win people. They nerfed all items that were obtainable legit, and made it so you can just buy robots from other people. You dont even have to build robots now, just pay money to get robots.

19767,Bless Online,2018.0,"I wanted to like this game, since US developers/publishers have abandoned mainline MMORPGs.PRO Summary:- Good 3D graphics- Some novelty in combat mechanics- Easy to follow quest sequences- No gender-locked classes- PvE and PvP play- Territory ownership for guildsCONs Summary- FPS stutters heavily- Messages can conceal important events- Solo play required at early levels, Dungeon teams required at higher levels- Juvneile community with poor policing - trolls, beggars and gold-sellers are common- Slow quest pacing - lots of talk, little action, with mediocre English translation and weak voice acting- No manual, nearly useless publisher-supported wikiCOMMUNITY ANGEREarly access cost $30, then game became F2P when it went live. Those who paid were enraged, and many left, leaving the game with a relatively small community. The community has very immature tendancies and comes across are not very welcoming. POOR ENGINEERINGMost developers invest a few months (before launch) refactoring the data loading and 3D system. That was not done in this game. As a result, UI inputs can have up to a 1.5 second delay, and the framerate stutters frequently. Use game default video settings and go into the capital city. Just rotate in place with a character. The rotation is full of lurches and burps, with various dropped animation frames. Similar things happen during movement and combat. No self-respecting US developer would let this out the door.INEPT GAME DESIGNQuests have ton of dull, repetitive storyline with amateurish voice acting. However, gameplay teaching quests are brief, often mysterious, and frequently lacking,  The game prohibits useful groups in the main storyline (all battles send the player into a solo instance). Even if you want to help somebody else through a difficult part in that quest, you can't. However,  after level 30 dungeons are virtually required, and you must group up for dungeons.  Not only is there no manual, but the publisher-supported wiki is hopelessly theadbare, with frequent pleas for contributions.The designers never considered how to help players recover from trouble. For example, the Paladin (healer) class faces a difficult level 4 solo battle. The battle is nearly impossible to win unless you use all the new tactics and skills you just got a bit earlier in that quest when you graduated to level 4. Never mind that the announcements can happen in the middle of another fight, and obscure what's happening in the 3D world.  You must win that fight to continue the main quest and the game. Finishing a quest is 5,000+ XP, while killing monsters is 8 XP, so don't try to bypass the mainline quest by kill-grinding.  There are many similar quests which you have just one chance to succeed. After that, the quest is marked as a failure - permanently.This appears again at level 6. You're given some free single-use scrolls to learn how the (undocumented) pet training interface works. by trial and error.  If you err too much, you run out of scrolls. Can you get more scrolls? Can you restart the quest? Nope to both - quest just remains in your list, uncompleted, for eternity.  If you visit the quest giver, they just issue wordy taunts to you.  TL;DRThis game had betas in Russia and Korea, which both failed (the servers were shut down). Neowiz top management made a few changes without understanding the real issues, did cheap translations and voice-overs in English, and did some bone-headed marketing. Of course the game is unpleasant to play.",0

Granted Trove is rather new, the blogs and updates from the creators make the game even more promising. I look forward to be able to do world bosses or the such in the future.

Eternal is a freaking awesome fusion of Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone. I always needed a new card game after MTG kept releasing such f*_king garbage computer games and Hearthstone became 100% about RNG, 100% bull$h½t decks and 0% skill.I only wish we had some more boards (but they are coming), different combat animations and some more dynamic music. Also I wish people like Kripparrian played this and I guess he would if more people played it but seeing as he makes his money doing Hearthstone videos, he plays that instead. Honestly, I'm just hoping this game stays the way that it is. It's not pay2win at all, they literally throw you free cards and free packs for just playing. The only things you absolutely have to pay for, are cosmetics that give zero benefit playing against the A.I. or other people and for a couple of very specific kinds of cards available through the long campaigns, but you can still easily buy these campaigns after a few days of gold grinding the gauntlet and playing against the A.I.Conclusion:I've spent days reading up on the meta, crafting decks and playing all the campaigns. I've played unbeatable Tavrod decks and I've gotten my butt kicked tons of times in a row. Yet unlike hearthstone when I do lose, I don't feel salty or ripped off like I do EVERY SINGLE TIME I play Hearthstone. Hearthstone either makes me hate my opponent or hate myself. I've won and lost 100s of games in Eternal and maybe only 2 or 3 times I felt cheated. As for the community, there's a little 'BM' here and there but NOTHING like what you sadly have to experience in Hearthstone.11/10. Love it or hate it, but seeing as we have no decent MTG games for PC or Console and Hearthstone has sucked for ages, I will happily take this for as long as it isn't anything like Hearthstone. 8/8 m8 keep the goodies coming.",1

16697,Bless Online,2018.0,"Hi,I've been trying to play this game since the beginning of the afternoon and I'm now ready for supper. In the mean time I had to deal with a bug, making only the UI visible on a dark screen. I had to play with .ini files to manage to set the game in 1920*1200. When that happened, I had something like 3 FPS (not joking) and 5 minutes later still no hair on my character or any kind of amelioration regarding framerate while in game. I finally resorted to play with a much lower res.Between the tutorial and the begining of the adventure, my key configuration was erased... I may not have the latest monster in term of hardware, but I can run a number of game that are still quite demanding. I couldn't test much but that kind a bug, which after looking around seems not that uncommon, is still hard to swallow for a game that has been around for that long. It's not a CBT, or even an early access. Playing a game in such condition that you have to tweak everything to a minimum, not because it's an awfully high graphic rendering game, but because it's poorly coded, isn't fun. I wanted to love this game, I've been following it since its official announcement, through the multiple releases and reworks, always waiting for the version that would alleviate the worries of early reviews. Knowing that the game is dead in Korea, I thought I would finally give a try and make my own mind about it. Well, not happening. Too sad, I feel like that game had much to offer. I will move to A:IR ascent as it has a little something that is not without making me think about Bless.",0

726,Dota 2,2017.0,There used to be a game called DOTA 2. Then a new patch (7.00) came out and turned it into a copy of League of Legends. That patch changed almost every aspect of the game. I liked it the way it was. ,0
14431,SMITE®,2017.0,"At this point in time i have 799 hours logged. I'm gonna do a short and sweet review of the game and try and list a few things that are diffrent than other MOBA'S and hopefully give you guys some insight for people looking to get into the game. Smite is a 3rd person MOBA unlike most MOBA's, which are usually top down, now with that being said makes the game imo a whole diffrent type of MOBA and the way i prefer to play a MOBA.I've only played around 3 matches of LoL, and as ive said before i prefer the 3rd person aspect, top down games just arent my style, so i cant really compare this to other MOBA'sNow. to get to the basics, you have your Guardians,Mages,Warriors,Hunters and Assassins, All of which are all fun to play my preffered class would usually be a guardian or mage seeing that not many people choose to play guardians and that hunters are far to generic.Hunters- Hunters are your standard point and hold left click for the most part they are effective early game but most useful in late game scenarios to shut down the lower health gods easily and also beat down your enamy Tank.Mages- All around good class used to shut down most all god types most having a very diffrent kit and reasonably diffrent from each other enough to realize you're playing another god and not a re-skin of another.Guardians- Guardians are your preferred tank class although warriors can also be very tanky most guardians are fun in their own way and all have a play in the game but less than the other classes imo unless the right hands are behind them.Warriors- Warriors are very fun to play alot of them have good kits and some of them being very overpowered in the right hands and some being huge game changers for your 5v5 fights in late game joust.Assassins- Assassins are very crucial to your Conquest matches (5v5) and quite a few of them are left untouched during seasons due to a few being Overpowered, They're used for your jungling and to gank lane as most moba's.Now that thats over with i'd like to touch base on a few of the things i like and dont like about smite.Pro's- Visually the game looks great every one of the gods are very detailed, maps look great and the spells and abilities really bring all of it to life during matches.3rd person aspect- as ive said before i dont enjoy top down games and if you do thats fine you may still like smite regardless, Top down just isnt my cup of tea.Community- All in all the community is great in a whole if you join in solo for the most part if there are people playing solo as well they are usually nice, although you can have teams of clan people who are toxic just as there would be toxic people in other Moba's but smite seems to have less toxicity than other Moba's too me.Updates-Smite is regularly updated with new content Very Often, in the last year It's seen around 11 new gods meaning we see new gods almost every month, Gods usually stay relatively balanced with your select few that are more overpowered than others, but High-Rez stays on top of it.Gods-All of the gods feel diffrent to me very few of them have simialar skills and for the most part all of the gods in the game are fun and ANY of them can be good if they are in the right hands.Cons-Unfortunately there are some bad things about smite and i will tell you what my biggest problems with the game are.Hunters- Hunters are fun to play and i wont lie i love to play Neith,Ah Muzen Cab, Xblanque and many others, BUT they need to be nerfed unlike League (going by word of mouth) Yes, their abilities help them in fights tremendously but some if not all of them by end game only have to hold down left click to kill anybody, doesnt matter what their opponent is even guardians get melted with full physical protection, I'd suggest removing penetration items from the game, They make being a guardian not fun.Guardians- There are alot of fun guardians in the game BUT, as ive said in the previous statement Hunters can melt them, just as any other class can in the right hands, they just dont feel tanky enough most of the time no matter how much armor you build, and even at this point you can build for damage so you do no damage and die regardless due to the lack of damage resistance from said armor. Although there are many guardians that do alot of damage and are seemingly tankier than others leaving the other guardians hanging out to dry.Now that ive gotten my two biggest gripes over classes out of the way ill list a few diffrent other urks i have with the game.I've previously stated that there isnt alot of toxicity in the game but, I like to play assault alot and i've done this before just in case someone reading this recognizes my name, Being toxic or talking crap in this game-mode makes you look like a huge dbag, You're not playing Ranked-Conquest. Stop acting like it, Thats my only problem with the community is that i can understand when someone is purposely throwing the match/feeding but, if you watch and see that they're actually trying, give them a chance if you lose at the end of the match say gg, nice try they may be new and your actions could be the reason that they stop playing the game, meaning we're losing people from an amazing game that already has a much smaller player base than the likes of Dota 2, or LoL.Last thing is the server downtime, I want this game to grow, and i want the playerbase to grow also, But, it seems like and moreso here recently that the servers have been down quite a bit. in The last month there was upwards of a week (altogether) that i couldnt play because of server downtime. I've read many articles stating that it's Because of DDOS from other developers, I would hope that another company wouldnt stoop that low. My problem with all of this is not that im missing out on playing but afraid that at some point people will get tired of it and go to something else, and im sure im not the only person that feels this way. So High-Rez you've made one of my favorite games of all time, Please, try and fix this problem.Thats the end of all of my pro's/con's and gripes of the game Hopefully this will help you to decide to play or not to play and it answered some questions for you.I'll update my review if anything else sticks out to me. Favorite Gods-Vulcan,Agni,Neith,Khepri,Poseidon.",1

16155,RaceRoom Racing Experience,2015.0,"R3E was absolutely terrible not so long ago. The interface was a nightmare and the racing odd with the huge coloured markers etc. If you judge it on that, let me tell you that it's now a completely different game.The interface now makes sense, and is one of the best you'll find out there. The game is F2P with purchases for content (but the ability to enter certain events without purchasing the content and the option to try before you buy). There are frequent sales so you don't have to spend a fortune.Cars are very impressive with the physics being better than iRacing, Project Cars and Assetto Corsa but not quite as good as RFactor 2. Tracks, while not laser scanned, are not too far off the quality of RF2's non-laser-scanned tracks. The geometry is generally accurate, but of course you don't get the exact bumps, but laser scans quickly become out of date so this isn't as big an issue as one might expect. Sounds are the best you'll find anywhere, really expressing the clunky rattling shaking madness of a real race car.Netcode needs a bit of work [cars behave strangely with high pings and disconnects happen], but multiplayer is in alpha I believe, so hopefully that'll improve in time. The usual issues of only 30% finishing and loads of wrecks apply in public servers but plenty of leagues exist to cater to the more serious racer. Single-player features the most enjoyable AI I've raced against.In short, R3E is VASTLY better than it was, and now deserves a place among the elite of sim-racing.",1

It is nothing alike any other toxic communities, The game is filled with kids (not the ones you expect to see on League of Legends or CSGO but the ones that are actually really nice to you and will show you some tips and tricks if needed/asked but the game is actullay pretty easy to get after you complete the basic tutorial that was invented 3 moths ago and really helps you start playing) and they do NOT even know the word 'Noob' , 'Toxic' etc. So if you are going to install the game please do not make the game comm toxic and thats it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anyways the game is awesome, You should not only TRY it, You should LOVE it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Side Notes (Tips and tricks)Btw the game is filled with ""Indos"" (Indonesians) Do not get distracted by them they will type in their own language or something don't pay attention (but they are still pretty nice guys).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Oh ye and PS.

Instantly, Justin becomes a shark. Horrified, Christian swims away, afraid his former friend might eat him. As time passes, Christian continues to avoid Justin, leaving the shrimp-turned-maneater lonely and frustrated. So when he bumps into the cod again, he begs the mysterious fish to change him back. Lo and behold, Justin is turned back into a prawn. With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes, he swims back to the reef to seek out Christian. As he approaches, he shouts out: “It’s me, Justin, your old friend. I’ve changed… I’ve found Cod. I’m a prawn again, Christian.”",0

1004,Neverwinter,2015.0,"The game is certainly enjoyable for a F2P MMORPG. The dungeons are fun and the progression keeps you interested. Also, the combat feels satisfying. My only real problem with this game starts and ends in the cash shop. Everything is incredibly overpriced, I mean 40 to 50 dollars for a mount? Literally 200 dollars for bonus content? Anybody that knows Perfect World Entertainment knows that their a greedy publisher and they implement their greedy business module into every game they touch. So no suprises there I guess.In conclusion Neverwinter deserves your attention. It's a good game with a bad publisher. Give the game a try and it might just suprise you but keep in mind that if this is a game you plan on sticking with, you'll probably end up emptying out your bank account just to keep up with the top players.",1
7346,Dungeon Defenders II,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI do not recommend that you pay money for this game.  The main reason is the server issues.  Every time I try to play this game with friends we have trouble connecting to each other in private sessions.  Sometimes the game itself will not even load because of bad server connections.  I regret paying money for the game (but that is mainly because it is free to play now).  Also, in my opinion, games that allow you to play but make you pay money for certain things that exist within the game is not cool.  If you do play, since it is free, and you do not have server issues and aren't tempted to pay a ton of money for a different costume, you will probably like the game.

There is a wide variety of costumes to choose from, and there is also a wonderfully detailed system for changing your character's physical dimensions and facial features.

This is a video game in which you kill Monster Girls with your own Booby Busty Warrior Lady. It's Clicker Heroes: Better Edition.,1
7294,Dungeon Defenders II,2017.0,"10/05/2017I wasted my time and money on this game so whoever reads this doesn't have to. You're welcome.6/22/2018I can honestly say, Protean Shift has ""shifted"" this game in a valid direction so far. I still don't recommend it, but I do recommend you keep an eye on it. Because if they continue to make the game fun rather than a chore then all of you DD1 heads like myself and newcomers alike will be able to enjoy the game.",0
15498,EverQuest II,2016.0,"Played this game back in 2004 on release. Saw it on steam under daybreak instead of SOE and gave it a try with it being free to play which it is. Levelup much easier and with dungeon/group finder it is quick to hop in and do something fun. Just working on a character from 1 to max or where you need to buy a pass/subscription which is only actually needed for the end game material. With as much fun as I've had when I get to that point I will get the extra pass. I wish more people would play this because it is the most content and fun filled free to play game I have found on steam. Have a friend to get to level 20 with and then the game really gets going. Still fun, and for someone new like the friends I play this with the game has plenty of tips and shows the new things going on and how to play. If anything this is at least worth a try. It's free for countless hours if you do end up enjoying it.",1
12624,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI came back after a long break from this game and I was shocked by what I saw.  The developer has absolutely ruined the ability for players to build towards a bot of their choice by putting in a crate based loot system in an attempt to squeeze more money out of players. ,0
962,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Reviewi use to play this game so much and have so much fun, build robots, collect and buy new pieces to build fun and new designs. But now the developers have removed all that was fun exept the battles. i actualy remeber investing about 5$ on gc (wich is now removed) and buying a cool robot. all the gc and rp that had been farmed and collected was removed from the game, with that being removed for some thousands of hours down the drain for nothing. And now the game has added crates, this game was given the title ""Best indie game of 2014"" this game and some others is proof start that a great start doesent always lead to a great end.",0
15301,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,2017.0,"This is almost like the ""Gran Turismo of firearms"" the only thing that keeps me granting this title is the lack of Shooting Ranges for all the weapons. The game is constantly updaded with new weapon models to assemble and... dissassemble including vehicles.This game is gun eroticism incarnate.",1
1005,Star Trek Online,2017.0,"Not many years ago I would have given this game a thumbs up. Buut, time changes perspectives, and MMOs start to become unwieldy and grindy. From the reputatiojn system to the admiralty system to the various skill systems, the entire game is designed to cause you to spend as much time as posssible... managing skill points and inventory. I'm sure there are many people who consider this to be fun, but for me it has gotten quite tedious and has limited my ability to enjoy the gameplay. In addition, PvP is dead, if you want PvP, go somewhere else, it's all PvE in STO. If you like that, then great.I honestly started playing it because I was interested to see what they were doing with the prime universe. There's some great stuff in there, especially the New Romulus stuff. But I got to a point where I had to grind ceaselessly in order to unlock more missions and I stopped caring. Too much grinding for far too little reward. But that's the nature of F2P, hey? I don't doubt that it works, STO is going strong and is always full of people. But it's not for me.",0
10923,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,2017.0,"9 out of 10 of this game, and let me tell you, THIS Yu-Gi-Oh! mobile/PC version is one of the best childhood card game competition that ever played! No kidding, you'll have a lot of time playing this pocket-sized link vrains speed duel wannabe that you can get. Even though, the mobile version, you'll get a lot of time collecting cards and dueling your foes, but if it's not enough, then the PC version will blow you away. As they say: It's time to DUEL!!The downside of this game is that, even if you want to transfer your mobile game data to the PC version, you'll be ending up erasing your game for good. DO NOT DARE TO ERASE DUEL LINKS FROM YOUR PHONE WITHOUT TRANSFERING YOUR GAME DATA TO THIS VERSION!! If your game and deck is actually important to you then follow the transfer data steps carefully and don't erase the game without transfering your best deck. Well as for Duel Links, you'll get your lovable characters from your childhood from the show and the manga. (seriously the manga is great, until 4kids messed the anime so badly over a decade) All the characters are really there, which includes Yugi (Atem), Kaiba, Jounouchi (Joey), Mai, Anzu (Tea), and Yugi Muto, and even other minor characters that came to duel links and with all of their ace cards.. But that's not all, Konami brought it over the GX series with Jaden and company to keep the duel links running. And this game will make your life more easier than wasting your money on trading cards. However, as my perspective, I know Yu-Gi-Oh! very well, but that doesn't mean that I go crazy and collect more trading cards, I much rather play the game than spending my money on cards. However, even if you compete online on a rank duel, you'll get the fact that this game is far more competitive than the rest of the past Yu-Gi-Oh! games, even ygopro didn't cut it. So if I much rather play the mobile version more often, I would make this one my second duelist account of this version. The playthrough is great, but the other downside is that even if the game keeps going on the updates, I don't know if this game is already on its limits, because the dueling arena is just more like the speed duels on Vrains. But what if they added the 5DS era or the Zexal era, what will happen then?? If you're about to synchro summon, then how many of the tunner monsters and the actual monsters are going to fit on the field until you'll know when to do it. And when you XYZ summon, that's no problem, because you can only play only two XYZ monsters on the field, that's it. Well this isn't the everyday traditional Yu-Gi-Oh! dueling rules because somehow the rules have kept changing over the years. My best bet is that even if you want to try this game, you'll might have to start learning the rules of this dueling system.So keep dueling! Collect more cards, unlock new characters and gain more rare cards. And you'll be the strongest duelist ever around, so good luck. ",1
3108,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),2016.0,"Edited on 11/27/16 after break and 1 month return :This game is still great. I wish that this game continues to grow and thrive, and that more people will come to know it. This is a wonderfully unique game with so much class customization, unique gameplay between classes and sub-classes, as well as a living player run economy of all kinds of crafted weapons, recipes, items, armor sets, monster cards, gems, hats, and more! I am on Klaipeda (NA) and though the population has declined since launch, as all MMO's do, there are still plenty of people in town and you bump into people while out leveling all the time. Some sub-classes are able to sell class specific buffs that normally other people couldn't use, but you get to rent them for coin. Others repair your armor and weapons over the typically limit so you have to take less trips to town, and there are others as well who provide services to other players when they aren't out adventuring. There are just too many things that are great about this game. I wish that you would give it a chance and learn to love it like I do. Whether you want to have a few minutes soloing and grinding for ""zen"" feelings, or you want to get into a group to farm experience or items or run dungeons this game can accomodate many different feelings. If you need friends or are looking for a guild, please check out the Treeofsavior.com forums as well as Tree of Savior Fanbase which is also a great website for mapping out your Class builds and all your skill points. There is also an item search database on that website for when you are having trouble finding something or someone. This game has been touted as the ""spiritual succesor of Ragnarok Online"" and it holds true to that, but It's also so much more including much more varied class choice, customization and an incredibly more fluid movement and combat system. Good luck, and may the Goddess watch over you!Eldaran - Klaipeda Server (NA)",1

2743,Realm Grinder,2018.0,"Surely the best clicker/idle game I've played, lots of mechanics that are introduced as the game progresses, a challenge as much as a grind (as clearly stated from the title).

20429,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewWhile it used to be a great game, and the concept is cool, recent updates with new weapons and major changes to mechanics has made the game almost completely unenjoyable, and even downright agrevating, with terrible tier systems, and no good way to get better parts for people in lower levels",0
12865,Shadowverse CCG,2017.0,"While I enjoy the art and the story. this was a very frustrating game for me. In story mode, the computer AI, plays the same cards over and over again with the exact sequence of moves. Meanwhile my class has the basic cards, and they are mixed up too well each time. I tried adjusting my deck over and over again to play against the same AI class, with no luck. They really need to make the story play easier. Yes, the first two rounds are freaking easy, then the AI suddenly changes into god mode and wipes me out quickly. Also, when I play PVP (Not ranked) the computer puts me up against players who have many more advanced cards than I do, and special decks that are in the store. They are very hard to compete against, when a new player only has the basic cards. I have played several other CCG games, but at least I did win about 30-40 percent of the time. So I'm no newb to these games. At least HS computer matches people up well with similar level cards. In Shadowverse it's a slaughter! Definitely a Play to Win game!  :-(",0

15919,World of Warships,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewNot going to start over for one simple reason. Why should you start over when you already have a WG account from the original WoWS days, then you download this game because you wanted to get the Steam version, but just to find out that you have to start all over. They failed to tell you that on the store page for those who already have an account. No transferring, no linking, nothing. So no starting overEDIT, follow this guide and you'll have your original WG account and can be used for the Steam version as wellhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1200479870Thank to imrahil2  for telling me",0
15931,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Updated review after 600+ hours played: give this game a try if you like MTG. It's like MTG with a little bit of RNG mixed in. Lots of fun to play and one of the (if not THE) most f2p friendly CCGs.,1
11416,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI understand that the game should be fun and silly seeing as what it is, but it's downright unplayable. The crosshair doesn't show where you're aiming, the knife is a one hit kill and it seems that no matter how much ammo you pour into someone, they won't die. I've only been killed by knives because nobody uses firearms. The movement is very bad and even though I have a low ping (roughly 30 ms) and high frames (120 frame locked) the game is very choppy. When I corrected the volume so the enviroment wasn't too loud, I noticed the gun fire was almost silent compared to footsteps, doors, ambient sounds, etc. I know I got it for free, but what about the people that pay for it? Had I paid for it, I would refund it almost immediately.",0
550,Robocraft,2016.0,"After coming back to the game after a long while, I'm happy to say that the game has been improved alot. However, it still isn't even close to as good as it was in 2014. Lootcrates being the only form of getting building materials is gone. Actually, lootcrates entirely are gone. That's a step in the right direction. However, alot of new content has been added. This has caused alot of the weapons to suffer from a severe case of power creep, and has sadly made quite a few vehicles useless. Specifically, plasma bombers (Planes that rely on plasma cannons to do damage.) have been made nearly useless. Planes in general now have many counters. I.E flak guns, homing missiles, etc. I also don't like how vehicles can now have more than one type of weapon on them. This, again, destroys planes aswell as many other designs. Everyone and their mother and father is usually going to have all types of weapons on them. Now, everyone can serve as anti air, anti tank and medics. This is not good. It turns everyone into a one man army. My suggestion to fix this is to buff the original weapons, mainly the plasma launcher. Even for ground vehicles, the plasma launcher is overshadow'd by alot of the other, better weapons. Another suggestion to fix this would be to force vehicles to only have 1 type of weapon.The gamemodes are okayish. Team Deathmatch is your typical 5v5 first to 15 kills wins. The other gamemode (Going past league ranked, and PVE) turns the game into a MOBA. Which, I don't agree with. Why the good old 15v15 1 life only PVP mode is gone, I will never know. That was the best mode. My suggestion to fix this is to simply put the 15v15 PVP mode back into the game, as the primary mode.The removal of the pilot seat pretty much ruined combat, as all strategy can be thrown out the window. The bad gamemodes also means that all strategy can be thrown out the window. Now, instead of aiming for where you think the enemy pilot is, you just aim in the enemies general direction. How to fix this? Simple. Add the pilot seat back.With the removal of the requirement of a pilot seat, armour blocks have also been removed.  This only encourages people to spam blocks ontop of eachother, with no care put into them other than ""How much health can I have?"" and ""how big of a surface area can I get for all of the weapons in the entire game to fit onto my vehicle?"". Also, health blocks are free, so it's alot easier to spam health blocks. My suggestion? Bring back armour blocks, And if the devs do decide to let players use multiple types of weapons on a single vehicle, countermeasures should be added for homing missiles, aswell as flak. (I'm not sure how you would create a countermeasure for flak, but an idea for that would be a shield that can temporarily block nearby flak damage.) Also, add tiering back.Oh, and leveling up is way too easy. And you get 1 tech point per level. Take this with a grain of salt, as I ended up starting at level 51 because I had played back in the early days of the game, and thus, had started with around 50 Tech Points, which let me research alot of equipment easily. Bear this in mind, the maximum that I know one of the researchable technology costs is 5 tech points. Most of them are only 1 or 2 tech points to research. You can litterally kill no one, die 5 times and lose the game, and you'll still level up. And that's in the level 50s, imagine how fast you'll progress through the lower levels. I know this because I wanted to see if I'd actually level up like that. Which, I did. To fix this, as you probably assumed, make it harder to level up.The main good thing isn't about the game itself, it's about the developers. They actually will read a good portion of the reviews they recieve, hence why I'm going into detail about each of the main problems that the game faces. In its current state, I would not reccomend it. However, I would keep an eye on it, as the devs may fix alot of the current problems, due to how they respond to criticism in a positive manner. It may just be that I'm looking at the game through rose tinted nostalgia goggles. As the devs said in a dev blog, ""There's no 'revert to 2014' button.""",0
